<TITLE>- The binding of acetaldehyde to the active site of ribonuclease: alterations in catalytic activity and effects of phosphate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ribonuclease A was reacted with [1-13C,1,2-14C]acetaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence or absence of 0.2 M phosphate. After several hours of incubation at 4 degrees C (pH 7.4) stable acetaldehyde-RNase adducts were formed, and the extent of their formation was similar regardless of the presence of phosphate. Although the total amount of covalent binding was comparable in the absence or presence of phosphate, this active site ligand prevented the inhibition of enzymatic activity seen in its absence. This protective action of phosphate diminished with progressive ethylation of RNase, indicating that the reversible association of phosphate with the active site lysyl residue was overcome by the irreversible process of reductive ethylation. Modified RNase was analysed using 13C proton decoupled NMR spectroscopy. Peaks arising from the covalent binding of enriched acetaldehyde to free amino groups in the absence of phosphate were as follows: NH2-terminal alpha amino group, 47.3 ppm; bulk ethylation at epsilon amino groups of nonessential lysyl residues, 43.0 ppm; and the epsilon amino group of lysine-41 at the active site, 47.4 ppm. In the spectrum of RNase ethylated in the presence of phosphate, the peak at 47.4 ppm was absent. When RNase was selectively premethylated in the presence of phosphate, to block all but the active site lysyl residues and then ethylated in its absence, the signal at 43.0 ppm was greatly diminished, and that arising from the active site lysyl residue at 47.4 ppm was enhanced. These results indicate that phosphate specifically protected the active site lysine from reaction with acetaldehyde, and that modification of this lysine by acetaldehyde adduct formation resulted in inhibition of catalytic activity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reductions in breath ethanol readings in normal male volunteers following mouth rinsing with water at differing temperatures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Blood ethanol concentrations were measured sequentially, over a period of hours, using a Lion AE-D2 alcolmeter, in 12 healthy male subjects given oral ethanol 0.5 g/kg body wt. Readings were taken before and after rinsing the mouth with water at varying temperatures. Mouth rinsing resulted in a reduction in the alcolmeter readings at all water temperatures tested. The magnitude of the reduction was greater after rinsing with water at lower temperatures. This effect occurs because rinsing cools the mouth and dilutes retained saliva. This finding should be taken into account whenever breath analysis is used to estimate blood ethanol concentrations in experimental situations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Does the blockade of opioid receptors influence the development of ethanol dependence?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have tested whether the opioid antagonists naloxone (2 mg/kg), naltrexone (2 mg/kg) and diprenorphine (0.2 mg/kg), and the agonist morphine (4-8 mg/kg) given subcutaneously (10 min before ethanol for 7 days) modify the ethanol withdrawal syndrome (audiogenic seizures) following chronic ethanol intoxication in rats. We found that naloxone, naltrexone and diprenorphine modified the ethanol withdrawal syndrome. These findings do not rule out the possibility of a biochemical link between the action of ethanol and opiates at the level of opioid receptors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Drinkwatchers--description of subjects and evaluation of laboratory markers of heavy drinking.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clinical examination and measurement of MCV and GGT were carried out on 124 self-referred 'healthy' Drinkwatchers, all of whom had consumed at least 80 g alcohol/day for more than 2 years. The majority (66.1%) were in social classes II and III. Sixty-three subjects (54.1%) had a raised MCV, GGT or hepatomegaly. A raised MCV was significantly more likely to occur in men. Forty-five subjects (36.3%) had an enlarged liver of whom 17 had a normal MCV and GGT. This study shows that MCV and GGT are poor screening tests for excessive alcohol consumption in 'healthy' subjects but, if used at all, MCV appears to be more sensitive in women and GGT in men. Neither test is an adequate substitute for a careful history and full clinical examination.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Platelet affinity for serotonin is increased in alcoholics and former alcoholics: a biological marker for dependence?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The kinetics of 3H serotonin platelet uptake were studied in alcoholics and former alcoholics to see whether differences found between alcohol-preferring and non-preferring rats could be reproduced in man. Three groups of patients were studied: 10 dependent alcoholics on admission for treatment; 10 dependent alcoholics after 20 days of treatment; 8 former dependent alcoholics, abstinent for 1-11 years. Controls were non-alcoholics, matched for age and sex. The Km for 3H serotonin uptake in platelets was lower in patients from all three groups compared to 15 controls. This phenomenon could be congenital or induced by the previous excessive intake of alcohol. We believe that this increased platelet affinity for serotonin, in the absence of cirrhosis of the liver and/or depression could be a marker for alcohol dependence, enabling the therapeutic effort to be focussed on these patients.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of an i.v. bolus of clonidine (1.5 mg/kg) on withdrawal symptoms were studied in 7 male alcoholics, and compared with 7 normal controls. Clonidine reduced both subjective and objective measures of withdrawal but this only reached significance for scores of depression and muscle tension. In comparison with controls alcoholics in withdrawal showed reduced sedative effects of clonidine.</ABSTRACT>

- This paper presents data from a general population survey of three areas of Britain which manifest considerable differences in official rates of problem drinking, yet show similar patterns and levels of alcohol consumption. Consideration of various sources of bias (non-response, forgetting, selective under-reporting, and interviewer) suggest that they do not differentially influence self-reported alcohol consumption in the three areas.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Factors associated with young adult alcohol abuse.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The present study examined correlates of alcohol abuse among university students which have been conceptually linked to the developmental transitions faced by this population. Individual and family developmental theories led to the hypothesis that sex role identity conflict and stresses within the student's family of origin would be positively related to alcohol abuse scores. As expected, an accumulation of family stresses was related to alcohol abuse scores for both men and women. However, for each sex only one of the four sex role conflict variables which were considered was significantly related to alcohol abuse scores. For women, this variable was femininity conflict, while for men it was affiliation conflict.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Alcohol and the elderly: relationships to illness and smoking.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A group of 33 semi-independent living nonagenarian men and a group of 32 65-75 year-old men of similar demographic characteristics, living at the California Veterans' Home, were compared in terms of alcohol use, past and present, and relationships to several somatic, mental and lifestyle aspects including smoking. The younger group had a higher prevalence of alcohol abuse and higher current alcohol intake (P less than 0.004). Higher alcohol intake related to greater smoking of cigarettes in the younger group. Alcohol tended to be related to an increased number of medical illnesses, and to increased use of major medications (P less than 0.005). There was an interactive effect between classes of alcohol use and scores on a mental status examination used to assess cognitive function (P less than 0.05).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Potentiation of the neuromuscular blockade produced by alcuronium with halothane, enflurane and isoflurane.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The potentiation of alcuronium by halothane, enflurane and isoflurane was investigated using electromyography. In the first study, cumulative dose-response curves were constructed in four groups of 10 patients anaesthetized with one of the inhalation agents and nitrous oxide, or with fentanyl and droperidol (control). All three agents reduced the ED50 of alcuronium; the effect was marked with isoflurane (P less than 0.005) but less so with halothane (P less than 0.05) and enflurane (ns). In the second part of the investigation, designed primarily to test the duration of action of alcuronium with each agent, a single bolus dose of alcuronium 0.2 mg kg-1 was given to four similar groups (n = 5). The duration of action was significantly prolonged by enflurane (P less than 0.01) and isoflurane (P less than 0.05), but not by halothane. The possible reasons for this are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Integrated electromyographic studies in burned patients, and in normal controls, during the administration of small doses of suxamethonium (0.1 or 0.2 mg kg-1) have shown that the level of paralysis and the duration of paralysis are significantly increased in burn patients and that the effect is greater with larger burns. Repeated studies on patients using these small doses have shown that patients with burns pass through a phase of extreme sensitivity to the effects of suxamethonium, usually sometime between 4 and 12 days after the burn.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane on bronchomotor tone in anaesthetized ponies.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of halothane, enflurane and isoflurane on bronchial calibre were investigated in five anaesthetized ponies using a computer-aided forced airflow oscillation technique to derive specific lower airways conductance (s.Glaw) and expiratory reserve volume (ERV). All the agents tended to increase s.Glaw (indicating bronchodilatation), but ERV was reduced by halothane and enflurane, and increased by isoflurane. It was concluded that the effects of these agents on bronchomotor tone were similar to those which occur in man. However, the reasons for the differences in their effects on ERV compared with those found in man remain to be determined.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Autotransfusion: quality of blood prepared with a red cell processing device.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The quality of blood salvaged at operation and prepared with the Dideco Autotrans BT 795 autotransfusion device was compared with that of donor blood in 41 patients having cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass. Saved blood had a higher haemoglobin concentration (17.3 v. 13.1 g dl-1; P less than 0.001), a higher 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration (5.3 v. 1.1 mmol litre-1; P less than 0.00001), higher white cell count (17.1 X 10(9) litre-1 v. 4.1; P less than 0.00001), higher pH (7.5 v. 6.6; P less than 0.00001) and a more physiological potassium concentration (5.4 v. 8.8 mmol litre-1; P less than 0.00001) than donor blood. Saved blood platelet count was 34.5 X 10(9) litre-1 compared with 146.24 X 10(9) litre-1 (P less than 0.00001) and its heparin concentration was 0.64 u. ml-1. We conclude that this autotransfusor is a useful aid to blood conservation, producing good quality red cells with relatively normal pH and potassium values. However, modification of the centrifugation and washing is required to lessen the high white cell count and heparin concentrations found in the saved blood.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibition of rat fetal methionine synthase by nitrous oxide. An in vitro study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of in vitro exposure to nitrous oxide on rat fetal and maternal methionine synthase activity was investigated. Enzyme solutions were prepared from livers of fetuses and mothers on day 19 of gestation and exposed to air, 50% oxygen or 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen for periods up to 24 h. Normal activity of methionine synthase in the fetus was about 65% of that in the mother. Activity decreased by about 25% over 24 h when the enzyme was incubated at 37 degrees C in the presence of either air or 50% oxygen. Nitrous oxide produced a time-dependent decrease in activity which generally was similar for both fetal and maternal enzyme. After 24 h exposure to nitrous oxide, activity has decreased to 14 and 17% of fetal and maternal control values, respectively.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Four hundred and thirty blood samples from suxamethonium-sensitive individuals have been phenotyped by the Cholinesterase Research Unit following its transfer from Exeter to the Hammersmith Hospital. The distribution of genotypes has been shown to be similar to that found in Exeter. Screening for the Elk and Elj genes has not yielded any major differences in the gene frequencies of sensitive individuals, even during pregnancy. The uneven sex distribution of the patients, as well as other unusual points that have arisen, are discussed. A new gene for the biosynthesis of cholinesterase has probably been identified.</ABSTRACT>

- An 11-yr-old girl suffered a massive pulmonary embolus during an operation to insert an artificial bladder sphincter. Forty minutes after the induction of anaesthesia, the heart rate increased and she became hypotensive and deeply cyanosed. A definitive diagnosis was not made during surgery, but she improved after 45 min of resuscitation with 100% oxygen, infusion of normal saline, ephedrine (total 45 mg) and intermittent external cardiac massage. The diagnosis was proved the next day by lung perfusion scan. There were no apparent risk factors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of the effects of atropine and glycopyrrolate on cognitive function following general anaesthesia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Tests of orientation, concentration and short-term visual memory were used to assess 72 patients 1 day before, and 2 days after, elective major surgery. Patients were premedicated with papaveretum and either atropine or glycopyrrolate, before receiving a standard general anaesthetic. Those who had received atropine showed significant postoperative short-term memory deficit (P less than 0.01), but no change in orientation or concentration. Those who had been given glycopyrrolate showed no significant cognitive changes after surgery. As glycopyrrolate does not cross the blood-brain barrier freely, these findings support the involvement of central cholinergic mechanisms in the deterioration of cognitive function in the postoperative period.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Use of simple tests to determine the residual effects of the analgesic component of balanced anaesthesia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In order to evaluate simple means of determining the rate of recovery after general anaesthesia, the usefulness of the critical flicker fusion threshold test, the Maddox wing apparatus and the visual analogue scale were compared. The postanaesthetic recovery score was used as a reference. Two patient groups (n = 15 in each) received, in a randomized double-blind study, a similar balanced anaesthesia for Caesarean section, except that the analgesic component was either fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1 i.v. or buprenorphine 7.5 micrograms kg-1 i.v. Maddox wing apparatus and visual analogue scale were sensitive enough to differentiate between the postanaesthetic residual effects of the two opioids, but critical flicker fusion threshold and, especially, postanaesthetic recovery score were insensitive in this respect. There was no difference between the two patient groups in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Our results show that the residual effects of different kinds of opioids as an analgesic component of balanced anaesthesia can be differentiated using simple means like Maddox wing apparatus and visual analogue scales.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Electrical and mechanical responses after neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium, and subsequent antagonism with neostigmine or edrophonium.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Six unpremedicated patients who had given their informed consent were given vecuronium 0.08 mg kg-1 before elective surgery. Recovery from neuromuscular blockade was measured electrically and mechanically. Neuromuscular blockade was antagonized 1 h after the administration of vecuronium with two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg (three patients) or edrophonium 0.5 mg kg-1 (three patients). Although the onset of initial recovery was similar, subsequent recovery was faster when measured electrically (EMG) than when measured mechanically. Recovery appeared to be faster in younger patients. Reintroduction of neuromuscular blockade occurred after the second dose of neostigmine 2.5 mg, given to antagonize the block. This did not occur after either dose of edrophonium 0.5 mg kg-1.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Onset and recovery of atracurium and suxamethonium-induced neuromuscular blockade with simultaneous train-of-four and single twitch stimulation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Single twitch and train-of-four stimulation were applied at 0.08 Hz to each ulnar nerve and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis was recorded during onset of and recovery from neuromuscular blockade by suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1 or atracurium 0.4 mg kg-1. Times to 90% first twitch blockade of train-of-four were (mean +/- SEM) 0.82 +/- 0.08 and 1.98 +/- 0.18 min for suxamethonium and atracurium, respectively, compared with times to 90% single twitch blockade of 1.00 +/- 0.07 and 3.35 +/- 0.37 min, respectively (P less than 0.05 in both cases). Apparent onset time also depended on how long train-of-four stimulation had been applied before injection of atracurium. The mode of stimulation had little effect on time to 10% recovery. The results are consistent with stimulation-induced augmentation in muscle blood flow, which increased delivery of the drug to the neuromuscular junction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Atracurium, vecuronium and pancuronium in end-stage renal failure. Dose-response properties and interactions with azathioprine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Dose-response relations for atracurium, vecuronium and pancuronium were determined in patients in end-stage renal failure for the initial neuromuscular blockade (using three cumulative doses) and for the maintenance of stable 90% response (during continuous infusion). All measurements were during renal transplant surgery, and the interaction of azathioprine on neuromuscular blockade was estimated. Mean ED95 doses were (microgram kg-1): atracurium 375.6, vecuronium 67.2, pancuronium 86.6; the initial blockade required significantly larger doses than in normal patients (37%, 20% and 45%, respectively, using ED50 values). Mean infusion rates for 90% sustained blockade in renal failure were (microgram kg-1 h-1): atracurium 409.4, vecuronium 78.3, pancuronium 14.2. The atracurium dose was not influenced by renal function, whereas vecuronium and pancuronium requirements were significantly reduced by 23.2% and 61.5%, respectively, compared with normal patients (previous study). Azathioprine was injected at the rate of 1 mg kg-1 min-1 for 3 min at stable 90% neuromuscular blockade with constant-rate infusion of the neuromuscular blocking drug. This produced a relatively small and transient antagonism of blockade--probably of negligible clinical significance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Control of the immune response to contact sensitizing chemicals by cutaneous antigen-presenting cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The fate of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, a potent contact sensitizing chemical, and 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, a non-sensitizer, was compared following their application to the skin of BALB/c mice. Although both chemicals were able to bind to protein in vitro and were capable of being absorbed across mouse skin in vivo, only 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene was able to bind to cells in the skin and to induce the movement of these cells from the epidermis into the dermis and ultimately into the draining lymph nodes. The sensitization potential of a chemical may therefore be dependent on its ability to associate with and stimulate the efflux of cutaneous antigen-presenting cells.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Sun-exposed and sun-protected skin obtained at post mortem from the nape of the neck in 14 subjects was immunostained using antisera to elastin, lysozyme, amyloid P component, and the plasma protease inhibitors alpha-I antitrypsin, alpha-I antichymotrypsin and alpha-2 macroglobulin. Both the normal elastic fibres in sun-protected skin, and elastosis in sun-exposed skin were positively immunostained for elastin, lysozyme and amyloid P component. Collagen fibres were unstained. No immunostaining of normal elastic fibres or elastosis in the skin was obtained with antisera to alpha-I antitrypsin, alpha-I antichymotrypsin or alpha-2 macroglobulin. It was concluded that the elastosis in sun-exposed skin does contain elastic fibres. The absence of immunostaining for plasma protease inhibitors probably indicates that the elastic material is mature, and not newly-formed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Formalin sensitivity and differential staining of mast cells in human dermis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The characteristics of the human dermal mast cell population with respect to formalin fixation sensitivity, toluidine blue staining and alcian blue/safranin staining were studied. Thirty-seven specimens of normal human skin were bisected. One half was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and the other in Carnoy's fixative. Sections were cut and stained with either toluidine blue or alcian blue/safranin. Significantly more mast cells were visualized with alcian blue/safranin than with toluidine blue. With both stains, only approximately 50% of the mast cells observed in the Carnoy's fixed tissue could be visualized in the formalin-fixed tissue. Alcian blue/safranin staining revealed three patterns of mast cell granule staining: mast cells containing only alcian blue-positive granules, mast cells containing only safranin-positive granules, and mast cells containing a mixture of alcian blue-positive granules and safranin-positive granules. Mast cells containing only alcian blue-positive granules constituted the majority of the dermal mast cell population and 73% of these mast cells were formalin-sensitive. Mast cells containing only safranin-positive granules and those containing a mixture of alcian blue-positive granules and safranin-positive granules showed no evidence of formalin sensitivity. The human dermal mast cell population, therefore, displays heterogeneity with respect to formalin fixation sensitivity and alcian blue/safranin staining. Dermal mast cells were visualized in significantly greater numbers in skin from the head compared with that from the body or limbs.</ABSTRACT>

To assess whether galactosaemia plays any part in the development of atopic cataracts a galactose tolerance test was carried out in eight atopic dermatitis patients whose cataracts had appeared between the ages of 12 and 39 years. In seven patients a normal result was obtained and in one the result was just above normal. Impaired galactose tolerance appears to have no role in the pathogenesis of atopic cataract.</ABSTRACT>

- Sebum excretion rate was measured by a photometric technique. We demonstrated a high correlation between sebum excretion rates on the left and right sides of the upper back and between back and forehead skin. Sebum excretion rate measurements overlying an open comedone (blackhead) were significantly lower than those obtained from normal skin. This observation demonstrates a functional obstruction to the outflow of sebum and would suggest that the lack of involvement of open comedones in inflammatory acne is not because of the maintenance of a free flow of sebum.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The erythemal response of normal human skin to UVA and UVB radiation was measured objectively using a reflectance instrument in seven subjects, and a laser Doppler velocimeter in two subjects. UVA radiation was produced using a newly-developed high-intensity UVA lamp. The slope of the log dose-erythemal response curve for UVA at 24 h after irradiation was found not to differ significantly from that for UVB. The time course of UVA erythema was biphasic; erythema was present immediately after irradiation, fell to a minimum at about 4 h and then rose to a broad plateau between 6 and 24 h. The intensity of the early phase was dose-rate dependent, whereas that in the later phase depended on dose only.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Toxicity of the anthraquinone glycoside P-1894B for human skin fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- P-1894B inhibits prolyl hydroxylase in vitro and has been proposed as a topical treatment for dermal fibrosis. The drug had similar effects on two fibroblast lines from normal human skin and one line from a patient with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. Exposure of logarithmically-growing cell monolayers for 72 h caused dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation at 0.05-0.5 microgram/ml but time-dependent cell death at 1-50 micrograms/ml. The epithelial cell line NCTC 2544 gave a similar result. Collagen lattices containing normal fibroblasts contracted more slowly in the presence of the drug at 0.1-0.5 microgram/ml, but this was clearly related to loss of viability. Collagen synthesis by monolayer cultures was unaffected at 0.05 and 0.1 microgram/ml P-1894B in one line of normal fibroblasts, but was reduced by 40% and 15%, respectively, in the other. The concentrations of P-1894B reported to be active against prolyl hydroxylase are therefore lethal to cultured skin cells. Although the effective use of dithranol as a topical anti-psoriatic agent, despite its cytotoxicity in vitro, is encouraging for P-1894B, further toxicological studies are imperative.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I was diagnosed in an 18-year-old girl on the basis of marked skin hyperextensibility with generalized loose-jointedness, pigmented paper-tissue scars, and a pronounced tendency to bruising. Her father and one of her sisters showed a similar phenotype. Her mother was normal. Light microscopy of skin biopsies showed large, irregular collagen fibres in the father and daughter, with normal findings in the mother. Electron microscopy of the skin sections revealed a variation in diameter and shape of the collagen fibrils as well as slight dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of fibroblasts in father and daughter, but normal findings in the mother. Cultured fibroblasts did not show these changes. Measurements of collagen synthesis by fibroblast cultures showed that type III collagen levels were reduced to 50% of normal in the father and daughter, and were normal in the mother. The alpha I (III) proteins had a normal molecular weight, determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The phenotypes and biochemical results in the family members tested were compatible with autosomal dominant transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a type III collagen deficiency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I. The findings in this family, especially the pronounced bruising tendency, illustrate the heterogeneity within type I EDS.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tattoo removal using infra-red coagulation: a dose comparison.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Using an infra-red coagulator, 42 tattoos were treated using pulses of 1.125 s (27 tattoos) or 1.25 s (15 tattoos). Treatment failures occurred only in three professional tattoos. Amateur tattoos were satisfactorily treated in over 80% of cases regardless of dose. Deeper collagen necrosis occurred with 1.25 s, but scarring was clinically similar. Pre-treatment biopsy to assess pigment depth was of no value in selection of the optimum pulse duration and increased the complication rate. The possible mechanism of pigment removal is discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Polymorphonuclear leukocyte function in psoriasis vulgaris.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) migration was assessed in vitro using the agarose plate method in patients with psoriasis vulgaris, and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group. No significant difference was found between the two groups in the PMN response to the chemotactic substances F-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) or zymosan activated serum (ZAS). Equally, the chemokinetic or chemotactic potential of psoriatic serum did not differ from control serum. Our results do not support a primary abnormality of PMN function in psoriasis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A flow cytometric study of the significance of DNA aneuploidy in cutaneous lesions.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Aneuploidy has not to date been demonstrated in any entirely benign condition and thus is held to be implicit of neoplasia. DNA flow cytometry can be used to detect DNA aneuploidy rapidly. A technique has been developed to make possible flow cytometric analysis of formalin-fixed skin. The technique was validated by study of benign and pre-malignant dermatoses. Further studies were performed on skin conditions of questionable malignant potential. DNA aneuploidy was demonstrated in lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. Flow cytometry was unable to distinguish keratoacanthomas from squamous cell carcinomas.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The production of inflammatory compounds by Propionibacterium acnes and other skin organisms.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Culture supernatants from four species of skin microorganisms (P. acnes, P. avidum, P. granulosum and S. epidermidis) were assayed for smooth muscle contracting substances which are indicative of inflammatory activity. At least three types of smooth muscle contracting substances were detected. These were: first, a substance active on a rat fundic strip preparation and antagonized by N,N-DMT. Activity was enhanced when cultures were grown in the presence of tryptophan. This substance was probably tryptamine. Second, a substance active on a guinea-pig ileum preparation and antagonized by mepyramine. Activity was enhanced when cultures were grown in the presence of histidine. This substance was probably histamine. Third, a substance active on a rat fundic strip preparation but not antagonized by N,N-DMT, mepyramine, atropine or indomethacin. Activity was enhanced when cultures were grown in the presence of glucose. This activity was probably due to acetate, propionate or other short-chain fatty-acid salts. Chromatographic analysis confirmed the presence of histamine, tryptamine and short-chain fatty acids in the culture supernatants. These substances if produced in vivo may cause or contribute to inflammation and pain directly without the prior mediation of the immune system. Cell extracts of Propionibacterium species were analysed by bioassay for the presence of prostaglandin-like compounds. These could not be detected in any of the eight strains of organisms tested.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- IgA anti-endomysial antibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis: correlation with jejunal morphology, gluten-free diet and anti-gliadin antibodies.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Circulating IgA-class anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA) can be detected by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey oesophagus sections. We found EmA in 22 (76%) of 29 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) on a normal, gluten-containing diet. The highest frequency (100%) of EmA was observed in patients with sub-total villous atrophy. IgA-class antigliadin antibodies (AGA) were found using an ELISA method in 59% of 29 DH patients and in 86% of those with sub-total villous atrophy. There was a significant correlation between EmA titres and AGA levels in individual patients. Gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment caused a rapid decrease in EmA titres; only three of the 12 patients still showed raised EmA after 6-12 months on a GFD and two of these three had failed to adhere to a strict diet. In contrast, no decrease in EmA titres occurred in four patients maintained on a normal diet, and two of the three patients with initially negative EmA developed positive titres when continuing on a normal diet. These results show that both IgA-class EmA and AGA are good indicators of jejunal damage in DH. The rapid fall of EmA titres after gluten withdrawal indicates that this test is also useful for monitoring a patient's adherence to a GFD.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Blood flow in psoriatic skin lesions: the effect of treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) was used to assess the effect of treatment upon cutaneous blood flow in psoriatic skin lesions. The resolution of two separate plaques in each of seven subjects was followed. Six of the subjects received the Goeckerman regimen, the seventh was treated with psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy. Control LDV readings were taken from uninvolved skin sites during the treatment period. Cutaneous blood flow in the psoriatic lesions of the Goeckerman-treated patients decreased to levels comparable to those in uninvolved skin early in the course of treatment and significantly preceeded the observed clinical resolution from 4 to 8 days after initiation of therapy (P less than 0.05). Visible flare-ups sometimes appeared when patients were untreated (over a weekend, for example) and these eruptions were accompanied by a transient elevation of LDV readings. Perfusion of the lesions of the PUVA-treated patient remained consistently higher than perfusion of uninvolved skin despite clinical healing. In a separate series of experiments, blood flow at the extensor surface of the forearm was measured in the skin of normal subjects, the uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients and the untreated lesional skin of psoriatic patients. While the lesional skin had significantly higher perfusion levels than uninvolved psoriatic or normal control skin (P less than 0.01), there was no significant difference between blood flow to the uninvolved psoriatic skin of psoriatics and that to the skin of healthy controls.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Binding of 8-methoxypsoralen to human serum proteins and red blood cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Serum binding of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) was studied by equilibrium dialysis. In therapeutic concentrations, 8-MOP binding in serum was high, 91.4%, and constant, indicating concentration-independent kinetics. This binding involved the two main proteins, human serum albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, in a saturable process with one class of binding sites (n) and affinity constants (Ka) of 1.295 X 10(4) mol/l and 2.115 X 10(4) mol/l, respectively. Binding to lipoproteins and gamma globulins was negligible and non-saturable in therapeutic concentrations, with nKa values of 0.35, 0.024, 0.013 and 0.0004 mumol/l for VLDL, LDL, HDL and gamma globulins, respectively. Inhibition of 8-MOP serum binding was observed with salicylic acid and indomethacin, but not with diazepam, warfarin or erythromycin. Over a range of therapeutic concentrations, the ration of 8-MOP concentration in red blood cells (RBCs) and in serum was constant at 20.3% and three times higher than would be expected if a simple diffusion of the 8-MOP plasma free fraction (fu) occurred. According to the measured and calculated parameters, simulations of 8-MOP blood binding in pathological states (hypoalbuminaemia with or without inflammation) showed variations of fu which were partially 'buffered' by RBCs. Simulation of 8-MOP protein binding at cutaneous interstitial fluid level showed that fu is approximately 30% and permitted prediction of a decrease of fu available to the epidermis in case of local or systemic inflammation. This may imply an increase in the minimum phototoxic dose relevant for PUVA and explain some cases of 'poor' responsiveness of psoriatic patients to PUVA therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Two hundred and eighty-six patients over the age of 65 (age range 65-102, mean age 82 years), who were hospitalized in geriatric wards, were examined clinically for the presence of sebaceous gland hyperplasia and senile comedones. The degree of solar elastotic change present was scored on a visual analogue scale. The prevalence rate of sebaceous gland hyperplasia and of senile comedones was found to be 26% in each case. Approximately one third of patients had both lesions. Neither of these lesions was related to either the degree of solar elastotic change or the skin type with regard to tanning ability. It was concluded that chronic solar exposure was not a likely cause of these common conditions.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The release and activity of salicylic acid from different ointment formulations was studied in vivo by staining the horny layer with silver nitrate and measuring the light reflectance profile over 56 h, after application of the ointment for 4 h. The peeling effect of an ointment containing 5% salicylic acid and 10% urea was tested and compared with 5% and 10% salicylic acid in petrolatum. It was shown that shedding from the stained sites was faster with the urea-containing preparation than with the classic petrolatum ointments. The method described can be used to assess the bioavailability of keratolytic agents incorporated in topical formulations.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Forty-six eyes with chronic open-angle glaucoma (COAG) and 24 eyes which had previously undergone trabeculectomy for COAG were studied and the postural response of the intraocular pressure compared with that of 70 normal eyes. In all three groups the greatest rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) occurred when the subject changed from the sitting to the lying position. In the control group this was never more than 2 mmHg in any subject. The rise was greater than 2 mmHg in 93% of the patients suffering from COAG who were treated medically and in 100% of the eyes of those on which trabeculectomy had been performed. The well recognised abnormal postural response of intraocular pressure in COAG appears both to be retained and to be unaffected in those eyes which have undergone trabeculectomy.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Fluorophotometry was carried out in nine cases of unilateral non-traumatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment successfully treated by a combination of local buckling and an encircling procedure with a silicone band. After topical instillation of fluorescein the change in its concentration in the anterior chamber was followed, from which the loss rate of the dye from the anterior chamber (k0) and the cornea-aqueous transfer coefficient (kc.ca) were estimated. The thickness of the cornea and the anterior chamber volume were also measured, and the aqueous flow rate and the corneal endothelial permeability were calculated in individual eyes. The examinations performed 4-18 months after operation showed that the aqueous flow rate in the operated eye fell to 85 (SD 12)% of that in the fellow control eye (p less than 0.005). In the operated eye the anterior chamber volume also fell significantly, and the corneal endothelial permeability may have decreased. Ocular hypotension after the detachment surgery with encirclement was attributable to a decrease in the aqueous flow rate.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- This report describes a 41-year-old man with an intraocular tumour misinterpreted clinically as choroidal melanoma. The fluorescein angiographic features were not fully characteristic of uveal malignancy, and indeed histopathology revealed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the retinal pigment epithelium. It is suggested that, in cases with the fundus and angiographic findings described here, the rare possibility of adenocarcinoma of retinal pigment epithelium should be kept in mind. Of particular interest were the changing pathological findings in the various parts of the tumour, which paralleled the fluorescein angiographic pattern.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diplopia after retinal detachment surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Diplopia following retinal detachment usually responds to simple measures. Fifteen out of 311 cases developed diplopia lasting more than three months after conventional retinal detachment surgery. Binocular single vision was restored in 12 of the 15 cases (80%). The mean follow-up was four years. Diplopia was eliminated stepwise. If prisms were ineffective, our first surgical procedure was removal of the scleral buckle. If the retina was flat, we were prepared to remove the buckle early. When diplopia persisted after buckle removal, we proceeded to strabismus surgery. Our most consistent results followed strabismus surgery on the untreated eye. Prisms alone restored binocular single vision in six patients (40%), one of whom preferred to adopt a compensatory head posture. Removal of the scleral buckle restored binocular single vision in three patients (20%), with the help of a prism in one case and a compensatory head posture in another. Binocular single vision was restored after buckle removal and strabismus surgery in three further patients (20%), one requiring a prism in addition. Binocular single vision was not restored in three patients (20%).</ABSTRACT>

Although clinically there was no muscle weakness or atrophy, specific histochemical and electron microscopic examinations showed mild but distinct myopathic changes, including abnormal oxidative enzyme activities, aggregates of enlarged mitochondria in the subsarcolemmal regions, and disruptions of myofilaments. Biochemical analyses of mitochondria isolated from muscle samples did not show and deficiency in respiratory-chain enzyme complexes or defect in content of cytochromes.

<TITLE>- Quantification of macular ischaemia in sickle cell retinopathy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Macular ischaemia has a central role in the pathophysiology and prognosis of retinal macular disease. We attempted to quantitate two of its major components as follows: vascular nonperfusion, by measuring the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), using fluorescein angiography; and functional damage, using automated perimetry of the central 30 degrees. Sickle cell disease was chosen for study because it was considered a prototype for a purely ischaemic retinopathy without an exudative component. We found that the FAZ measurement was reproducible and that the patients with maculopathy had statistically larger FAZs than the normal controls (p = 0.016, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In addition, scotomas measured by visual field perimetry were significantly larger in the sickle cell patients with maculopathy than in those without maculopathy. Our results showed that angiography and perimetry of the central 30 degrees were more sensitive tests for the detection of ischaemic macular disease than visual acuity and that macular ischaemia could be quantified by their use.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Is there any difference in the photobiological properties of melanins isolated from human blue and brown eyes?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Investigations were carried out to determine whether the melanin present in the blue and brown eyes were eumelanin, the melanin present in black hair and dark skin, or pheomelanin, the melanin present in red hair and the skin of people with red hair. Our results showed that UV-visible irradiation of blue or brown eye melanin did not produce any superoxide. Irradiation of 51Cr-labelled Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells in the presence of blue or brown eye melanin did not produce significant cell lysis. The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of blue and brown eye melanins were very similar to those of eumelanin. Comparison of these findings with our previous results indicated that the blue and brown eye melanins are essentially eumelanin. The ESR signals further suggested that in the case of both blue and brown eye melanins the iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retinal pigment epithelium did not differ.</ABSTRACT>

- We report a case of frosted branch angiitis in a 16-year-old-girl. She noted a sudden and severe visual disturbance in both eyes, without other systemic symptoms. Diffuse retinal oedema and unusual sheathing of retinal veins were characteristic in both fundi. Fluorescein angiography showed no occlusion of the sheathed retinal veins, but some paravenous extravasation of dye was found in the late phase. With high doses of systemic corticosteroids her fundi and visual acuity improved greatly, though the vessels continued to show severe narrowing. At three months the pattern visually evoked cortical potentials were found to be normal, while flash electroretinograms were absent. No systemic abnormality has been found to explain the aetiology of this condition.</ABSTRACT>

Another new medium (JM) containing bicarbonate-free glucose-phosphate Ringer solution and dextran 70 has been developed in Japan. New Zealand white rabbit corneas with scleral rims were stored in each medium at 4 degrees C for one or two weeks. The condition of the endothelium was evaluated histologically. Corneas preserved in both media were in good condition at the end of one week. Corneas preserved in K-Sol for two weeks showed fewer endothelial changes than similar tissue stored in JM for two weeks. Corneal swelling was also less in corneas preserved in K-Sol, than in corneas preserved in JM.</ABSTRACT>

- Of 99 children in the Royal Blind School, Edinburgh (which serves Scotland and part of N E England), 15 had optic atrophy (hydrocephalus 4, intracranial haemorrhage 2, prematurity 2, fetal distress 2, birth asphyxia 2, cerebral atrophy 1, cardiac arrest during hernia operation 1, and leukaemia 1). Fourteen had congenital cataract, 12 congenital retinal aplasia (Leber's congenital amaurosis) and 11 retinopathy of prematurity. There were small numbers in many other diagnostic categories, including three with non-accidental head injury. Mental retardation, spasticity, and nystagmus were frequent other correlates in all diagnostic categories. 'Very probably hereditary' was a conservative attribution in 36, while 'probable' seemed appropriate for 12-that is, almost 48% were hereditary. Only about 11 cases might have been prevented through genetic counselling, which testifies to the frequency of autosomal recessive hereditary disease, although no parents were consanguineous.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Experimental posterior uveitis. I: A clinical, angiographic, and pathological study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical, angiographic, and histopathological features of experimental posterior uveitis in the black hooded Lister rat are described. This mild form of experimental allergic uveoretinitis (EAU) is induced by sensitisation with retinal S antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant, and the inflammation produced is confined to the posterior segment of the eye. This allows for the first time precise photographic and angiographic documentation of the evolution of clinical signs, because there is minimal clouding of the vitreous by inflammatory cells. Clinically the disease is characterised by the appearance of disc oedema and periphlebitis, followed by focal infiltrates in the deep retinal layers, with eventual atrophy of the pigment epithelium. Histologically, retinal vasculitis is associated with focal mononuclear cell infiltration and necrosis of the photoreceptor layers. This model closely resembles the clinical features of idiopathic retinal vasculitis seen in man.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Corneal and intraocular penetration of topical and subconjunctival fusidic acid.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Corneal tissue absorption and intraocular penetration of fusidic acid were assessed in the rabbit after topical or subconjunctival application. Corneal tissue levels of fusidic acid one hour after the last topical application of the drug were well above the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for most Gram-positive and many Gram-negative organisms. Adequate levels were achieved in the aqueous at one hour following the last topical application, but no significant levels were detected in the vitreous. The corneal tissue and aqueous levels declined at 12 and 24 hours following the last drug application, however, corneal tissue levels at 24 hours were considered to be above the MICs for most Gram-positive organisms. A single subconjunctival injection of 100 mg of fusidic acid produced levels above the MICs of most organisms in the cornea, aqueous, and vitreous which persisted over 24 hours, but subconjunctival injection of fusidic acid at this concentration resulted in conjunctival necrosis and corneal decompensation. Fusidic acid penetrates well into avascular tissue and fully penetrates corneas with both intact and debrided epithelium, as evidenced by the intracameral drug levels. Good corneal penetration and absence of known topical toxicity make fusidic acid suitable for the treatment of microbial keratitis caused by susceptible organisms.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Visual function and pattern visual evoked response in optic neuritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The disparity between clinical visual function and pattern visual evoked response (VER) was studied in 53 patients who had suffered an attack of optic neuritis (ON) more than six months before. The visual functions tested included Snellen visual acuity, colour vision, visual field, and contrast sensitivity. The effect of pattern presentation, check size, and luminance was tested by recording VERs with several stimulus configurations. VER amplitudes were found to be associated with the outcome of all four clinical tests, independently of check size, luminance, or the presentation method used. On the other hand VER latencies were hardly ever related to the results of any of the four clinical visual tests. These findings support the idea that VER amplitude provides information about visual spatial perception, while VER latency is more related to the extent of demyelination.</ABSTRACT>

We describe two patients who presented with acute anterior uveitis and secondary glaucoma caused by intracameral third stage larvae of Gnathostoma spinigerum. The parasites were successfully removed, with preservation of good visual acuity. The initial infection may occur through consumption of contaminated water and/or raw or undercooked foods, while the eyes may be involved even years later.

<TITLE>- Carrier testing in hemophilia B with an immunoassay that distinguishes a prevalent factor IX dimorphism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Immunoassays with a monoclonal antibody (A-1) detect a prevalent dimorphism in plasma coagulation factor IX. The antibody was shown to react with a dimorphic segment of the normal factor IX sequence as follows. First, A-1 bound to isolated activation peptide (residues 146 through 180) prepared from activated factor IX from a normal plasma pool. Second, binding of recombinant factor IXs with A-1 or factor IX from normal individuals was strong only when they had Threonine (Thr) at position 148; factor IXs with the Alanine (Ala) allele at that position were far less reactive. Third, immunoblot reactivity of Escherichia coli fusion proteins containing known segments of the factor IX sequence restricted the epitope to residues 147 through 153. In 120 hemophilia B pedigrees, the Ala immunoassay allele frequency was 0.19 and did not differ from the Ala frequency in normal males. In 22 of 49 families, immunoassay testing was informative for classification of obligate or possible carriers. In one large family, 4 obligate carriers were heterozygous for the dimorphism and 3 of their 7 daughters were classified as carriers. In other families, when the affected member had less than 1 nmol/L factor IX antigen, heterozygosity for Thr/Ala alleles excluded the carrier state even when DNA studies were not informative. Strong linkage disequilibrium of Thr/Ala alleles with the common TaqI DNA polymorphism was found. Nineteen of 75 normal and hemophilic factor IX genes had the 1.3-kilobase (kb) fragment and coded for the Ala allele; the rest had the 1.8-kb fragment and coded for Thr. In selected families, the A-1 immunoassay is an inexpensive and rapid method to confirm and supplement restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of DNA for carrier testing.</ABSTRACT>

- Coated vesicles bearing the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex were isolated from rabbit reticulocytes by freeze-thaw cell lysis, followed by differential centrifugation with pelleting of vesicles at 100,000 g. Electronmicroscopy demonstrated the vesicles to have the characteristic morphology of coated vesicles, including the appearance of triskelions. The protein composition of the vesicles as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis included transferrin, transferrin receptor, and proteins of apparent mol wt of approximately 180,000, 140,000, 100,000, and 47,000 daltons. The 180,000 and 100,000 mol wt proteins were identified as clathrin and coated vesicle assembly factor proteins, respectively, by Western blot analyses. The vesicles had a Mg2+-dependent ATPase with a specific activity of approximately 8.5 nmoles ATP converted/min/mg vesicle protein. The vesicles could acidify the intravesicular space, as evidenced by the stimulation of the Mg2+-ATPase by the protonophore FCCP. Reticulocytes appear to be an excellent source of coated vesicles and as such should provide a model for studying the endocytosis of transferrin and the steps of iron uptake that proceed in these vesicles.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Platelet-associated and plasma anti-glycoprotein autoantibodies in chronic ITP.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is due to platelet destruction by circulating antiplatelet antibody. Although autoantibodies against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complex and GPIb have been demonstrated using various methods, practical assays for detection of platelet-associated or plasma autoantibodies have not been available. We studied 59 patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura in whom platelet-associated and plasma autoantibodies against the GPIIb/IIIa complex and GPIb were measured using a newly developed immunobead assay and a previously reported microtiter-well assay. Platelet-associated autoantibody was detected using the immunobead assay in 21 of 28 patients (75.0%; 13 with anti-GPIIb/IIIa, 8 with anti-GPIb). Plasma autoantibodies were noted in 34 of 59 patients (57.6%; 21 with anti-GPIIb/IIIa, 11 with anti-GPIb, and 2 with both). Positive results were noted in 30 of 59 patients using the immunobead assay and in only 14 of 59 using the microtiter-well assay, suggesting that solubilization of the platelets prior to antibody addition, as in the microtiter-well assay, alters epitope stability. Of the 31 thrombocytopenic control patients studied, all gave negative results using both assays. We conclude that these clinically adaptable assays allow detection of autoantibodies in most patients with chronic ITP, confirming the presence of an autoimmune process.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Survival after antilymphocyte globulin therapy for aplastic anemia depends on disease severity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sixty-four patients with aplastic anemia were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG Merieux) between 1980 and 1985. The actuarial survival for all patients was 53% at 6 years, with 79% survival for nonsevere aplastic anemia (NSAA) and 36% for severe aplastic anemia (SAA). The neutrophil and platelet counts before treatment with ALG were highly predictive of survival, whereas sex, age, and etiology were not. Duration of disease prior to ALG treatment was inversely related to survival, although this was not statistically significant. Survival was closely associated with response to ALG, especially for patients with SAA. The response to one course of ALG was 33%. Eighteen patients who did not respond to an initial course of ALG received a second course; of these, four (22%) responded. The overall response to one or two courses of ALG was 40%. The mean RBC volume (MCV) measured after ALG treatment was a useful early indicator of response. Both the minimum lymphocyte count during ALG therapy and the mean lymphocyte count after therapy, however, were not significantly different between responders and nonresponders. The disappointing survival of patients with SAA in this study may reflect the poor clinical condition of severely affected patients referred to us and/or the presence of longstanding aplasia. The importance of studying a large series of patients with long-term follow-up to assess ALG in the treatment of aplastic anemia is shown by this investigation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The molecular species composition of phosphatidylcholine affects cellular properties in normal and sickle erythrocytes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The phosphatidylcholine specific transfer protein (PCTP) from bovine liver was used to retailor the molecular species composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the membrane of normal (AA) and sickleable (SS) human erythrocytes. Changes in molecular species composition of PC altered morphology as well as cellular deformability and stability as measured with ektacytometry. In normal cells, replacement of native PC with 1-palmitoyl,2-arachidonoyl PC (PAPC) resulted in a decrease in osmotic fragility with no change in hydration, whereas replacement with 1,2-dipalmitoyl PC (DPPC) led to an increased osmotic fragility and cellular hydration. Replacement of native PC by 1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl PC (POPC) in normal cells had no apparent effect on these parameters. In contrast, replacement of native PC in sickle cells with either PAPC, DPPC or POPC led to cellular hydration. Facilitation of PC exchange between subpopulations of SS cells separated on buoyant density also led to cellular hydration. These observations suggest that the state of hydration of sickle cells can be modified by the fatty acyl composition of PC and illustrate a a role for the lipid core in the observed permeability changes in sickle erythrocytes. They also raise the interesting possibility that the state of cellular hydration of sickle cells may be modulated by altering the molecular species composition of the membrane phospholipids.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evidence that microenvironmental factors account for the age-related decline in neutrophil function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We measured the function of neutrophils harvested from the supernatant of long-term marrow cultures in which stromal cell cultures derived from young mice were recharged with hematopoietic cells from old mice and vice versa. The functions measured were superoxide generation and enzyme secretion (lysozyme and glucuronidase), following cell activation by either phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or Formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). In addition we measured cytosolic calcium concentration and its increase following activation by FMLP. In all culture combinations recharge resulted in the recovery of greater than 2 X 10(6) cells/flask (95% neutrophils, 98% viable). Histologic studies of cytoplasmic markers indicated that recovered neutrophils were derived from the stem cell population employed for recharge. For each neutrophil parameter measured, function was markedly improved when old hematopoietic stem cells were recharged onto a young stroma and was significantly diminished when young stem cells were recharged onto an old stroma. This applied to superoxide generation, basal and stimulated enzyme levels, and to basal cytosolic calcium concentration and its increase following activation by FMLP. These results indicate that when old hematopoietic stem cells proliferate in a young microenvironment, neutrophil function returns virtually to normal. Conversely, function diminishes when young stem cells proliferate in an old stroma. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that neutrophil function is modulated by microenvironmental factors, hormonal, cellular, or matrix, which are decreased in the elderly. That an age-related decline in function is extrinsic to the cell and is reversible has significance for the study of neutrophil function and of cellular aging and has potential therapeutic implications.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adenosine dialdehyde and nitrous oxide induce HL-60 differentiation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Adenosine dialdehyde and nitrous oxide, specific S-adeno-sylhomocysteine hydrolase and methionine synthetase inhibitors, respectively, induced differentiation of the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Their effect did not appear to be mediated through changes in transmethylation or decreased S-adenosylmethionine synthesis because (1) there was little correlation between the concentrations of adenosine dialdehyde that induced differentiation and those that changed the ratio of the intracellular concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine, and (2) inhibition of methionine adenosyltransferase by cycloleucine did not induce differentiation. The differentiation induced by adenosine dialdehyde was prevented by homocysteine and that by nitrous oxide was inversely related to the medium methionine concentration. This suggested that differentiation was secondary to decreased methionine synthesis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chloramphenicol-induced bone marrow injury: possible role of bacterial metabolites of chloramphenicol.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To explore the potential role of some bacterial metabolites of chloramphenicol (CAP) in CAP-induced hematotoxicity, we examined their cytotoxic effects on bone marrow cells in vitro using a number of cytotoxicity parameters. Among the metabolites tested, dehydro-CAP (DHCAP) and p-nitrophenyl-2-amino-3 hydroxypropanone-HCI (NPAP) were more toxic than CAP. DHCAP was at least as toxic as nitroso-CAP. At concentrations of less than or equal to 10(-4) mol/L, DHCAP caused total irreversible inhibition of myeloid colony (CFU-GM) growth and 80% inhibition of DNA synthesis in human bone marrow. Incubation of human bone marrow cells with 10(-4) mol/L nitroso-CAP or DHCAP for 24 hours resulted in 75% and 65% cell death respectively. Although DHCAP was 10- to 20-fold more cytotoxic than CAP, it was only one third as effective in inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis, indicating that DHCAP exerts its toxic effect by alternate mechanisms. The cytotoxicity of DHCAP and its relative stability, compared to the unstable nitroso CAP, suggest that this bacterial metabolite of CAP, and possibly others, may play a significant role in CAP-induced hematotoxicity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Histone H1 degrees is synthesized by human lymphocytic leukemia cells but not by normal lymphocytes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system (sodium dodecyl sulphate/acetic acid-urea-hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) coupled with fluorography, we investigated the synthesis of H1 isoproteins in leukemic cells obtained from peripheral blood of eight children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (four T-ALL, three common ALL, and one B-ALL) and in normal peripheral lymphocytes. H1 degrees was synthesized in leukemic cells but not in normal lymphocytes. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with hydroxyurea and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine induced an increase of relative synthesis of H1 degrees in leukemic cells but did not induce any detectable synthesis of H1 degrees in normal lymphocytes. H1 degrees synthesis was also undetectable in peripheral lymphocytes of leukemic children in complete remission after chemotherapy and in lymphocytes of a homozygotic twin of a leukemic patient. H1 degrees may be a marker of malignant transformation of lymphocytes and as such could be of use for early detection of relapse in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia in apparent complete remission.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acquisition of formyl peptide receptors during normal human myeloid differentiation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- By using a newly developed immune rosetting technique to isolate highly purified populations of myeloid precursor cells from normal human bone marrow and then inducing their differentiation with granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G/M-CSFs) in vitro, we studied the surface expression of chemotactic peptide receptors as the cells matured from the stage of the myeloblast to that of the mature, segmented neutrophil. We used ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) to link N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-[125I]iodo-Tyr-Lys to chemotactic peptide receptors on the surface of myeloid cells at sequential stages of maturation and then determined the density of receptor-radioligand complexes by autoradiography after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Specific, saturable formyl peptide receptors were not detectable at the level of the myeloblast but gradually emerged through progressive stages of neutrophil maturation. The specific receptors for formyl peptide that appeared during cellular maturation had a mol wt of 55 to 70 kiloDalton (kD), corresponding to those present on the surface of peripheral blood neutrophils, and binding of the radioligand was highly specific in that it was completely inhibited by a 1,000-fold excess of F-Met Leu Phe. These data correlate with and provide insight into our recent observation that F-Met Leu Phe-induced membrane depolarization and transient increases in cytosolic free calcium are gradually acquired as neutrophils mature. This report represents to our knowledge the first description of the maturational development of chemotactic peptide receptor expression in normal human myeloid cells.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Genetic differences in hemoglobin influence on erythrocyte oxidative stress hemolysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The RBC from mice of certain inbred strains hemolyzed under oxidative stress (2.0 mmol/L hydrogen peroxide), whereas red cells from mice of other strains did not. In the experimental system human erythrocytes did not hemolyze. The rate of formation of malonyldialdehyde (a fatty acid oxidative breakdown product) was fourfold higher in hemolytic v nonhemolytic red cells. There was insufficient variation in the levels of glutathione, peroxidase activity or its substrate, reduced glutathione, to explain these hemolysis differences. On the other hand, the antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole and hydroxytoluene, and histidine protected the hemolysis-prone red cells from breaking open. The hemolysis trait demonstrated autosomal recessive Mendelian inheritance. When using inbred, recombinant inbred, and congenic inbred mice, this hemolysis/nonhemolysis trait correlated 1:1 with the type of hemoglobin beta chain in the RBC. This experimental system is a potential model for investigating the role of hemoglobin in prehemolytic events.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A unique 7p/12q chromosomal abnormality associated with recurrent abortion and hypofibrinogenemia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Recurrent first trimester abortions led to evaluation of a 25-year-old woman. Studies revealed she had hypofibrinogenemia (68 mg/dL) without evidence of dysfibrinogenemia or increased fibrinogen turnover. She was also found to have a unique 46,XX, t(7;12) (p 15.2;q24.31) karyotype. Hypofibrinogenemia and identical chromosomal abnormalities were found in other members of her kindred. Southern blots of genomic DNA from the patient, her mother, and her daughter hybridized to human fibrinogen probes showed alpha, beta, and gamma fibrinogen genes to be present and without structural alterations when compared to normal controls. We conclude that the chromosomal abnormality and the hypofibrinogenemia are related but in an unclear manner. Because fibrinogen infusion in the proposita was associated with successful gestation, we also concluded that the chromosomal abnormality itself was not responsible for the repeated abortions but that fibrinogen concentration may be critical in securing implantation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Neural control of internal anal sphincter function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect on anal tone of electrical stimulation of the presacral (hypogastric) sympathetic nerves has been studied in eight patients during abdominal rectopexy or restorative proctocolectomy. A sharp fall in anal pressure occurred in seven patients (mean fall 59 cmH2O; range 35-80 cmH2O). In one patient given a beta- and alpha-sympathetic blocking drug (labetalol 200 mg) intra-operatively, the anal pressure decreased by 15 cmH2O. These observations show that stimulation of the presacral sympathetic nerves causes relaxation of the internal anal sphincter and implies that these nerves may induce relaxation of the sphincter in vivo. The pathway of the recto-anal reflex has been studied intra-operatively in three patients undergoing rectal excision. The recto-anal reflex is present after presacral nerve blockade and after full mobilization of the rectum, but is abolished by circumferential rectal myotomy. The reflex has a local intramural pathway. This observation validates the assumption that absence of this reflex is a feature of aganglionosis, as in Hirschsprung's disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Results of proctocolectomy for Crohn's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seventy-four patients have had a one-stage proctocolectomy for the management of Crohn's disease. Indications for operation were: acute colitis 28 per cent, chronic colitis 39 per cent, perianal disease 13 per cent, proctitis and perianal disease 8 per cent, bleeding 5 per cent, coexisting colonic malignancy 7 per cent. There were two hospital deaths (2.7 per cent), both associated with sepsis. Late deaths (n = 13) were most commonly associated with reoperations for recurrent disease (n = 3), cardiovascular disease (n = 4) and colorectal carcinoma (n = 1). Postoperative complications were principally associated with sepsis. Cumulative reoperation rates at 5 and 10 years were 19 and 24 per cent respectively. Recurrence was unrelated to the age of the patients, the duration of disease, or the presence of ileal disease at the time of colectomy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Unaltered risk of colorectal cancer within 14-17 years of cholecystectomy: updating of a population-based cohort study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The incidence of colorectal cancer after cholecystectomy was analysed in a historical population-based cohort study comprising 16,439 patients who were completely followed up for 14-17 years after operation. The observed number of colorectal cancers (150) was lower than the expected number of 166.3 (relative risk (RR) = 0.90:95 per cent confidence limits 0.77-1.05) and the overall risk for colon cancer (RR = 0.95) did not differ significantly from that of rectal cancer (RR = 0.82). Separate analyses by sex, age at operation and duration of follow-up revealed relative risks close to or lower than unity. Some deviations indicating a substantially reduced risk might have been due to the play of chance alone. Our results contradict the idea both of a causal and of a non-causal association-through common aetiological factors-between surgically confirmed gallbladder disease and colorectal cancer.</ABSTRACT>

- Case notes of 250 patients (M:F, 1:2.7; age 48.7 +/- 16.5 years) in whom anterior mucosal prolapse had been diagnosed, at one hospital between 1974 and 1976, were reviewed. The commonest symptoms were bleeding (56 per cent), pain (32 per cent) and a sense of prolapse (32 per cent). The prevalence of constipation was significantly higher among women (47 per cent) than men (29 per cent). Perineal descent was present in 20 per cent of cases and was significantly more frequently associated with excessive straining at defaecation (28 per cent) compared with patients in whom there was no history of excessive straining (12 per cent). Sixty-six patients (26 per cent) experienced recurring symptoms over the 10 year period following presentation but did not deteriorate, while 28 patients (11 per cent) deteriorated. Deterioration was associated with a history of symptoms for longer than 1 year at the time of presentation, female sex, and the presence of perineal descent on clinical examination. The risk of developing perineal descent was less than 10 per cent over the 5 years after presentation while that of developing sphincter laxity among patients who had already developed perineal descent was 30 per cent over this period. Complete rectal prolapse occurred in 20 per cent (3/15) of patients with clinical perineal descent and sphincter laxity but was not seen in the absence of these signs. The results of treatment by submucosal phenol injection, mucosal rubber banding, or glycerine suppositories were the same.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Implantation of a pressure cuff around the subphrenic oesophagus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The possibility of implanting a pressure cuff around the subphrenic oesophagus as a barrier to reflux was tested in six pigs. The oesophagus tolerated cuff pressures from 48 to 95 cmH2O, corresponding to intra-oesophageal pressures from 27 to 75 cmH2O. The pigs with the perioesophageal cuff swallowed a solid diet without difficulty. However, dysphagia occurred in pigs kept alive for more than a month and the main reason was malfunction of the device because of surrounding fibrosis. This problem should be solved before implantation of the device in humans is attempted.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Criteria for diffuse oesophageal spasm(DOS) are dysphagia and chest pain with oesophageal manometry showing retention of peristalsis with the presence of synchronous contractions in response to wet swallows. Because of the intermittent nature of the symptoms, edrophonium was used as a provocative agent to increase diagnostic yield. Three hundred and ninety-six patients underwent transnasal manometry using a Gaeltec system of six internal transducers arranged at 5 cm intervals from the catheter tip; the majority of these patients received 10 mg edrophonium as an intravenous bolus. Reproduction of symptoms with typical manometry of DOS indicated a positive provocation test. There were no significant side effects. DOS was diagnosed in 34 patients who had either the typical manometry or a positive provocation test. Thirty of these patients received edrophonium. Twenty patients had baseline manometry which was diagnostic and ten of this group had a positive provocation test. The remaining 10 patients, who had normal baseline manometry, had positive provocation tests following the injection of edrophonium. Without edrophonium provocation testing, about a third of patients would not have been diagnosed as having DOS.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty cases of intussusception in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years were compared with intussusception in infancy and early childhood. They accounted for 18.5 per cent of all 108 children treated for intussusception in two large hospitals from 1964 to 1984. Diagnosis of intussusception was delayed, probably due to an unusual presentation. Fifty-five per cent had a definite predisposing factor precipitating the intussusception and 45 per cent had a small bowel intussusception, which warranted early surgical intervention. In the absence of contraindications no child should be disqualified from an attempt at hydrostatic reduction. After hydrostatic reduction careful follow-up is required to exclude an organic lesion, possibly by a small bowel follow-through meal. Surgery is indicated after hydrostatic reduction in case of chronically recurrent abdominal complaints.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of computed tomography in selecting patients for hindquarter amputation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Nine patients with soft tissue sarcomas close to the pelvic girdle and one patient with a primary malignant bone tumour of the pelvis were referred for consideration of hindquarter amputation. Patients were considered unsuitable for hindquarter amputation on clinical grounds if malignant disease infiltrated into the perineum or across the sacro-iliac joint. If disease in the femoral triangle extended above the inguinal ligament the tumour's operability was seriously questioned. Buttock tumours which had passed through the greater sciatic notch to become palpable on pelvic examination were also considered likely to be inoperable. On computed tomographic (CT) examination, tumours were considered inoperable if the psoas muscle was involved above the inguinal ligament, or if malignant disease involved the sacro-iliac joint, sacrum or perineal structures. Soft tissue tumours of the buttock extending significantly through the greater sciatic notch were also considered likely to be inoperable. Five patients thought suitable for hindquarter amputation on clinical assessment had no excluding features on CT; four undergoing hindquarter amputation were proven on histological examination to have good clearance of their tumours. In another patient, considered suitable for hindquarter amputation on clinical grounds, CT suggested that en bloc wide excision of the tumour was feasible enabling the affected limb to be preserved. Four patients after clinical examination were considered unsuitable for hindquarter amputation and in all cases inoperability was confirmed by CT. CT complements clinical examination and provides an objective and reliable means of selecting patients for hindquarter amputation which should avoid unnecessary surgical exploration.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- This is a retrospective review of 328 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma diagnosed in one centre between 1974 and 1984. Of these patients, 128 (39 per cent) had a curative resection, 32 (9.8 per cent) had a palliative resection, 33 (10.0 per cent) had a gastro-enterostomy, 26 (7.9 per cent) had a Celestin tube inserted, 58 (17.7 per cent) had a laparotomy alone, and 51 (15.5 per cent) had no surgical procedure. The 5 year survival was 11 per cent but all long term survivors were patients who had a curative resection. Using multivariate analysis the best predictor of survival after curative resection was the presence or absence of serosal involvement (P = 0.0004). Patients with a long history of presenting symptoms (greater than 6 months) survived longer than those with a short history (P = 0.001). The impact of chemotherapy on the survival of 202 patients with advanced gastric cancer was analysed by multivariate analysis. The median survival of the 50 patients receiving combination chemotherapy was better than that of the 152 who did not (median survivals 160 versus 71 days; P less than 0.001). When deaths occurring within 14 days of diagnosis were excluded, the significance value dropped to P = 0.02. Comparison of the groups treated between 1974 and 1979, when 8 per cent of 92 patients received chemotherapy, with 1980-1984, when 45 per cent of 110 patients received chemotherapy, showed no significant difference in survival.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Relative contribution of bile and pancreatic juice duodenogastric reflux in gastric ulcer disease and cholelithiasis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Bile acid concentrations, phospholipase A2 activity and pH in the stomach were measured in the fasting state and for 2 h after a fat-containing test meal in patients with an active gastric ulcer (GU), in patients with gallstones before and after cholecystectomy and in normal subjects. Fasting and peak postprandial bile acid concentrations in the stomach were low in all normal controls. Although high concentrations were found in many patients with GU (P less than 0.01), similar concentrations were found in many patients with radiologically non-functioning gallbladders containing gallstones (NFG) (P less than 0.01) and also after cholecystectomy (AC) (P less than 0.01). Fasting intragastric phospholipase A2 activities were similar, and very high in GU and NFG patients compared with control subjects (P less than 0.01). High values were not found after cholecystectomy. There was no difference in pH profile or in postprandial phospholipase A2 between patient groups. Since patients with cholelithiasis or after cholecystectomy are not known to have an increased incidence of gastric ulceration, the significance of duodenogastric reflux in the aetiology of gastric ulcers must be questioned. If reflux does produce ulcers in GU patients then factors in addition to bile acid are probably involved. However, neither patterns of phospholipase A2 reflux nor pH profiles can explain the absence of gastric ulceration in those patients with gallstones who reflux large quantities of bile acid.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Since 1983, percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy has been performed in 50 patients for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy was used to evaluate the nature of obstructive jaundice in 15 patients and bile duct stones were removed in 35 patients, 27 of whom also had intrahepatic duct stones. The overall success rate for stone removal was 80 per cent. Complications were few with no mortality. Emergency surgery was necessary in two patients, one for subphrenic haematoma, the other for a bile leak. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy is an effective and safe method for management of biliary stones and is a useful procedure for establishing the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Suture materials in contaminated wounds: a detailed comparison of a new suture with those currently in use.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relationship between five different suture materials (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polypropylene, polyglycolic acid, polydioxanone and polyglactin 910) and infection has been studied in 540 guinea-pig wounds contaminated with synergistic enteric organisms. The recently introduced expanded PTFE suture has been studied because, unlike the others, it has not previously been studied under these contaminated conditions. The incidence of wound infection in the control series was 26 per cent and all suture materials increased this figure significantly. The infection rate using expanded PTFE of 51 per cent was similar to all other sutures except polyglycolic acid, which produced an infection rate of 41 per cent. This difference was not statistically significant at the 5 per cent level. This confirms other studies including our own which show that the presence of most suture materials in contaminated wounds increases the incidence of infection. It further demonstrates that expanded PTFE is no different from other materials in this regard.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- An evaluation was made of the histological material obtained from all 1529 appendices removed during the last 5 years at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, in order to elucidate possible relationships between the incidence of Enterobius vermicularis and the origin of inflammation in the appendix. In total, 1419 appendices were removed as cases of clinical appendicitis and 110 in the course of another surgical procedure. E. vermicularis was identified in 2.7 per cent of patients with clinical appendicitis and was most commonly seen in appendices with either chronic inflammation or where the appendix was histologically normal. E. vermicularis was rarely associated with histological changes of acute appendicitis. No cases of E. vermicularis infestation occurred in appendices removed during the course of other surgical procedures. The results suggest that, although E. vermicularis may have a causal role in appendicular pain and chronic inflammation, it is rarely related to acute appendicitis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of the local and systemic effects of sepsis in predicting survival.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Progress in the study of sepsis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable system for grading its severity. Systems suggested for scoring sepsis have been based either on its systemic effects (APACHE II) or on a mixture of local and systemic variables (sepsis score). The APACHE II and sepsis scores were applied to patients with intra-abdominal sepsis of more than 3 days' duration, to determine if local or systemic factors were more important in predicting survival. Of 45 patients studied, 14 died. The sepsis score for non-survivors (median 21.5, range 11-32) was significantly higher than for survivors (median 14, range 10-26, P less than 0.05). There was overlap between the two groups, such that an individual score had no predictive value. The local component of the sepsis score was not significantly increased in non-survivors (P less than 0.05), but the systemic component was (P less than 0.05). The APACHE II score for non-survivors (median 24, range 15-38) was significantly higher than for survivors (median 12, range 3-21), and correctly identified 13 of the 14 fatalities. Both the systemic and non-systemic components (age and chronic disease) were significantly higher among the latter. The APACHE II was more effective than the sepsis score in predicting survival. We conclude that any system used for scoring sepsis should be based on systemic rather than local effects. At present the APACHE II score is preferred.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Salvage autotransfusion in aortic surgery: initial studies using a disposable reservoir.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Transmission of disease by allogeneic transfusion can be avoided using several techniques by which a patient receives his own blood. Sixty patients undergoing aortic surgery consented to salvage interoperative autotransfusion. A mean of 895 ml shed blood was reinfused under full heparinization, representing 12-74 per cent of total blood loss. Bank blood requirements fell from 4.9 units to 3.4. No important haematological or clinical complications were noted (including coagulation studies) but haemolysis was detected 4 h postoperatively by plasma haemoglobin levels of 0.05 +/- 0.03 g/dl. This preliminary study confirms the applicability of salvage autotransfusion during elective vascular surgery by demonstrating an appreciable saving in bank blood transfusion (70 per cent).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hyperexcitability of cutaneous afferents during the supernormal period. Relevance to paraesthesiae.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The excitability of cutaneous afferents in the median nerve of 20 normal human subjects was investigated using a supramaximal conditioning stimulus and a submaximal test stimulus that produced an afferent volley of 20 to 40% of maximum. The intensity of the test stimuli was 1.1 to 1.25 times threshold for the first recruited axons (defined as a compound action potential of approximately 0.5 microV). The amplitude of the test volley did not reach the control amplitude until conditioning-test intervals of 3.4 ms. This was followed by a period of increased axonal excitability which reached a peak at intervals of 5 to 8 ms and declined gradually into a late phase of subnormality at 15 to 20 ms. The amplitude of the submaximal test potential was potentiated by, on average, 47% (range 9-146%) during the supernormal period. There were no significant changes in latency. The time course and the degree of potentiation were reproducible in the same subject on separate occasions. When the limb was cooled, the latency of the onset of supernormality was increased and the degree of supernormality was decreased and ultimately abolished. There was an inverse relationship between the degree of potentiation and the size of the test volley. High-frequency repetitive stimulation of the digital nerves for 10 min modified axonal excitability and produced spontaneous paraesthesiae that lasted for 20 min after the stimulation. Following this prolonged stimulus train, single submaximal stimuli evoked larger cutaneous afferent potentials than before the train, and the extent of the potentiation during the supernormal period was increased. It is concluded that prolonged repetitive stimulation of cutaneous afferents has two effects, one on axonal threshold, the second on the supernormal period. It is suggested that, in this experimental model, paraesthesiae result from ectopic impulses generated when axonal excitability is highest, namely at the peak of the supernormal period.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Labial kinematics during speech in patients with parkinsonian rigidity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Studies of orofacial motor control in Parkinson's disease (PD) have demonstrated that these subjects may exhibit hypokinesia and bradykinesia, as well as increased muscle tone. Yet the relationship between aberrations of orofacial movement and muscle rigidity remains unclear. Measures of labial muscle rigidity and movement were made for 12 parkinsonian and 9 age-matched control subjects. Displacement amplitude, peak instantaneous velocity, and movement time were evaluated during repetitive syllable productions. The results showed that while mean parkinsonian displacement amplitudes and velocities were lower than the normal control subjects, there was no statistical relationship between labial rigidity and the degree of movement abnormality. It is concluded that while rigidity may play a part in the overall disability, it does not sufficiently explain the labial articulatory difficulties associated with parkinsonism. This is in agreement with the literature on limb rigidity and movement aberrations in PD, suggesting that rigidity and bradykinesia may represent independent pathophysiological phenomena.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of cortical and subcortical lesions in the production of poststroke mood disorders.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Patients with single stroke lesions, verified by computerized tomography, involving either cortical tissue or restricted entirely to subcortical structures were examined for mood disorders. Those with left anterior lesions, either cortical or subcortical, had significantly greater frequency and severity of depression than patients with any other lesion location. A strong correlation between the severity of depression and proximity of the lesion to the frontal pole was observed for both left cortical and subcortical groups. Right hemisphere lesions did not show the same correlation with depression but were associated with a significantly higher incidence of undue cheerfulness. These findings demonstrate the importance of the location of subcortical lesions in poststroke mood disorders and suggest that anterior subcortical structures may play an important but lateralized role in the production or regulation of mood.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The slow channel syndrome. Two new cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two patients are described with a myasthenic syndrome that presented in early adult life. One patient had 2 asymptomatic first degree relatives with similar electrophysiological findings. Both patients had abnormal fatiguability, arm weakness being prominent; neither of them responded to anticholinesterase medication. An abnormal decrement at 3 Hz stimulation was present, and a single stimulus evoked a repetitive response. Electrophysiological studies on biopsied intercostal muscle showed miniature endplate potentials of normal amplitudes but with prolonged rise and decay times. Anticholinesterase staining (Case 1) was not reduced, and showed elongation of some endplates. Ultrastructural studies (Case 2) showed degeneration of junctional folds and diffusely thickened endplate basal lamina. Calcium deposits were not observed and myopathic changes were slight. The findings are consistent with a prolonged open time of the ACh-induced ion channel.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Critical illness polyneuropathy. A complication of sepsis and multiple organ failure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Nineteen patients developed polyneuropathy complicating critical illness. They had been admitted to a critical care unit following intubation for cardiac or pulmonary disease and had developed sepsis and multiple organ failure. Approximately one month following intubation, failure to wean from the ventilator and limb weakness prompted neurological referral. Examination disclosed weakness and wasting of muscles and impaired tendon reflexes in most, but not all, patients. Electrophysiological studies in 17 patients revealed attenuated compound muscle and sensory nerve action potential amplitudes and widespread denervation on needle electromyography. Autopsy in 9 patients who died of their critical illness revealed widespread primary axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibres, with extensive denervation atrophy of limb and respiratory muscles. Survivors recovered from the polyneuropathy three to six months following discharge. Seventeen of the patients were segregated by electrophysiological criteria into mild (8) and severe (9) polyneuropathy categories. An analysis of these two groups failed to reveal putative metabolic, drug, nutritional or toxic factors that might be responsible for the polyneuropathy. Our studies suggest that the mechanism may be a fundamental defect, still unknown, which causes dysfunction of all organ systems in this syndrome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Among 65 patients with necrotizing vasculitis, 45 had systemic and 20 had nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy. In nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy, clinically only nerves are affected; there are no, or few, constitutional symptoms or serological abnormalities. The clinical and pathological features are those of an ischaemic neuropathy caused by a necrotizing vasculitis of small arterioles. These 20 patients had neuropathic symptoms for a median time of 11.5 yrs (range 1-35 yrs). The clinical pattern of neuropathy was that of multiple mononeuropathy in 13, asymmetric neuropathy in 4, distal polyneuropathy in 3, and sensory polyneuropathy in 1. As compared with their initial evaluation, 8 are now worse, 5 are better, 4 are approximately the same, and 3 are dead from unrelated causes. Prednisone was thought to prevent the development of new lesions in some cases. By contrast, of the 41 patients with systemic necrotizing vasculitis whose outcome is known, 12 are dead (median time, 1.5 yrs, range 3 months-8 yrs) and 29 are alive (median time, 6 yrs, range 6 months-22 yrs).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Encephalopathy and myelinolysis after rapid correction of hyponatraemia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Considerable controversy has followed the recent publication of studies indicating that central pontine myelinolysis is caused by rapid correction of hyponatraemia. Alternative suggestions have been that myelinolysis is due to uncorrected hyponatraemia, that it occurs only with over-correction of hyponatraemia or that it is due to coincidental hypoxia. The following experiments were undertaken to clarify the relationship between myelinolysis and derangements of serum sodium and their treatment. Severe hyponatraemia ([Na+] less than or equal to 122 mmol/l) was produced in three groups of rabbits by injection of vasopressin and 5% dextrose in water. Rabbits with severe uncorrected hyponatraemia sustained for seven days or more did not show myelinolysis at autopsy. Myelinolytic lesions did develop in 3 of 7 rabbits in a second group in which corrective infusion of hypertonic saline was administered after only three days of severe hyponatraemia. Neurological deterioration also occurred in rabbits in the third group which received hypertonic saline within 24h of developing severe hyponatraemia. In this group no lesions were apparent at autopsy. No animal became hypernatraemic with correction. These results indicate that even prolonged severe hyponatraemia does not lead to myelinolysis if it remains uncorrected, but that rapid correction of hyponatraemia, without over-correction, can cause neurological disease. Accordingly, a rapid rise in serum sodium should be avoided.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chromaticity and achromaticity. Evidence for a functional differentiation in visual field defects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In the visual field defects of 10 patients who had suffered lesions in the postgeniculate part of the primary visual projection, red-green discrimination and achromatic target detection was tested. In addition, 8 of these patients were tested for detection of red and green targets. Targets were presented on a low photopic achromatic background, so that the red and green targets differed from the background both in intensity and in wavelength, whereas the achromatic target differed in intensity only. Six patients showed evidence of discriminating between red and green targets, 5 patients could also detect the colour targets, but none could detect the achromatic one that was presented at the same retinal position. These results imply that wavelength and intensity information are treated differentially, and suggest that these patients possess residual colour-opponent channels that subserve the defective part of the visual field.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Residual vision in patients with retrogeniculate lesions of the visual pathways.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-five subjects have been studied who, as a result of damage to the striate cortex, were 'blind' in extensive areas (scotomata) of the visual fields. Of these 25 subjects, 5 exhibited residual vision in response to transient lights presented within the scotoma, which enabled them to locate the stimuli by hand-reaching or by eye movements; the latter have been measured by electro-oculography. The residual vision underlying their responses was characterized by low flicker-fusion and by sensitivity in detection of movement which increased as target speed was raised. Discrimination for the direction of target movement was poor, but spatial resolution in the discrimination of target displacement was essentially normal. The subjects were unable to recognize or discriminate the spatial structure of targets located within the 'blind' field, and the observed dissociation between spatial discrimination of displacement and pattern is examined in relation to the 'two systems' hypothesis of visual function. There is no obvious correlation between the extent of neuronal damage as revealed by CT scans and the existence of residual vision.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A study of viral genomes and antigens in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The presence of viral nucleic acid sequences and antigens from a variety of conventional viruses in selected brain regions of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), diagnosed pathologically, was investigated using molecular hybridization and immunocytochemical techniques. Seven DNA and 4 RNA viruses were used as probes in 18 AD and 5 control brains. With Southern blot hybridization, no viral DNA sequences could be detected in the cerebral cortex. With dot blot hybridization, results were also negative, except for 2 cases, 1 a control brain, the other an AD brain, which gave a positive signal in the RNA extracted from the substantia innominata when c-DNA from measles virus was used as a probe. Four specific brain areas from each of 8 AD brains and 5 controls tested with viral probes (3 DNA and 5 RNA viruses), using immunocytochemical techniques for viral antigens, showed no positive reproducible specific reactions. These results, although negative, do not totally exclude the possibility that conventional viruses may play a role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of AD.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Focal ischaemia caused by instability of cerebrovascular tone during attacks of hemiplegic migraine. A regional cerebral blood flow study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During the course of hemiplegic migraine in 3 patients, changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were recorded by the intracarotid 133Xe method and a 254 multidetector camera covering one hemisphere. The rCBF measurements were performed in conjunction with cerebral angiography. During repeated rCBF measurements all 3 patients developed focal hypoperfusion originating in the frontal lobe, subsequently spreading posteriorly to involve the precentral and postcentral regions. In 2 cases focal hyperperfusion appeared to precede the hypoperfusion. In association with the rCBF changes the patients developed transient motor and/or sensory deficits and subsequently severe headache. No signs of arterial occlusion were found. In the over and underperfused regions blood flow fluctuated rapidly because of instability of cerebrovascular tone, defined as transient constriction of the smallest cerebral vessels (arterioles) alternating with a normal calibre for these vessels and/or short periods of vasodilatation. It is considered to be a primary pathological condition of the vessels. When vasoconstriction was present the blood flow decreased to values consistent with ischaemia, which was probably the cause of the neurological deficits. On the basis of these observations and previous work from our laboratory we conclude that instability of cerebrovascular tone may cause focal ischaemia during the course of attacks of classical and hemiplegic migraine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Disordered auditory short-term memory in man and event-related potentials.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four patients with conduction aphasia and impaired auditory but relatively preserved visual digit spans were tested in a task of short-term memory, a digit probe identification task, in both the visual and auditory modalities. Five age-matched normal subjects served as controls. Behavioural measures of response accuracy and reaction time and scalp derived event-related potentials were determined as a function of the number of items to be remembered. These measures were also recorded in a task requiring the detection of infrequent stimuli ('oddball' paradigm). The patients' performance and event-related potential wave forms for the 'oddball' task were no different from those of the controls. In the digit probe identification tasks the patients showed a reduction in amplitude of a positive component at a latency of approximately 450 ms (P450) of the event-related potential to correctly identified probes in the auditory modality. This component was within normal limits with visual testing. There was an inordinate increase in the patients' reaction time to auditory but not visual stimuli when the number of items to be remembered increased from one to three. Event-related potentials were also analysed as a function of speed of reaction time, position of the matching item in the stimulus presentation set and whether the probe was correctly identified as being in-set or out-of-set. Event-related potentials associated with fast reaction times in the auditory task when a single item was presented were no different between patients and controls, indicating that patients were capable of both performing normally and generating normal potentials on some trials. The data suggest that the deficit in auditory short-term memory in these patients occurs during stimulus classification.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Correlations of subcortical CT lesion sites and aphasia profiles.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have analysed the aphasia profiles of 19 cases with subcortical infarction or haemorrhage. Several components of the aphasic syndromes, especially sentence length and grammatical form (together compromising fluency), ease of speech initiation, articulation, voice volume, and auditory comprehension, were individually isolated for correlation with CT lesion site. Each component had a specific lesion site correlation, and lesions in various deep periventricular white matter regions were the critical ones for all components of aphasia. Simple tabulation of lesions as cortical or subcortical, and restricting analysis to lesions of basal ganglia would both have proved inadequate to account for clinical findings. A review of 61 subcortical cases in the neurological literature for which CT and aphasia data were available supports these conclusions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adult onset Hallervorden-Spatz disease with neurofibrillary pathology. A discrete clinicopathological entity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three adults with progressive cognitive decline and extrapyramidal dysfunction were studied. They were all mentally retarded women without known chromosomal abnormalities, ranging in age at the time of onset from 31 to 42 yrs with an average duration of illness of 6 yrs. Neurological signs were stereotyped and consisted of a unilateral equinovarus foot posture followed by progressive dementia, rigidity and quadriparesis. Identical pathological findings were noted in all cases. There was marked deposition of iron-containing pigments in the globus pallidus and reticulate zone of the substantia nigra. Numerous axonal spheroids were noted in these areas and in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. In addition to these typical changes of Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD), abundant neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were found within the hippocampus, neocortex, nuclei of basal forebrain, subthalamic nucleus and brainstem reticular formation. Rare Hirano bodies and granulovacuolar degeneration were noted within the hippocampus; neuritic plaques and amyloid deposits were absent. Ultrastructurally the NFTs were mostly paired helical filaments (PHFs) with a diameter of 20 to 25 nm and a half-periodicity of 80 nm. Straight filaments and incompletely twisted forms were also seen. Immunocytochemistry with polyclonal antibodies to PHFs was positive in a distribution identical to that of Bodian-positive NFTs. Biochemical analysis of frozen frontal cortex from 1 case revealed a 94% depletion of the cholinergic marker enzyme choline acetyltransferase. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was within normal range. Study of 1 case with laser microprobe mass analysis revealed evidence of aluminium accumulation in tangle-bearing hippocampal neurons. Adjacent tangle-free neurons failed to show comparable accumulations. These findings indicate that adult onset HSD occurring in mentally retarded individuals may represent a distinct clinicopathological entity associated with neurofibrillary pathology without amyloid deposition.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation on competence and patient outcome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1981 and 1985 we carried out a study in two medium-sized nonteaching community hospitals to determine the rate of deterioration of knowledge and skills in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among physicians and nurses, the accuracy of their perceptions of their knowledge and skills, the effects of practice on retention and the effect of CPR training on mortality. The participants' knowledge and skills were measured before training and immediately after, 6 months after and 12 months after training. Information on all attempts at CPR involving hospital staff was collected from medical records and from interviews with the participants. A total of 31 physicians and 54 nurses were followed during the study. Six months after training there was no difference in CPR knowledge or skills between the physicians and the nurses. In both groups CPR skills had deteriorated to near pretraining levels. By 6 months the physicians' knowledge had deteriorated to a level not significantly different from that before training. The nurses maintained a significant improvement in knowledge test scores at 12 months over those before training (p = 0.037). The physicians had an accurate perception of their knowledge but not their skills 6 months and 12 months after training, whereas the nurses did not accurately perceive either their knowledge or their skills after training. Experience with CPR did not contribute to post-training knowledge or skills in either group. There was no evidence that death rates were lower when basic life support (BLS) was begun by trained staff than when it was begun by untrained staff. The probability of survival was greater when BLS was begun within 4 minutes of arrest than when it was begun after 4 minutes, regardless of whether advanced cardiac life support was begun within 10 minutes.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We reviewed the records for 100 consecutive cases of elective hip replacement in 91 patients in their 80s (average age 82.8 years), all of whom lived in their own homes before surgery. In 92 cases the patients returned home, 59 within 3 weeks. The average duration of hospital stay was 20.1 days. In eight cases there were major complications, including three cases of myocardial infarction (one of them fatal) and two cases of pulmonary embolism (one of them fatal). In 15 cases there were moderate complications, including deep venous thrombosis (in 5) and urinary tract complications necessitating transurethral prostatectomy (in 2). In 44 cases there were minor complications, including the need for urinary catheterization (in 27) and brief periods of postoperative confusion (in 14). In 33 cases there were no complications; in 31 of these cases the patients returned directly home within 3 weeks. The preoperative risk rating of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) correlated well with the complication rates: the rates of major complications in cases with a rating of ASA class I, II or III were 0%, 6% and 15% respectively. In 49 of 52 cases in which the procedure had been performed more than 2 years previously, the patients were happy they had had the operation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Continuing education through Telemedicine for Ontario.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Telemedicine for Ontario (TFO) is a continuing education program for health professionals. It is an interactive audio system, organized and operated by the five provincial medical schools, that is designed to offer otherwise unavailable educational programs to health professionals in northern or other isolated areas of Ontario. TFO has provided programs in three categories--medicine, nursing and allied health--and has covered a wide range of topics; the programs have been tailored to the stated needs and interests of the participants. By 1986 there were 199 sites throughout Ontario that participated regularly, and there were approximately 25,000 individual registrations in the 1985-86 seasons. Our results from this 3-year pilot study have indicated the feasibility of the medium and its acceptance by health professionals. The next stage of the program's evaluation will include analyses of its impact on clinical practice and on the health status of patients.</ABSTRACT>

We reanalysed the data by means of recognized standards for treatment success and found little evidence that the treatment had any reliable effect on attempts to quit that lasted at least 3 months: 8.5% and 4.8% of the groups with and without supportive follow-up respectively abstained for more than 3 months. We discuss a problem of the experimental design (longer evaluative follow-up for the control group than for the treatment group) and cost-benefit issues.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Kozlowski and Page have criticized a study published in 1982 in CMAJ on the effects of supportive follow-up on the rate at which patients quit smoking cigarettes. We agree with some of their general sentiments about the need for establishing a consensus on the evaluation of smoking cessation programs. More specifically, we defend the particular analysis originally used, given the state of knowledge and constraints on the study. We examine their main objections: the definition of successful cessation, the design of the study, the exclusion of patients lost to follow-up, the methods of statistical analysis used and the strength of more recent evidence on the usefulness of follow-up visits. We believe that the role of supportive follow-up deserves further evaluation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A smoking cessation intervention program for family physicians.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Family physicians are able to approach many patients who smoke but are often hesitant to help them quit. Lack of knowledge about effective interventions is a major reason for this hesitancy. The important components that have been tested in physician-initiated smoking cessation interventions are advice to quit, information about the risks of smoking and techniques for quitting, nicotine gum, setting a date for quitting and offers of supportive follow-up visits. We describe a cessation program developed for family physicians that incorporates these factors into three types of visits over a 2-month period: the challenge visit, which occurs during a regular office visit and focuses on advice and setting a date to quit; the quit-date visit, which involves instructing patients on the proper use of nicotine gum, if applicable, and confirming their desire to quit; and four supportive follow-up visits, which provide continuing encouragement for 2 months and allow physicians to monitor withdrawal symptoms, relapses and other problems. Such a program can be effectively incorporated into a general practice.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Increased rates of illness and death from asthma in Canada.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Recent rates of illness and death from asthma in Canada and rates of hospital admission/separation for asthma were examined by age group and region. The death rates were higher in 1982-84 than in 1970-72, especially among those aged 15 to 34 years. Increases were also noted in hospital admission/separation rates, especially among those less than 15 years of age. Hospital admission/separation rates were highest in the Maritime provinces and Saskatchewan, whereas death rates were highest in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Examination of death certificates for coding errors and recoding of certificates to a single (8th) revision of the International Classification of Diseases indicated that changes in disease coding and errors in coding did not account for the significant increase in rates of death from asthma for those aged 15 to 34 years. These increases in rates of illness and death from asthma are unexplained and warrant further investigation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The diagnosis of dementia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The diagnosis of dementia in the elderly has important personal and social consequences, and a small proportion of cases initially diagnosed may be reversible. An understanding of the operating characteristics and cost-effectiveness of clinical signs and symptoms and of laboratory investigations in the diagnosis of dementia is needed to diagnose accurately yet contain costs. Using published criteria, we critically appraised the current scientific literature on the diagnosis of dementia. The articles that essentially satisfied our criteria suggested that duration and severity of dementia best predicted reversibility and the need for computed tomography of the head. A decision rule may be used to select among a number of investigations now advocated as routine in diagnosing dementia, with little or no risk of missing clinically significant diagnoses and with appreciable cost savings. The reversibility of dementia may not be as major an issue as previously believed, since most instances may be early, atypical presentations of Alzheimer-type dementia.</ABSTRACT>

- The increasing number of accidents associated with off-road motor vehicles used for recreational purposes prompted this prospective study. During 1985 the records of victims of all motor vehicle accidents who were seen at the Hudson Bay Union Hospital, Hudson Bay, Sask., were studied; patients involved in on-road vehicle accidents were included for comparison. Emphasis was placed on age, vehicle type, mechanism of accident, injury severity and the use of safety features. Almost half of the victims of off-road vehicle accidents were under 16 years of age. The poor adherence to government legislation and manufacturer recommendations was evident in the number of people who did not wear helmets or use headlights.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- After "Eve": whither proxy decision-making?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One of the most difficult problems facing physicians is how to approach proxy decisions made on behalf of congenitally incompetent patients. The author considers two recent court cases that attempt to provide guidelines: Re Stephen Dawson, which opts for a substituted-judgement approach, and Eve v. Mrs E.) which injoins best-interests considerations. The author explores the impact of Eve v. Mrs. E. as superseding Re Stephen Dawson, considers its ethical implications and attempts to clarify the best-interests criterion by sketching some guidelines for its interpretation. In so doing, he tries to reconcile the two decisions by laying bare their common underlying ethical rationale. The author concludes by pointing out some ethically questionable implications of Eve v. Mrs. E. in the area of allocation of health care resources.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of one- and two-dose regimens of influenza vaccine for elderly men.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In November and December 1984, 102 male residents of a long-term care facility (mean age 74.6 [extremes 59 and 97] years) received 0.5 ml of trivalent inactivated whole-virion influenza vaccine, containing 15 micrograms of the hemagglutinin of each of A/Philippines/2/82 (H3N2), A/Chile/83 (H1N1) and B/USSR/83. A second dose of the vaccine was administered to a subgroup of 55 randomly chosen subjects 8 weeks later. Serum samples were collected from all the subjects before and 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after administration of the first dose and were assayed for hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) antibody to each of the three antigens. At 8 weeks there were significant increases (p less than 0.05) in the geometric mean titre of antibody and in the proportion of subjects with HAI antibody titres of 1:40 or more (except to the B/USSR antigen) in both groups. There were no differences between the groups at 8 weeks or at 16 weeks (8 weeks after administration of the second dose of vaccine) in the frequency of seroconversion, the geometric mean titre or the proportion of subjects with HAI antibody titres of 1:40 or more. Overall, 60%, 32% and 13% of the 102 subjects had titres of 1:40 or more to the A/Philippines, A/Chile and B/USSR antigens respectively at 16 weeks. The results suggest that a second dose of influenza vaccine given 8 weeks after the first does not enhance the immune response in elderly men and that a substantial proportion of this population remains unprotected against infection (having HAI antibody titres of less than 1:40) during the influenza season.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Maternal and neonatal outcome in pregnancies with no risk factors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between November 1979 and April 1984, 790 consecutive pregnant women who considered themselves as having a "normal" pregnancy were followed in private practice from 9 weeks' gestation until 6 weeks post partum. The women had no pre-existing disease or problem classified as a risk to the pregnancy at the time of their first visit, had a singleton pregnancy and gave birth at Notre-Dame Hospital, Montreal. Maternal complications occurred during the course of pregnancy in 181 women (23%). Complications were mostly related to obstetric conditions (10%), such as preterm labour, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and antepartum hemorrhage, or to medical conditions (12%), the most prevalent of which was hypertension (77% of medical conditions). Neonatal complications occurred in 183 infants (23%). The corrected perinatal death rate was 2.5 per 1000. Prematurity, IUGR and dysmaturity/postmaturity accounted for nearly half of the complications. Hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 7% of the cases. Among women without any maternal complications during pregnancy, the frequency rate of neonatal complications was 19%, compared with 23% among the entire group of 790 women. Our results suggest that the absence of maternal complications does not protect the infant from a neonatal complication. Further refinement is needed to identify markers of obstetric, medical and neonatal complications in pregnancies with no risk factors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The history and present status of radiographic screening for breast carcinoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Many of the perceived and actual difficulties in the creation of screening centers have been solved or are amenable to solution. The amount of radiation delivered to the breast during mammography no longer poses a significant risk and there is ample evidence that screening mammography can detect occult disease. While substantial evidence is lacking with respect to a decrease in mortality in patients under 50 years of age, there is an unequivocal gain in those over 50 years of age. Other concerns center around the number of trained radiologists available to interpret large numbers of screening mammograms, the use of lay screeners to minimize the physician shortage and the availability of instruction centers to educate those radiologists not formally trained in mammography. The question of quality control is closely tied to the training of the radiologist and must be addressed if screening centers are to function efficiently. All of the above are correctable to a greater or lesser degree, but the problem of cost remains. To survey all women over 40 years of age at a cost of $50.00 per examination would require an expenditure in excess of two billion dollars a year, a staggering sum even in the context of the economy of the 1980s. It is necessary that these costs be lowered if the full potential of a major cancer detection procedure is to be realized. This conference has both the responsibility and opportunity to perform a significant service for the women of the US. We ask all of you to devote your greatest ingenuity to achieving its major purpose, the development of a practical strategy for cost reduction in mammography. While it may not be possible to achieve all that we wish, the formulation of any reasonable plan to increase public access will be a major accomplishment. I remind you of a French aphorism: "The greatest crime is to do nothing because we fear we can only do a little."</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Results of isolated regional perfusion in the treatment of malignant soft tissue tumors of the extremities.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- High-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities continue to pose problems of local disease control and deaths from distant metastases. Between 1969 and 1976, eight patients with primary and six with recurrent high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were treated by isolated regional perfusion with cytostatics and local excision. None received systemic adjuvant chemotherapy or external-beam radiotherapy. During the follow-up (median, 13 years) five patients (36%) developed distant metastases. One was cured after resection of a pulmonary metastasis. In one other patient (7%) recurrent local disease was diagnosed after 48 months; he was cured after resection of the local lesion followed by postoperative external beam radiotherapy. The actuarial 5-year and 10-year survival was 69%. Treatment caused no cardiovascular complications and there was no postoperative mortality.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Predictive value of the early response to chemotherapy in high-risk stages II and III Hodgkin's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A series of 60 patients with "high risk" Stage II and III Hodgkin's disease (B symptoms, or large mediastinal mass, or E lung disease) were staged without laparotomy and treated with combined modality treatment: mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (6 MOPP) plus radiotherapy. Patients were restaged after the first three courses of MOPP and the status of response to therapy at that time was called early response to chemotherapy (ERC). The rate of nitrogen mustard and procarbazine delivery (MRD) during the first three cycles of chemotherapy also was assessed. At the completion of the therapy patients were restaged and the final response was assessed. Fifty-two (86.7%) patients entered complete remission (CR). Forty-eight percent of the complete responders achieved CR in the first three courses of MOPP. Eight-year survival and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the patients achieving CR were 71% and 73%, respectively. Survival and DFS were significantly better for the patients who achieved CR in the first three cycles of chemotherapy than for patients who entered CR at a later stage of therapy: 8-year survival 90% versus 55% (P = 0.00); 8-year DFS 87% versus 59% (P = 0.01). The attainment of a complete ERC was adversely affected by lymphocyte depletion (LD) histologic type (P = 0.01) and MRD less than 65% (P = 0.04). However, when a multivariate regression analysis was used, ERC was the only significant prognostic variable for survival and DFS and its predictive value was confirmed even after correction by MRD. These data suggest that the rapidity of response to chemotherapy could be an important prognostic factor in high-risk Stage II and III Hodgkin's disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dacarbazine in high-risk childhood melanoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four of four children with clinical Stage II-IIIB childhood melanoma treated at The University of Texas System Cancer Center M.D. Anderson Hospital with surgical excision of gross disease and adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dimethyl triazeno-imidazole carboxamide (dacarbazine) were alive without evidence of disease at 2, 6, 9.5, and 10.5 years after treatment. In one of the four patients suspected pulmonary nodules developed shortly after the start of chemotherapy, but regressed completely with continued treatment. In another patient with a primary left wrist melanoma and palpable epitrochlear and axillary nodes, there was dramatic shrinkage of nodal disease during chemotherapy and subsequent biopsies were cytologically negative. The expected survival of children with this rare condition when diagnosed at a comparably advanced stage and treated primarily by surgery is 32% compared with the 100% survival in these four cases. Although dacarbazine has not been notably successful as adjuvant therapy in high-risk adult melanoma, data from this small series is suggestive of an adjuvant effect in high-risk childhood melanoma and merits further study although the rarity of this condition may make a controlled trial difficult.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chemotherapy with mitoxantrone in combination with continuous infusion vinblastine for metastatic breast cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The efficacy of mitoxantrone in combination with vinblastine was assessed in 156 patients with metastatic breast cancer who had been treated previously with one or multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. Mitoxantrone was given by random assignment, either as a 10 mg/m2 single intravenous dose or in five consecutive daily fractions of 2 mg2. Vinblastine was given as a continuous intravenous infusion of 1.2 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. In 115 evaluable patients previously treated with doxorubicin, 21 objective responses (18%) and 11 minor responses (10%) were observed with similar distribution in the two treatment groups. Median time to progression was 27 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively. Eight (32%) of 25 patients who had not received doxorubicin achieved objective remissions and two (8%) had minor responses. Toxic effects were similar for the two treatment schedules. Major toxicities were myelosuppression and neutropenic fever. Other toxicities were mild. Cardiotoxicity, presumably caused by mitoxantrone, occurred in four patients. The combination of mitoxantrone and vinblastine appeared to offer no advantage over single-agent therapy, probably because of the dosage reduction required by the overlapping myelosuppressive toxicity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Failure of adjuvant chemotherapy in testicular cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two cases of failure of adjuvant chemotherapy after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection of Stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumors are described. In both cases, initial surgical resection was complete, and two cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin were administered in an appropriate dose and schedule. Although one patient remains without evidence of disease 12 months after initiation of salvage chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin, the other patient died of progressive disease despite intensive treatment with cisplatin and etoposide. Adjuvant therapy for Stage II germ cell tumors is not conventional treatment, and should be applied only in investigative settings where the long term effects and toxicity can be monitored, and does not reduce the need for frequent and thorough follow-up of treated patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Drug extravasation along the route of a peritoneal catheter during intraperitoneal chemotherapy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A patient receiving intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside developed an abdominal skin rash similar in appearance to Cullen's sign. She subsequently received intraperitoneal mitoxantrone, which became visible in the skin close to the peritoneal catheter tract in the region of the skin rash within 24 hours of drug administration. There was no evidence for drug extravasation from the entry portal of the peritoneal catheter or visible fluid leakage. Although the clinical picture was dramatic there was no significant clinical sequela to the extravasation of these drugs. The potential significance of this event is discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis in Hodgkin's disease. Rapid diagnosis and treatment resulting in neurologic recovery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Intramedullary spinal cord metastases are uncommon in Hodgkin's disease and have a poor prognosis. This prognosis reflects the refractory or widely disseminated status of the disease at the time of development of neurological symptoms and difficulties in diagnosis. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have enabled more rapid and specific diagnosis of spinal cord diseases. The authors report a patient who presented with Brown-Sequard syndrome due to intramedullary spinal cord infiltration from Hodgkin's disease. This patient was diagnosed promptly and with rapid initiation of radiation and chemotherapy, she has had neurologic recovery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Computed tomography and lymphography in the presurgical staging of early carcinoma of the uterine cervix.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The value of bipedal lymphography and computed tomography (CT) in the presurgical staging of early carcinoma of the uterine cervix was analysed in 62 patients by histologic examination of pelvic lymph nodes and parametrial extension at the time of surgery. Macroscopic invasion of the lymph nodes was detected in 33% of the patients by CT and in 17% by lymphography. Microscopic invasion was suspected in 9% by CT scan and in 38% by lymphography. Physical examination with measurement of the tumor diameter was more predictive for regional extension of the disease as compared to lymphography and CT. CT may detect subclinical parametrial invasion but overestimation of the extent of the disease is common. Bipedal lymphography and CT add only limited information to the routine presurgical staging of cancer of the uterine cervix.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hodgkin's disease in hairy cell leukemia. Phenotypic characterization of neoplastic cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A case of Hodgkin's disease (HD) in a patient with long-standing hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is reported. The diagnosis of HCL was confirmed by clinical features (chronic illness with marked splenomegaly) and hematopathologic findings (increase of characteristic hairy cells with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in peripheral blood and bone marrow). Cervical lymphadenopathy first appeared 6 years after the diagnosis of HCL, and histologic features of the node were characteristic of HD. As it was possible that the neoplastic cells of both lesions might have originated from a single clone, their phenotypic features were defined. The hairy cells were found to bear surface immunoglobulin, receptors for complement components, leukocyte common antigen, and antigen defined by LN-1 monoclonal antibody, whereas lymph node lesion was characterized as HD because the Reed-Sternberg-like cells were positive for Leu M1 antigen, lysozyme, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and nonspecific cross-reacting antigen. Since there was no evidence indicating a common clonal origin, it is more likely to consider that both lesions are derived from different clones.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Stromal cell effects on clonal growth of tumors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clonal growth of tumor cell lines originating from a variety of solid tumors was studied. The seeding efficiency of these tumors in methylcellulose medium was in the range of 0.036 to 0.177. Stromal cell lines from mouse bone marrow as well as primary stromal cells from human bone marrow stimulated the growth of HCT and oat human carcinoma cells 32-fold and 25-fold, respectively. In contrast, these stromal cells inhibited the in vitro cloning of human and mouse sarcoma cell lines. Both activities of the stromal cells diffused through agar layers and operated across species barriers. Despite the diffusable nature of the factors involved, no biologic activity was observed in concentrated conditioned media prepared in the presence or absence of serum. Human foreskin fibroblasts tested under identical conditions, could neither stimulate nor inhibit the clonal growth of tumors. This preferential growth of tumor cells in the presence of tissue specific stroma may be used as an in vitro model for the study of the role of stromal cells in tumor cell spread.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Immunocytochemical evidence of molecular photoreceptor markers in cerebellar medulloblastomas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- With the use of antisera against bovine retinal S-antigen and bovine opsin the authors demonstrate that in cerebellar medulloblastomas certain tumor cells display immunocytochemical properties characteristic of retinal photoreceptors and pinealocytes. S-antigen-like and opsin-like immunoreactions occur in nine of 28 medulloblastomas investigated. All tumors displaying S-antigen-like immunoreactive neoplastic cells also contain opsin-like immunoreactive cells; however, the opsin-like immunoreactive cells were less frequent than the S-antigen-like immunoreactive cells throughout all positive cases. The immunoreactive cells displayed several long processes. Generally, both S-antigen and opsin-like immunoreactive cells considerably vary in number among individual tumors. The results indicate that certain neoplastic cells of medulloblastoma are capable of expression of photoreceptor-specific proteins and, thus, may be closely related to tumor cells of retinoblastoma and pineocytomas previously shown to bind antisera against retinal S-antigen and opsin. No S-antigen and opsin-like immunoreaction was found in malignant teratomas and germinomas of the pineal gland, oat cell tumors, astrocytomas, ependymomas, oligodendrogliomas, glioblastomas, gangliogliomas, gangliocytoma, ganglioneuroblastomas, neuroblastomas, and esthesioneuroblastoma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- New subgrouping of small thyroid carcinomas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clinicopathologic findings on small thyroid carcinomas measuring 10 mm or less in diameter were analyzed in 78 thyroidectomied cases. The authors divided small thyroid tumors into two subgroups according to diameter: 0 less than or equal to 5 mm (classified as minute carcinoma) and 5 less than 0 less than or equal to 10 mm (classified as tiny carcinomas). Characteristics including sex, age, histologic type, extrathyroid invasion, and lymph node metastasis were examined in each subgroup. In patients with minute carcinoma, very few incidences of extrathyroid invasion and lymph node metastasis were found. However, these involvements, especially lymph node metastasis, were found more frequently in patients with tiny carcinoma. The incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis was 13% in minute carcinoma and 59% in tiny carcinoma. (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest the need for more careful observation and treatment of tiny carcinomas, especially with respect to lymph node metastasis. In accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the histologic types of thyroid carcinoma were classified into papillary and follicular carcinomas. The papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma ratios were compared between the two subgroups. The discovery rate of follicular carcinoma was significantly higher in minute carcinoma than in tiny carcinoma (P less than 0.005). This suggests that the papillary carcinoma/follicular carcinoma ratio (p/f) increases as the size of the carcinoma increases, and that follicular carcinoma is the "seed," or initial form, of thyroid cancer. The female-male ratio in small thyroid cancer suggests that there is no sex difference in carcinogenesis but that there is more probability for cancer development in the thyroid in women.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inflammation and/or necrosis of tumors cannot account for fever in most febrile patients with Hodgkin's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Inflammation and/or necrosis (I/N) of the tumor are generally believed to be a cause of fever in patients with Hodgkin's disease. However, there have been few studies in the literature which can corroborate this common belief. Inflammation and/or necrosis were studied in biopsy specimens of 140 untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease (57 febrile and 83 afebrile). In 37 of the 140 tumors I/N were readily observed; 18 were from febrile patients, and 19 from afebrile. Thus, it is evident that I/N cannot account for fever in the majority of febrile patients, necessitating an alternative explanation. Among the patients with I/N of their tumor, fever occurred most often in male patients and in virtually all patients who had histologic types other than nodular sclerosis. However, it was peculiarly absent in the great majority of patients whose tumors were of the nodular sclerosis type. This paradoxic inverse correlation of fever with I/N of tumors in patients with the nodular sclerosing histologic type has not been described previously.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 16 patients with small intestinal leiomyosarcoma. Limited utility of immunophenotyping.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clinicopathologic data including immunophenotypic expression of 16 new cases of small intestinal leiomyosarcoma are presented. Patient age ranged from 27 to 87 years (mean, 61 years) with a 2.2:1 male-female ratio. Eighty-eight percent of tumors occurred distally, i.e., in the jejunoileum. Considerable histologic heterogeneity was noted including epithelioid, myxoid, and sclerotic variants. Stratification by histologic grade suggests important clinical subsets. Only in grade I tumors is surgical extirpation alone potentially curative. Grade II tumors are associated with meaningful survival usually measured in years, however, nearly all patients can be expected to die from their tumors. Grade III sarcomas are fully malignant and rapidly progressive: except for one case with limited follow-up, all patients with Grade III sarcomas died of disease with a mean survival of only nine months (median, 2 months). Immunostaining with antibodies directed against vimentin, muscle-specific actin, desmin, and S-100 protein were performed. Only antivimentin was uniformly reactive. Sixty-three percent of cases tested showed actin immunoreactivity, and no tumors revealed immunohistochemically detectable desmin or S-100 protein. Although many small bowel stromal sarcomas appear "poorly differentiated" by immunohistochemical methods presently available, that they are indeed leiomyosarcomas seems most likely from their intramural location and light histologic study. The limited utility of immunophenotyping and the importance of histologic grading are stressed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acridine-orange flow cytometry of urinary bladder washings for the detection of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The influence of prior local therapy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Analysis of cellular DNA and RNA contents of 249 bladder irrigation specimens from 129 patients with a history of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder was performed using acridine-orange flow cytometry (FCM). Washings from patients with prior intravesical chemotherapy or radiation therapy were compared to those from patients with no history of treatment other than tumor resection to evaluate the reliability of FCM for the detection of tumor and the influence of prior local therapy on that reliability. Five FCM patterns were defined on the basis of DNA and RNA indexes in relationship to peripheral blood lymphocytes. FCM results were compared to cytologic findings in 237 cases, cystoscopic findings in 230 cases, and histologic data in 99 cases. Presence of a single diploid stem line was associated with absence of bladder tumor in 71% of cases from patients treated with surgery alone or with radiation therapy, but there was residual tumor in 53% of patients exposed to prior local chemotherapy. An elevated RNA content in a diploid cell population did not provide additional diagnostic information. Presence of an aneuploid stem line was associated with tumor in 85% of cases, regardless of prior therapy. Aneuploidy predicted the appearance of tumor in four of six patients with a negative cystoscopy. Tetraploidy (greater than 10% of total cell population) was associated with tumor in 79% of patients treated with surgery alone, whereas no tumor was found in more than 50% of patients who had undergone prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. This study stresses the importance of prior treatment history in evaluating the results of DNA-FCM for bladder cancer. It demonstrates the unreliability of FCM diploid and tetraploid cell populations in patients previously treated by local chemotherapy or radiation. However, it also supports prior observations that DNA-aneuploidy and DNA-tetraploidy are useful for detecting and predicting bladder cancer in patients submitted to surgery alone.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Use of nude mouse xenografts as preclinical screens. Characterization of xenograft-derived melanoma cell lines.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cell lines derived from human melanoma xenografts were characterized for surface markers, karyotype abnormalities, and in vitro drug sensitivity. Xenografts were established using metastatic explants from untreated patients and passaged in nude mice. Cell lines were readily established from melanoma xenografts, and formed colonies when plated in semisolid media. The lines expressed human melanoma-associated and other surface antigens, human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzymes, and contained only human chromosomes. They failed to express murine histocompatibility determinants and were negative for murine viruses by mouse antibody production assay. Karyotypes showed abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 6, and 7 similar to other melanomas. In vitro chemosensitivity profiles were compared using cell line and xenograft colony-forming assays. Values were similar for the original xenografts and their cell lines. Xenograft-derived human melanoma lines resemble other melanoma cell lines and primary melanomas with respect to surface antigens and karyotype abnormalities, and are appropriate models for studying in vitro drug sensitivity. When used as a model for transition from solid tumor to cell line, these studies suggest cell lines closely mirror in vitro chemosensitivities of parent tumor cells. However, occasional, unpredictable changes in sensitivity to some drugs occurs during this transition.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Observations of serum trace elements in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Serum trace elements (STE) were measured in 50 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 100 normal subjects. Copper was higher in patients than in controls (1.50 +/- 0.06 versus 1.10 +/- 0.02 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.001), increased steadily from Stage 0 to Stage 4 (P = 0.002), and correlated with the lymphocyte count and serum lactate dehydrogenase (P less than 0.01) but not with acute phase reactants. Zinc was lower in patients than in controls (0.94 +/- 0.03 versus 1.10 +/- 0.02 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.001). Zinc (NS), selenium (P = 0.039), and calcium (P = 0.033), were decreased in Stages 3-4 as compared to Stages 0-2. The copper-to-zinc ratio (CZR) increased continuously from Stage 0 to Stage 4 (P less than 0.001). Discriminant analysis between two groups, Stage 0-2 and Stage 3-4, based on serum copper, zinc, calcium, and protein levels, allowed for a correct classification of 94% of the patients. Moreover, the clinical staging of the remaining 6% was modified retrospectively according to the results of discriminant analysis. It was concluded that (1) serum copper and CZR are useful indices of the extent of disease, (2) they are independent of a nonspecific acute phase reaction, (3) STE determination could be helpful in the staging of a limited number of CLL patients, and (4) zinc deficiency could contribute to immune dysfunction in CLL.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Optic gliomas. A reanalysis of the University of California, San Francisco experience.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-eight cases of optic gliomas seen at the University of California, San Francisco, were reviewed. Two patients died in the postoperative period and were excluded from the follow-up analysis. Twenty-nine cases (76%) involved the optic chiasm, nine (24%) cases were confined to one optic nerve. Most tumors were slow growing and progressive although there were three cases of adult chiasmal gliomas which exhibited unusually aggressive behavior. The three cases are presented in detail. After a mean follow-up period of 9.4 years, the 10-year overall actuarial survival was 87%. Relapse-free survival was 55% at 10 years. Chiasmal tumors had a poorer prognosis compared to optic nerve tumors with 56% of chiasmal tumors recurring versus 22% of optic nerve tumors. Radiotherapy was beneficial in chiasmal gliomas, initially improving vision in 35% (6/17) and decreasing recurrence from 86% (6/7) without radiation therapy to 45% (9/20) with radiation therapy. Optic gliomas are not benign, self-limiting lesions, and therefore require treatment. Radiotherapy is effective in chiasmal gliomas and should be used early in the management of these tumors. No advantage to radiotherapy could be demonstrated for optic nerve gliomas, although the number of these cases analyzed was small.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Microscopically oriented histologic surgery for head and neck mucosal cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Frozen section directed surgery, called MOHS, has been successfully utilized in the resection of primary epidermoid tumors of the head and neck. For the 93 cases reviewed in this study, 70% had microscopically identified tumor 1 cm away from clinically evident disease. Tumor spread was along planes of least resistance, most commonly in the submucosa. Microscopically directed excisions were able to trace and remove these tumor extensions. Local control in 93 patients with 2-year follow-up was 91% and, with salvage of recurrences, was 95%. The authors' observations suggest three important concepts. First, epidermoid cancer of the head and neck grows as a continuous neoplasm. Second, this work casts serious doubt on the concept of "field cancerization" or multiple primaries as a cause of local recurrence. Third, conventional frozen section analysis of surgical margins is highly unlikely to discover microscopic extensions because many tumor extensions are thin, finger-like projections which require examination of the entire surgical margin to detect.</ABSTRACT>

- Adenocarcinoma of the ethmoid sinus is a rare tumor which has been epidemiologically linked to woodworking in the furniture industry. It has a low propensity to metastasize and has not been previously reported to cause spinal cord compression. A symptomatic epidural spinal cord compression was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in a former furniture worker with widely disseminated metastases. The clinical features of ethmoid sinus adenocarcinoma and neoplastic spinal cord compression, and the comparative value of MRI scanning in the neuroradiologic diagnosis of spinal cord compression are reviewed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diagnostic reliability of combined physical examination, mammography, and fine-needle puncture ("triple-test") in breast tumors. A prospective study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A prospective study of 622 consecutively registered patients with 650 breast tumors was performed to appraise the reliability of combined physical examination, mammography, and fine-needle puncture (triple test) in the preoperative diagnosis of such tumors. All malignant as well as benign test results were confirmed by subsequent histologic examination. The diagnostic accuracy of the triple test at benign changes is comparable to that of histologic examination, but participation of experienced radiologists and cytologists as well as persons skilled in fine-needle puncture is required. Twenty-eight percent of the planned excisional biopsies were made superfluous by the fine-needle puncture, which immediately revealed the tumor as a cyst, abscess, or hematoma. For this reason, too, fine-needle puncture is recommended as a routine procedure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Coexistent carcinoma in congenital dilatation of the bile duct and anomalous arrangement of the pancreatico-bile duct. Carcinogenesis of coexistent gall bladder carcinoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- From 1972 to 1985, 40 cases of congenital dilatation of the bile duct (CDBD) were experienced in the department of the authors. Those consisted of 19 cases of anomalous arrangement of the pancreatico-bile duct (P-B anomaly), five of bile duct carcinoma, and two of gall bladder carcinoma. In addition, four patients who showed no dilatation of the bile duct in spite of the presence of a P-B anomaly were experienced, and coexistent gall bladder carcinoma was present in three of four cases. The incidence of bile duct carcinoma associated with CDBD is very high. However, coexistent gall bladder carcinoma in CDBD is a new topic, and coexistent intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma in CDBD is extremely rare. This report presents interesting and rare cases of coexistent carcinomas in these anomalies and investigates their carcinogenesis, particularly that of gall bladder carcinoma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The value of prophylactic antibiotics during the insertion of long-term indwelling silastic right atrial catheters in cancer patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Over a 3.5 year period from August 1982 to December 1985, 200 Hickman catheters (Evermed, Medina, WA) were inserted into patients at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. One hundred sixty catheters were placed in patients with malignant disease, many of whom were immunosuppressed at the time of catheter insertion. Seventy of 160 (44%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 90 (56%) did not. The mean age of each group was 23 years (range, 2 to 70 years), and the patients in each group were statistically similar in sex, underlying disease, and routine preoperative hematologic and biochemical evaluation. Exit-site wound infections occurred in 50 of 90 (55.5%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 12 of 70 (17%) patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tunnel and incision site infections. The mean duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 2.9 days (SD, 1.2 days). Organisms cultured from catheter associated infections, included Staphylococcus epidermidis 36, S. aureus 30, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, Escherichia coli 1, and diphtheroids non-CDC-JK 3. Vancomycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis in 64 patients, Kefzol (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in one, oxacillin in three, nafcillin in one, and Septra (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) in one. The data indicate that the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces exit site infection and may reduce both tunnel and incision site infection. Prophylactic antibiotic coverage should be provided to patients during insertion of long-term indwelling right atrial catheters.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Thermal irritation and esophageal cancer in northern Iran.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The ingestion of hot food and beverages has repeatedly been postulated as a risk factor for cancer of the esophagus. Although several studies have been performed on the correlation of the consumption of hot tea and esophageal cancer, no research has heretofore documented, by actually measuring, the temperature at which the tea is consumed. Therefore, a tea temperature measurement study was carried out in the Caspian Littoral of Iran, where the frequency of esophageal cancer is the highest in the world. The study was conducted during a population-food-habits survey in 1968 to 1969, which was performed before statistics were available regarding the incidence rate or geographic distribution of this disease in the region. Ten years later, when the results of the Caspian Cancer Registry were analyzed, the data from this nutritional study was compared with the regional distribution of esophageal cancer. A geographic correlation exists between the frequency of consumption of hot tea and the incidence of esophageal cancer. Seventy-two percent of the people in the low-risk region of esophageal cancer drank their tea at the relatively moderate temperature of below 55 degrees C, compared with only 3% in the high risk region. More importantly, 62% of the adult population in the high-risk region, as opposed to 19% in the low-risk region, drank their tea at a temperature of over 65 degrees C. In addition to the thermal irritation of hot tea, the following considerations cannot be ignored: the carcinogenicity role of tannins; the cancer-promoting effect of phenols; and the absorption facilitating role of hot tea. Alcohol and tobacco, the most important risk factors for cancer of the esophagus in many countries, play a negligible role in the cause of this disease in northern Iran. In this region, nutritional deficiencies--a special diet for pregnant women composed of sour pomegranite seeds, black pepper, and garlic; consumption of bread contaminated with silica fibre; and ingestion of opium and opium dross--combined with long-lasting and daily thermal irritation of the esophagus with very hot tea play an important role in the development of this disease. The inhabitants of the high-risk area consumed roughly 2.5 times more tea than their counterparts in the low-risk area. In addition, the mean daily consumption of tea leaves per person (average) was 5.7 g and 3.8 g, respectively.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- National survey of patterns of care for testis cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A national survey of testicular cancer documented recent trends in disease characteristics, treatment, and outcome, providing a basis for progress being achieved on a community basis. A long-term study of 3285 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 1975 was compared with a short-term study of 1887 patients diagnosed in 1983. An increase of the symptom of a lump in the testis from 23.1% to 31.2% and a mass as a sign of cancer from 44.5% to 53.8% suggests earlier detection of testis cancer by the patient and physician. Changes in the methods of diagnosis reflect the changing technology of tumor diagnosis. The 10-year survival rates for pathologic Stage I seminoma (82.6% of all seminomas) exceeded 96%. For pathologic Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (51.7% of all NSGCT), 10-year survival was 87.1%; whereas for Stage III (18.7% of all NSGCT) it was 22.1%. The impact of the important advances in chemotherapy is reflected in the increase of 1-year survival of Stage III NSGCT from 50.5% to 78.4%. Testis cancer can be cured in most patients.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Diagnostic advances currently have exceeded therapeutic gain. The present, however, is a transition phase. Chemotherapy, for example, has become curative for some tumors in recent years, rather than merely palliative, due to the precision permitted by advances in molecular biology. At this time, acceleration in the basic oncologic sciences has surpassed therapeutic advance, but therapeutic translation has begun and we will require clinical scientists to increase the bridge from laboratory to bedside if we are to speed the contribution of the so-called biologic revolution to cancer control.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- End results, interhospital differences, and trends in patterns of care for gynecologic cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Survival rates represent one measure of population-wide progress in cancer control. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) document that, during the 1970s, survival rates for several cancers improved. For the major gynecologic cancers and breast cancer, improvements are evident for some sites but, areas of decline also are observed. Black women in the US have a poorer survival rate than white women and the trend in recent years suggest that this gap may be widening. Comparisons of survival rates from comprehensive cancer centers and population-based rates indicate differences in outcomes associated with the treatment setting. Data from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) patterns of care surveys suggest substantial interhospital variability in cancer survival which is largely explained by characteristics of the patient populations served. Recent studies of patterns of care document major shifts in treatment practices in the US and provide insight concerning the rate at which treatment changes are adopted at the community level.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Barriers and incentives for primary-care physicians in cancer prevention and detection.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that nearly a million new cases of cancer will occur and that approximately 500,000 lives will be lost in 1987. These figures may double by the year 2000 primarily because of our aging population, with age being the leading risk factor for cancer. It is believed that most cancers can either be prevented or treated successfully if they are diagnosed early. Primary-care physicians and other health professionals delivering information on prevention and performing early diagnostic studies in various ambulatory settings represent the key to the reduced complications and mortality of cancer by virtue of their position in the health care delivery system within communities. Barriers and incentives for delivering these all important health measures are examined and suggestions are made for their accomplishment. It is recommended that the primary thrust should be toward the development of methodology which will allow the primary care physician to institute these measures in his regular medical practice and to coordinate them with other health maintenance and early diagnostic activities in the ambulatory setting.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The use of screening mammography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Screening mammography, breast x-ray examination of women without any symptoms or signs of breast cancer, is a safe and efficacious procedure. Modern mammography, which is a low-dose radiographic examination, allows safe and correct diagnosis of about 90% of the cancers. Occult breast cancers, those found only with screening mammography, have a much lower rate of axillary node metastases and a much better prognosis, when compared with palpable breast cancers. With screening mammography, minimal breast cancers that are early in their development and have a remarkably improved prognosis can often be detected also. It is generally agreed that women with minimal cancers do not require mastectomies.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Psychological evaluation and preparation of the patient and family.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The suspected and confirmed diagnosis of cancer places stress on the patient and the family. In addition to the feelings of helplessness, guilt, frustration, alienation, and vulnerability that a diagnosis of cancer provokes, the diagnosis of gynecologic cancer can exacerbate these feelings due to its relationship to the perceived physiologic core of femininity, sexuality, and motherhood. Evaluation of the patient's existing coping skills, perceived seriousness of the illness, anticipated loss of control over physical functioning, and available family support is an essential part of the treatment plan. Preparing the patient and family for diagnosis and treatment is enhanced by supportive intervention techniques such as provision of accurate information, exploration of the patient's fears and fantasies, restoration of degrees of control in the patient's life, and exposure to peer support groups.</ABSTRACT>

All patients were treated with primary surgery consisting of total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, selective pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy and peritoneal cytology. An appreciable number of patients (144-22%) with Stage I cancers have disease outside of the uterus (lymph node metastasis, adnexal disease, intraperitoneal spread and/or malignant cells in peritoneal washings). Multiple prognostic factors particularly grade and depth of invasion are related to extrauterine disease.

<TITLE>- Altered fractionation radiation therapy for gynecologic cancers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Altered fractionation radiation therapy is one of the attempts to improve the therapeutic ratio in the hope of controlling locally advanced tumors by radiation therapy alone. This includes hypofractionation, split course fractionation, hyperfractionation, accelerated hyperfractionation, and others. Various fractionation schemes are reviewed in terms of dose and time modification for the management of various gynecologic malignancies. Of these, accelerated hyperfractionation with 10% to 15% dose reduction from conventional or traditional once daily radiation therapy appears to hold the most promise. One and one half Grays per fraction, two fractions per day were used for whole pelvis irradiation and 1.0 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day were used for whole abdomen irradiation with 4 hours between fractions, 5 days a week. Various gynecologic malignancies have been treated with these programs since 1982. Gray for Gray, tumors tend to regress more rapidly than, and the acute and late effects were quite similar to conventional once-daily radiation therapy with 1.8 Gy to 2.0 Gy per fraction. The accelerated hyperfractionation programs were generally well tolerated and deserve a randomized trial.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Synchronous occurrence of spontaneous localized calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum generates action potentials in rat cardiac ventricular myocytes at normal resting membrane potential.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Under certain conditions, spontaneous release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs in resting mammalian myocardium. In single rat ventricular myocytes, such spontaneous Ca2+ release appears localized rather than homogeneous. When the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is present in a single locus within a cell, it causes a small depolarization, which, at the normal resting potential, is subthreshold for generating an action potential. However, when spontaneous Ca2+ release occurs simultaneously at more than a single discrete locus, the resultant sarcolemmal depolarization is augmented to levels that can induce an action potential, even when this depolarization begins at the normal resting membrane potential. Thus, the synchronous occurrence of multifocal localized increases in cytosolic Ca2+ due to spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum within ventricular myocytes is a mechanism for "abnormal automaticity."</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Forward and inverse electrocardiographic calculations using resistor network models of the human torso.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An automated method of modelling the electrical properties of the human thorax from horizontal section data such as computerized tomographic scans has been used to develop both forward and inverse transformations between epicardial and body surface potential distributions. Eleven torso models with varying geometry and organ configurations have been studied. For the forward calculations, a standard dipole-like source is placed along the axis of the heart. Inverse calculations are performed using a measured body surface potential distribution and are based on a division of the surface of the heart into 25 source regions, producing epicardial potentials on these regions. A regularization method is used to stabilize the inverse solutions. Both forward and inverse solutions show substantial differences between models. These findings imply that matching models with patient geometry may be necessary in order to use such solutions in a clinical setting.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Calcium and magnesium transport by in situ mitochondria: electron probe analysis of vascular smooth muscle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The extent, time course, and reversibility of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake secondary to cellular Ca2+ influx stimulated by massive Na+ efflux were evaluated by electron probe microanalysis of rabbit portal vein smooth muscle. Strips of portal vein were Na+ loaded for 3 hours at 37 degrees C in a K+-free 1 mM ouabain solution, after which rapid Na+ efflux was induced by washing with a Na+-free K+-Li+ solution (1 mM ouabain). Li+ washing Na+-loaded portal vein produced a large transient contraction accompanied by an increase (over 100-fold) in mitochondrial Ca2+ and also significant (p less than 0.05) increases in phosphorus and Mg2+. The Ca2+ loading of the mitochondria was reversed during prolonged Li+ wash, and by 2 hours, mitochondrial Ca2+, Mg2+, and phosphorus had returned to control levels. The maximal contractile response to stimulation remained normal, demonstrating that pathologic Ca2+ loading of mitochondria is reversible in situ and compatible with normal maximal force developed by the smooth muscle. Mitochondrial Ca2+ and phosphorus uptake were reduced but still significant when the Li+ wash contained 0.2 mM Ca2+ or when ouabain was omitted. The fact that mitochondrial Ca2+ loading accompanied submaximal contractions during 0.2 mM Ca2+-Li wash suggests "supranormal" affinity of mitochondria for Ca2+ and may be due, in part, to reverse operation of the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Mitochondrial Ca2+, Mg2+, and phosphorus uptake were eliminated when the Li+ wash was performed at 2 degrees C or when the wash contained no Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of abnormally high transmural pressure in the permselectivity defect of glomerular capillary wall: a study in early passive Heymann nephritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To explore the mechanism of glomerular permselectivity defect in passive Heymann nephritis, an experimental model of human membranous glomerulopathy, Munich-Wistar rats were subjected to both micropuncture assessment of glomerular hemodynamics and whole kidney clearance measurements of graded size dextrans 10 days after injection of sheep anti-rat tubular antigen (anti-Fx1A). Compared with normal control rats, anti-Fx1A-treated animals were characterized by marked proteinuria (65 +/- 8 micrograms/min versus 6 +/- 1, p less than 0.001), markedly and significantly higher glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (40 +/- 1 mm Hg versus 33 +/- 1, p less than 0.001), depressed ultrafiltration coefficient and impaired glomerular size-selective function as determined by fractional clearance of dextrans. Calculation of membrane parameters based on a recently defined heteroporous membrane model revealed abnormally high availability of non-size selective, large pore pathways in the glomerular capillary wall of the rats with passive Heymann nephritis. To ascertain the role of the altered hemodynamic pattern in the observed defect in the size-selective function of the glomerular capillary wall, glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference was manipulated experimentally in these proteinuric rats by intra-aortic infusion of acetylcholine or angiotensin II. These agents respectively suppressed and augmented glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference and brought about a decline of and a further rise in fractional clearance of larger dextrans along with parallel changes in both urine protein excretion rate and availability of nonselective channels. These results indicate that the permselectivity defect in passive Heymann nephritis is attributable, at least in part, to impaired size selectivity of the glomerular capillary wall caused by a prevailing abnormally high transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Subclasses of cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase in left ventricular muscle and their involvement in regulating myocardial contractility.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ventricular muscle contains a low Km, cyclic AMP-specific form of phosphodiesterase (PDE III), which is believed to represent the site of action for several of new cardiotonic agents including imazodan (CI-914), amrinone, cilostamide, and enoximone. However, species differences in the inotropic response to these agents have raised questions about the relationship between PDE III inhibition and cardiotonic activity. The present study demonstrates that these differences can be accounted for by the presence of two subclasses of PDE III in ventricular muscle and variations in the intracellular localization of these two enzymes. For these experiments, PDE III was initially isolated from canine, guinea pig, and rat left ventricular muscle. The results demonstrate that canine left ventricular muscle contains two functional subclasses of PDE III: an imazodan-sensitive form, which is membrane bound, and an imazodan-insensitive form, which is soluble. Although only weakly inhibited by imazodan, this latter enzyme is potently inhibited by the selective PDE III inhibitors, Ro 20-1724 and rolipram. Guinea pig ventricular muscle also contains the imazodan-sensitive subclass of PDE III. Unlike canine left ventricle, however, thi enzyme is soluble in the guinea pig. No membrane-bound subclass of PDE III was observed in the guinea pig. Rat left ventricle possesses only the soluble form of PDE III, which apparently represents a mixture of the imazodan-sensitive and imazodan-insensitive subclasses of PDE III. Measurement of in vivo contractility in these three species showed that imazodan exerts a potent positive inotropic effect only in the dog, in which the imazodan-sensitive subclass of PDE III is membrane bound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Contracture and the calcium paradox in the rat heart.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The role of contracture in the manifestation of calcium paradox-induced damage was examined using 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) to inhibit myofibrillar activity. Calcium and sodium gain, loss of intracellular components, and changes in structure were monitored. If 30 mM BDM was added at the time of calcium repletion after 10 minutes of calcium-free perfusion, some protection was afforded, particularly at the early stages of calcium repletion. However, much greater protection was obtained if BDM was present during the final 2 minutes of calcium-free perfusion and throughout repletion. Sodium gain and loss of intracellular components were markedly attenuated, as was the incidence of severely contracted cells. Calcium gain, although significantly reduced during the period of repletion, was not abolished. After 10 minutes of repletion, a calcium content of 11.44 +/- 1.57 mumol/g dry wt was observed. This suggests that other noncontracture related routes of calcium entry are involved. If BDM is removed after 5 minutes of calcium repletion and perfusion is continued with BDM-free perfusate, there is a rapid gain of sodium, further gain of calcium, loss of intracellular components and the cells contract severely, tearing away from neighboring cells. It is evident, therefore, that returning calcium to hearts after a period of calcium-free perfusion under conditions that significantly reduce the typical calcium paradox-associated damage does not necessarily repair the underlying defect. These results support the hypothesis that contracture-induced sarcolemmal disruption may be responsible for the terminal manifestation of the calcium paradox.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sex differences in peripheral vascular adrenergic receptors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although the incidence of many vascular diseases differs in men and women, sex differences in vascular physiology have not been extensively examined in human in vivo studies. The present study compared finger blood flow responses of normal men and women with brachial artery infusions of adrenergic agonists and with other neurally and nonneurally mediated procedures. In response to phenylephrine and clonidine, men showed significant dose-related vasoconstriction while women did not. In response to isoproterenol, men showed significant dose-related vasodilation while women did not. There were no sex differences in response to intra-arterial nitroglycerin or digoxin or to reactive hyperemia, procedures that do not act through adrenergic receptors. These data show that the sensitivity and/or density of peripheral vascular adrenergic receptors is lower in women than in men. There were no sex differences in response to reflex vasoconstriction or to intra-arterial tyramine, suggesting that neurally released norepinephrine acts at alpha-adrenergic receptors that are spatially removed from those that respond to circulating catecholamines.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Electrical responses of smooth muscle cells during cholinergic vasodilation in the rabbit saphenous artery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Isolated smooth muscle tissues of the rabbit saphenous artery precontracted with norepinephrine (NE) were relaxed by acetylcholine (ACh, greater than 10(-7) M) or oxotremorine (greater than 10(-7) M), through the activation of muscarinic receptors, only when the endothelial cells were intact. ACh (greater than 10(-7) M) transiently hyperpolarized the membrane (1-4 minutes) with an associated decrease in the membrane resistance, either in the presence or absence of NE, and these changes ceased during the continuous application of ACh. The ACh-induced transient hyperpolarization was not generated after mechanically removing the endothelium or by treatment with atropine. Oxotremorine (up to 10(-5) M) did not alter the membrane potential in the presence or absence of the endothelium. NE (10(-6) M) depolarized the smooth muscle membrane, which remained unchanged by additional application of ACh or oxotremorine for more than 5 minutes, or after removal of the endothelium. The excitatory junction potential generated by perivascular nerve stimulation was inhibited by ACh (greater than 10(-9) M) or oxotremorine (greater than 10(-9) M) in a concentration-dependent manner. These inhibitory actions of ACh or oxotremorine were blocked by atropine but were not affected by removal of the endothelial cells. These results suggest that the inhibitory actions of muscarinic agonists on electrical responses of smooth muscle cells of the rabbit saphenous artery were mainly indirect, i.e., a release of inhibitory substances from the endothelial cells and the inhibition of adrenergic transmission. The former required higher concentrations of ACh or oxotremorine, thereby suggesting that the latter may be more important for vasodilation related to cholinergic mechanisms.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adenosine release by the isolated guinea pig heart in response to isoproterenol, acetylcholine, and acidosis: the minimal role of vascular endothelium.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of endothelial cells to adenosine appearing in venous effluent of isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. The adenine nucleotide pool of endothelial cells was selectively labelled by infusing 3H-adenosine (5 X 10(-8) M) into the heart for 30 minutes. Selective labelling of the endothelial adenine nucleotides was confirmed by measuring the relative specific activities of the nucleotides of coronary endothelial cells (removed from the heart by enzyme treatment). Endothelial ATP, ADP, and AMP had relative specific activities that were 49, 25, and 7 times higher, respectively, than their nucleotide counterparts in total myocardial tissue. Isoproterenol increased the release of both total adenosine and radioactive adenosine, but the relative specific activity of venous adenosine decreased dramatically. Acetylcholine, at a concentration that caused no change in left ventricular pressure but caused a decrease in coronary vascular resistance, increased the release of total adenosine. However, both radioactive adenosine release and the relative specific activity of venous effluent adenosine were decreased with acetylcholine. Infusion of hydrochloric acid caused a sustained reduction in left ventricular pressure and coronary vascular resistance. Total adenosine release fell within one minute and remained reduced during HCl. Radioactive adenosine release was elevated at 15 seconds but fell below control values at 2 minutes and remained reduced during steady-state acidosis. We conclude that the majority of the adenosine released in response to isoproterenol and acetylcholine originates from an unlabelled compartment, most likely the myocytes. Acidosis results in decreased release of adenosine from both the labelled endothelium and the unlabelled cells in the heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hydroxyl radical mediates the endothelium-dependent relaxation produced by bradykinin in mouse cerebral arterioles.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Bradykinin relaxes arterioles on the brain's surface. This response is endothelium-dependent. The data presented here confirm the hypothesis that hydroxyl free radical mediates this response and may be the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for bradykinin in this microvascular bed. The response to a locally applied bolus of bradykinin (80 micrograms/ml) was monitored by intravital TV microscopy. The response was significantly inhibited or totally blocked by the presence of superoxide dismutase 60 U/ml, catalase 46 U/ml, or deferoxamine 0.1 or 0.2 mM. The superoxide dismutase scavenges superoxide radical, which is known to enter the subarachnoid space as a consequence of cyclooxygenase activation. Cyclooxygenase is activated by bradykinin. The superoxide can form H2O2, scavenged by catalase, and the two together generate hydroxyl. The formation of hydroxyl radical is catalyzed by iron. Deferoxamine 0.1 mM scavenges the iron, blocking the generation of hydroxyl. Deferoxamine 0.2 mM also directly scavenges the hydroxyl. None of the pharmacologic probes had an effect on arteriolar diameter when locally applied without bradykinin. Since the dilation produced by bradykinin was inhibited or totally blocked by probes that prevented hydroxyl formation or directly scavenged hydroxyl radical, that radical is either an essential mediator of the arteriolar relaxation, or is the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for bradykinin in pial arterioles.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Voltage-dependent modulation of cardiac calcium channel current by optical isomers of Bay K 8644: implications for channel gating.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study investigated the voltage-dependent actions of the stereoisomers of the 1,4-dihydropyridine Bay K 8644 on calcium channel currents in heart cells. Whole-cell currents were recorded from enzymatically dispersed ventricular myocytes using the patch-clamp technique. Both enantiomers of this compound modulate calcium channel current in a voltage-dependent manner. The most prominent effect of (+)-Bay K 8644 is an inhibition of calcium channel current, which is more pronounced when currents are measured from depolarized holding potentials. (-)-Bay K 8644 resembles the racemic compound; it enhances or inhibits currents depending on holding potential. The results of this study suggest that the dual activity of the racemic compound is not because of opposing actions of its component enantiomers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Two types of calcium channels in single smooth muscle cells from rabbit ear artery studied with whole-cell and single-channel recordings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Freshly dispersed rabbit ear artery cells were studied using patch-clamp techniques to measure membrane currents in whole cells and single-channel currents in membrane patches. Whole-cell calcium currents recorded at physiologic extracellular calcium concentrations were small (approximately 10 pA). Recordings with 110 mM external barium gave much larger currents and revealed two current components with properties similar to those in other vascular smooth muscle preparations and to the calcium currents designated as T and L in heart cells and neurons. T current was activated with weak depolarizations and inactivated rapidly, while L current was activated with relatively strong depolarizations and inactivated more slowly. L current was increased by dihydropyridine agonists and decreased by dihydropyridine antagonists, while T current was unaffected. Recordings from cell-attached and outside-out membrane patches with 100 mM external barium showed unitary calcium channel currents with conductances of 8 and 25 pS. The small conductance channels had kinetic properties that accounted for T current in the whole-cell recordings, while the 25-pS channels showed the voltage dependence, the time dependence, and the dihydropyridine sensitivity expected for L-type channels. We conclude that vascular smooth muscle cells contain two types of calcium channels with properties very similar to those described for T- and L-type calcium channels in other cell types; the L current appears to be the predominant current component in whole-cell recordings.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Structural properties of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor: studies with membrane and purified receptor preparations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The contribution of hydrophobic, ionic, and disulfide bonds in the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor structure was evaluated using rat hepatic plasma membrane and purified receptor preparations. In addition, the findings were compared with similar structural evaluations of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor purified from canine lung. Both the alpha 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors contain a disulfide bond critical for ligand binding. However, the disulfide bond in the beta-receptor structure is accessible to solvent, while the disulfide bond within the alpha-receptor structure is "masked" and inaccessible to solvent. Reduction of this disulfide bond requires initial denaturation of the alpha 1-receptor. Although the tertiary structures of both receptor proteins appear to be stabilized by strong hydrophobic interactions, differential sensitivities are observed with a variety of structural perturbants, including high concentrations of sodium chloride, guanidine hydrochloride, and ethylene glycol.</ABSTRACT>

- L-type calcium channel activity of some excitable cells is markedly enhanced by beta-adrenergic agents. The enzymatic cascade underlying this important modulatory effect has been studied with patch-clamp techniques in single dialyzed ventricular cells from guinea pig heart. The steps between the binding of agonist to the beta-receptor and the increase in calcium influx can be summarized as follows: Agonist binding to beta-receptor greater than adenylate cyclase increases greater than cAMP increases greater than cA-kinase increases greater than protein phosphorylation greater than altered calcium channel properties greater than ICa increases A basal phosphorylation reaction seems not to be a prerequisite for calcium channel function. By combining molecular and functional approaches, the purified dihydropyridine-receptor complex from rabbit skeletal muscle transverse-tubules can be reconstituted in phospholipid bilayer membranes to form a functional 20-pS calcium channel that retains the principal regulatory, biochemical, and pharmacologic properties of membrane-bound L-type calcium channels.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Interaction between calcium channel ligands and calcium channels.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Distinct drug receptors for 1,4-dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines, and the benzothiazepine d-cis-diltiazem exist on voltage-dependent calcium channels. The drug receptors show reciprocal allosteric communication and are linked to calcium binding sites. The 1,4-dihydropyridine-selective receptor (probed with [3H]nimodipine) has a size (measured by radiation inactivation) identical in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain (180 kDa). To compare the sizes of 1,4-dihydropyridine receptors in different tissues, pure tritiated enantiomers of the arylazido photoaffinity probe [3H]azidopine were used to irreversibly label the purified 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (155, 65, and 32 kDa) from guinea pig skeletal muscle transverse tubules and the membrane-bound cardiac receptor. The 155 kDa polypeptide region, but not the 65 or 32 kDa bands, was specifically labelled by (-)-[3H]azidopine. (+)-[3H]Azidopine did not label any of the polypeptides in the purified receptor preparation. In contrast with the results from other investigators, a 155 kDa polypeptide was also specifically labelled in cardiac membranes by (-)-[3H]azidopine. A 34 kDa photolabelled band carries a low-affinity 1,4-dihydropyridine binding site that has no obvious relation to the channel but is abundant in heart membranes and has apparently led to erroneous results in previous affinity or photoaffinity labelling experiments. Antibodies raised against the purified skeletal muscle channel precipitate the 125I-labelled 155 kDa channel polypeptide from skeletal muscle and precipitate the three drug receptor sites from both crude and purified channel preparations. We conclude that all three drug receptor sites are localized on this polypeptide.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Planar bilayer reconstitution of calcium channels: lipid effects on single-channel kinetics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sodium current in the absence of divalents was measured through single calcium channels of skeletal muscle transverse tubules incorporated into planar bilayers composed of the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and neutral lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Channel kinetics in PE and PS are characterized by the simultaneous presence of openings of long duration (greater than 200 msec) and openings of brief duration (less than 20 msec) grouped into bursts. Accordingly, exponential distributions of open-channel lifetimes could be fitted with at least two time constants. An increase in bilayer mole fraction of PS, from XPS = 0 (pure PE) to XPS = 1.0 (pure PS), decreased open-channel lifetimes by approximately twofold to threefold. Calculations using the Gouy-Chapman theory indicate that channel lifetimes do not correlate with bilayer surface potentials generated by PS.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diencephalic regulation of respiration and arterial pressure during actual and fictive locomotion in cat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to examine by experimentation the hypothesis that the respiratory and circulatory responses during exercise are attributable to command signals that emanate from the suprapontine brain. We studied the relations between locomotion (exercise) and phrenic nerve activity and arterial pressure in cats that walked or ran on a treadmill and in animals during fictive locomotion, i.e., locomotor activity in motor nerves to legs. Anesthetized cats with intact brains and unanesthetized decorticated cats were used. All preparations exhibited spontaneous actual and fictive locomotion. Electrical stimulation or microinjection of picrotoxin, a GABA antagonist, of the subthalamic locomotor areas always caused locomotion to develop. Phrenic nerve activity and arterial pressure increased in proportion to the level of locomotor activity despite control or ablation of feedback signals from chemoreceptors and vagal receptors. Similar relations were measured during fictive locomotion despite the absence of muscular contraction and limb movement and the lack of change in metabolic rate. These findings provide experimental support for the central command hypothesis for the genesis of the respiratory hyperpnea and increased cardiovascular function that occur during exercise. We believe that the command signals emanate from the subthalamic locomotor area of the diencephalon.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Neurotoxins that act selectively on voltage-dependent cardiac calcium channels.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We searched for and found a toxin that acts specifically on cardiac calcium channels. This toxin, which we have designated TaiCatoxin (TCX), was purified from the venom of the Australian Taipan snake (Oxyuranus s. scutellatus), one of the world's most poisonous snakes. TCX is a highly charged, basic polypeptide with a molecular weight of 8,000. It blocks high- but not low-threshold cardiac calcium channels in a voltage-dependent manner and has no effect on potassium or sodium channels. The block occurs at nanomolar concentrations, is reversible, and is due to binding at an extracellularly facing site on the channel itself.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Discharge properties of group III and IV muscle afferents: their responses to mechanical and metabolic stimuli.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Static contraction of the hind limb muscles induced by electrical stimulation of the ventral roots has been firmly established to reflexly increase cardiovascular and ventilatory function. Moreover, Group III and IV afferents are known to compose the afferent arm of this reflex arc. The present experiments investigated the discharge properties of Group III and IV afferents whose activation is responsible for the pressor reflex response to static contraction. In general, we found that Group III afferents were more responsive to mechanical stimuli, such as distortion of their receptive fields and tendon stretch, than were Group IV afferents. In contrast, Group IV afferents were more responsive to ischemic contraction than were Group III afferents. In addition, equal percents of Group III and IV afferents were found to be stimulated by increasing interstitial potassium to levels that were similar to those found during muscular contraction. The afferents' response to potassium adapted within seconds, while the interstitial concentration of this ion remained elevated for several minutes. This rapidly adapting response casts doubt on the effectiveness of potassium as the metabolite that signals blood supply and demand in a working muscle are improperly matched.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ionic sensitivity of baroreceptors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Baroreceptors respond to distortion of their receptor regions by producing action potentials and, thus, provide information to the central nervous system for cardiovascular control. The mechanisms converting mechanical events to electrical signals are unknown. Since it has not been possible to record a receptor potential in the mechanosensitive terminals, studies rely on interpretation of axonal discharge of baroreceptor endings. In the present study, the ionic sensitivity of in vitro preparations of both low- and high-pressure receptors are compared in studies in which the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid is controlled. The results taken together with previous work suggest uniformity of response to calcium, sodium, and potassium across a variety of cardiovascular receptor types supporting common mechanoelectrical transduction mechanisms. Decreased extracellular sodium produced increased threshold and decreased slopes of pressure-discharge curves for both aortic arch baroreceptors and for low-pressure baroreceptors in the atrium. Results are consistent with data for other mechanoreceptors where it is believed that distortion activates a relatively poorly selective cation-conducting channel through the membrane. As with arterial baroreceptors, increases in external calcium levels caused a decrease in the excitability of atrial baroreceptors. Substitution of half the external calcium with the inorganic calcium channel blocker cobalt failed to alter baroreceptor function. Bay K 8644, a calcium channel agonist of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, tended to inhibit baroreceptor discharge with effects consistent with smooth muscle activation within the vessel wall. Several hypotheses of potential underlying mechanisms are discussed. These new experiments are consistent with the results achieved with alterations of ionic calcium and suggest that calcium entry does not play a detectable role in baroreceptor transduction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Control of lumbar sympathetic nerve traffic by vagal cardiopulmonary baroreflexes in renal hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Renal nerve traffic is inhibited during volume expansion mainly because of stimulation of vagal cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. These responses are impaired in rabbits with renal hypertension caused by impaired cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. Previous studies have suggested that there may be differences in the extent to which renal hypertension alters reflex control of lumbar as compared with renal sympathetic nerve activity. The goals of this study were to determine if the responses to volume expansion of lumbar sympathetic nerve traffic also are impaired in renal hypertension and if this abnormality, if present, is caused by abnormalities in the vagal cardiopulmonary baroreflex. Experiments were done in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized normotensive (n = 9) and renal hypertensive (n = 7; 1 kidney, 1 wrap) rabbits. Infusion of dextran in saline raised arterial and left atrial pressures in both groups and decreased lumbar nerve traffic by -4.4 +/- 0.4% mm Hg rise in arterial pressure in the normotensive group and by -1.5 +/- 0.1% mm Hg in the hypertensive group (p less than 0.01). These responses were nearly abolished by sinoaortic denervation in both groups. These data indicate that the responses of lumbar nerve traffic to volume expansion are impaired in renal hypertension; this is mainly because of impaired arterial baroreflexes since vagal cardiopulmonary baroreceptors have minimal influence on lumbar nerve traffic, even in normotensive rabbits. These findings for the lumbar nerves are strikingly different from those reported previously for reflex control of the renal nerves in both normotensive and hypertensive rabbits.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Baroreflex control of renal nerve activity in conscious animals.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study quantitates the effect of three different doses of vasopressin on the arterial baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate. The lowest dose of vasopressin (0.4 mU/kg X min), which had no significant effect on resting mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or renal sympathetic nerve activity, increased the inhibitory influence of arterial baroreflexes on renal sympathetic nerve activity in response to an increase in pressure. During infusions of higher doses of vasopressin (1.5 and 3.0 mU/kg X min), which significantly decreased resting heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity but had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, the mean arterial pressure-renal sympathetic nerve activity relation showed a significant decrease in maximum renal sympathetic nerve activity when compared with control. The highest dose of vasopressin resulted in a significant shift of the relation to the left toward lower pressures and in a decrease in maximum gain. The relation exhibited a parallel shift toward lower pressure, with no change in gain, at the higher dose of vasopressin. Based on these results, we conclude that vasopressin exerted a dose-related effect on arterial baroreflex such that lower doses of vasopressin may sensitize the central baroreflex neurons to afferent input, while the higher doses of vasopressin caused direct excitations of these neurons, resulting in a reduction in resting sympathetic outflow.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Beta-adrenergic inotropic responsiveness of patients with heart failure: studies with intracoronary dobutamine infusion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although there is theoretical and indirect evidence to suggest that patients with severe congestive heart failure may have desensitization of myocardial beta-adrenergic responsiveness, there is little direct evidence in patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether myocardial beta-adrenergic inotropic responsiveness is reduced in patients with severe congestive heart failure and markedly elevated plasma norepinephrine levels. To assess myocardial beta-adrenergic inotropic responsiveness, the beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine was infused directly into the left main coronary artery, and the change in +dP/dt was measured as an index of change in inotropic state. Eight patients with severe New York Heart Association functional Class III and IV congestive heart failure were compared with 4 patients without significant congestive heart failure. The increase in +dP/dt at an intracoronary dobutamine infusion rate of 25 micrograms/min in patients with severe congestive heart failure was significantly less than in the patients without heart failure (heart failure, 33 +/- 8%; no heart failure, 69 +/- 12%; p less than 0.05). Although the maximum intracoronary dobutamine infusion rate was substantially higher in patients with heart failure (94 +/- 25 micrograms/min) compared with patients without heart failure (38 +/- 7 micrograms/min), the increase in +dP/dt at maximum infusion rates was also significantly less in patients with heart failure (heart failure, 52 +/- 8%; no heart failure, 93 +/- 24%; p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine concentration was normal in the 4 patients without heart failure and was markedly elevated (range, 307-3,967 ng/l) in the patients with severe heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Norepinephrine kinetics during orthostatic stress in congestive heart failure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To evaluate the determinants of the plasma norepinephrine (NE) response to orthostatic stress, NE kinetics were measured during steady-state infusion of [3H]NE of high-specific activity for two consecutive 90-minute periods; the first was supine, and the second was during 60 degrees head-up tilt. In 6 normal subjects, plasma NE increased from 242 to 570 pg/ml, and NE clearance decreased from 1.43 to 1.00 l/min X M2. In 6 patients with congestive heart failure, there was no significant change in plasma NE during orthostatic stress. This has been interpreted previously to indicate that there was little activation of the baroreflex arc. In fact, NE clearance decreased from 1.08 to 0.79 l/min X M2; however, there was a decrease in NE spillover from 4.04 to 2.88 nmol/min X M2. A reduction of organ blood flow with tilt could be responsible for the reduced NE clearance by both groups, but the mechanism for the reduction in NE spillover with tilt in congestive heart failure is unclear.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Left ventricular sensitivity to beta-adrenoceptor-stimulating drugs in patients with ischemic heart disease and varying degrees of ventricular dysfunction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The left ventricular sensitivity to sympathomimetic amines was assessed in 47 patients with ischemic heart disease and varying degrees of left ventricular dysfunction. Patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to their basal ejection fraction (less than or equal to 35%, between 36 and 54%, and greater than or equal to 55%). After injection of a bolus of isoproterenol (2 micrograms), the isovolumic indexes of inotropic state increased significantly less in patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% than in other patients, but the heart rate changes and the acceleration in the rate of isovolumic pressure fall were comparable in all subgroups. The dose-response curves to cumulative doses of xamoterol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist, confirmed that the magnitude of the inotropic response was reduced during beta 1-stimulation in patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% when compared with patients with a greater ejection fraction. However, the dose of xamoterol necessary to produce 50% of the maximal inotropic response was not increased in patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% (range, 1.5-5.2 micrograms/kg; median 2.5 vs. median values of 2.3 and 3.3 micrograms/kg in the other subgroups; NS), and there was no shift to the right of the dose-response curve. It is concluded that in moderate ischemic heart failure, the magnitude of the inotropic response to isoproterenol or xamoterol is reduced. The absence of shift to the right of the dose-response curve to a beta 1-partial agonist suggests that this alteration in myocardial performance is not primarily caused by a decrease in beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Beat-to-beat changes in atrioventricular nodal excitability and its modulation by concealed conduction during functional 2:1 block in man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An atrial pacing model of functional 2:1 block was used in 10 patients to investigate for the first time the electrophysiologic properties of the human atrioventricular node during intermittent conduction. By varying the terminal portion of the 2:1 atrial train and using the extrastimulus technique, we characterized atrioventricular nodal (AVN) conduction and refractoriness after five different methods of AVN activation: a conducted beat (method I), a conducted beat with omission of the prior blocked beat (method II), a blocked beat (method III), a blocked beat "converted" to one that conducts by omission of the prior conducted beat (method IV), and finally, 1:1 conduction at twice the cycle length of the 2:1 train (control method V). Observed AVN conduction times obeyed the following relationship: method I greater than method II greater than method V, indicating a cumulative effect of concealed penetration by the blocked beats. During 2:1 block, the AVN effective refractory period (ERP) alternated with a mean beat-to-beat difference of at least 100 msec, due mostly to marked ERP abbreviation during AVN activation by method III (vs both 2:1 train cycle length and activation by method V). Concealed penetration by the blocked beat prolonged AVN ERP for the propagated beat (vs that with methods II and V), but to a lesser extent than conduction time was increased. Moreover, the AVN recovery curve with method I was displaced upward and to the right compared with that with methods II to V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hierarchy of levels of ischemia-induced impairment in regional left ventricular systolic function in man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We tested the hypothesis that different subsets of ischemia-induced wall motion disorders are characterized by specific patterns of abnormal regional left ventricular systolic function. Regional contraction was quantitatively assessed from two-dimensional echocardiograms by an automated integrative analysis considering the time course of wall motion during the entire contraction sequence in 20 patients with chronic myocardial infarction, in 13 patients with impending myocardial infarction (less than 2 hr after the onset of symptoms), and in nine patients during transient myocardial ischemia. Wall motion abnormalities were detected in all patients by the integrative analysis. In contrast, the sensitivity for detecting wall motion abnormalities was 80% during chronic infarction, 77% during impending infarction, and 56% during transient ischemia if only end-diastolic and end-systolic frames were compared for assessment of overall regional systolic function. There were distinct differences in the time course of abnormal wall excursion between the three groups. Chronic infarction was characterized by a monophasic contraction pattern, with abnormal synergy in regional contractile events occurring predominantly during early systole. In contrast, transient ischemia caused predominantly mid-to-late systolic abnormal synergy followed by late systolic shortening corresponding to a polyphasic contraction pattern. During impending infarction, an intermediate temporal contraction pattern was present with both early and mesosystolic abnormal synergy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mechanism of mitral regurgitation in patients with myocardial infarction: a study using real-time two-dimensional Doppler flow imaging and echocardiography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms of mitral regurgitation accompanying myocardial infarction. Severity and site of mitral regurgitation was evaluated by the real-time two-dimensional Doppler flow imaging technique in 81 patients with old myocardial infarction. The incidence of mitral regurgitation did not depend on the region of infarction. There was, however, a close relationship between the site of regurgitation and the region of infarction. In patients with mitral regurgitation spurting from the posteromedial area of the valve, the inferior wall was involved in infarction without exception and in some of these patients, the posteromedial papillary muscle was also found to be affected by myocardial infarction; in those with regurgitation spurting from the anterolateral area, the anterior wall showed asynergy. On the other hand in patients with mitral regurgitation spurting from the central area, the region of infarction varied. In these patients, however, the larger the diameter of the mitral anulus, the more severe the grade of regurgitation. The extent of asynergy was another factor related to the severity of mitral regurgitation. Both longitudinally and transversely, broad infarction leads to the enlargement of the mitral anulus. However, even if the mitral anulus is not so dilated, severe involvement of either commissural area results in severe mitral regurgitation from the same commissural side. Thus, there are two major causative factors of mitral regurgitation: (1) asynergy of the papillary muscle or the ventricle that results in mitral regurgitation located in the commissural area of the same side as asynergy, and (2) enlargement of mitral anulus, which results in regurgitation from the central area of the orifice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The transstenotic pressure gradient trend as a predictor of acute complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The transstenotic pressure gradient recorded during coronary angioplasty (PTCA) reflects the dynamic relationship that exists between coronary blood flow and the effective cross-sectional area of the arterial lumen. An apparent relationship between the dynamic behavior of the pressure gradient and subsequent acute vessel closure was observed in our catheterization laboratory. We therefore examined the usefulness of the pressure gradient trend in predicting acute complications after 463 attempted PTCA procedures. Two pressure gradient trend patterns were identified: (1) a rising trend pattern identified by an increasing pressure gradient in the interval after deflation of the angioplasty, and (2) a stable trend pattern identified by a constant or decreasing pressure gradient. The incidence of acute vessel closure (17% vs 4%, p = .0001), emergency CABG (5.6% versus 1%, p less than .05), and myocardial infarction (13% versus 2%, p less than .0001) after the PTCA procedure was significantly higher among patients with rising trend patterns when compared with patients with stable trend patterns. Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors for an acute closure event as rising trend pattern (p less than .001), post-PTCA gradient (p less than .05), and post-PTCA percent diameter stenosis (p less than .02). Independent predictors for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting and myocardial infarction were post-PTCA gradient (p less than .001) and a rising trend pattern (odds ratio = 2.91, p less than .001), respectively. The dynamic behavior of the gradient trend provides additional useful information about the results of dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Predictors of efficacy of amiodarone and characteristics of recurrence of arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and coronary artery disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The value of serial electropharmacologic testing during long-term oral amiodarone therapy for prediction of long-term drug efficacy as well as characteristics of arrhythmia recurrence is controversial. One-hundred four consecutive patients with coronary artery disease and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) underwent initial electrophysiologic (EP) evaluation in the drug-free state and again after an amiodarone loading period of 25 +/- 14 days (mean +/- SD). Twenty-six patients (25%) had no inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmia during therapy with amiodarone (VT control group), whereas arrhythmia inducibility persisted in the remaining 78 patients (VT noncontrol group). During 17.4 +/- 13.7 months of follow-up, two patients in the VT control group either had VT recurrence or died suddenly compared with 21 VT recurrences and eight sudden cardiac deaths in the VT noncontrol group (actuarial event rates at 36 months of 0.11 and 0.56, respectively, p = .0065). The cycle lengths of recurrent VT in these 21 patients in the VT noncontrol group were compared with those observed at final EP testing. A significant linear correlation was demonstrated (r = .76, p = .0001). Subgroup analysis of patients in the VT noncontrol group showed no EP predictors of outcome, including cycle length of induced VT. However, patients dying suddenly during the follow-up period had a higher prevalence of new or worsening congestive heart failure (75%) compared with patients with VT recurrence (19%) or those with no arrhythmic event (29%) (p less than .02).2off</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Electropharmacology of sotalol in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and class III effects of sotalol were assessed in 11 patients with inducible orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia. Serum sotalol concentration, maximum exercise heart rate, and electrophysiologic study data were obtained at control, at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage (407 +/- 149 mg/day, 1.4 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml), and at the maximum well-tolerated dosage (924 +/- 337 mg/day, 3.2 +/- 1.3 micrograms/ml). Class III effects (increases in anterograde and retrograde accessory connection effective refractory periods, ventricular effective refractory period, and the QT interval during fixed-rate atrial pacing) were evident at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage of sotalol and became more marked at the maximum well-tolerated dosage. For example, the mean anterograde accessory connection effective refractory period was significantly increased over control (272 +/- 41 msec) by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker (324 +/- 52 msec) and was further significantly increased by the maximum well-tolerated dose (364 +/- 37 msec). Similarly, the minimum preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation was increased in all patients at each dosage tested. Antiarrhythmic efficacy, defined by the absence of inducible, sustained, orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia and a minimum preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation of 300 msec or greater, was achieved in four patients at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage and in another four patients at the maximum well-tolerated dosage. These eight patients received long-term sotalol therapy and none has had recurrent, sustained reciprocating tachycardia during 15 +/- 12 months of follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Myocardial blood flow during exercise in dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy produced by aortic banding and perinephritic hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study tested the hypothesis that for similar degrees of left ventricular hypertrophy, subendocardial blood flow would be facilitated by the increased diastolic coronary perfusion pressure associated with arterial hypertension, as compared with hypertrophy produced by banding the ascending aorta. Left ventricular hypertrophy was produced with perinephritic hypertension in seven adult dogs and by banding the ascending aorta in nine adult dogs. Left ventricular/body weight ratios were 6.15 +/- 0.59 g/kg in the hypertensive animals and 6.87 +/- 0.47 g/kg in dogs with aortic banding, as compared with 4.23 +/- 0.23 g/kg in seven normal dogs (p less than .01). Studies were performed at rest and during two stages of treadmill exercise to achieve heart rates of 195 and 260 beats/min. Diastolic aortic pressure was increased in animals with hypertension but not in dogs with aortic banding. Systolic ejection period was prolonged in dogs with aortic banding but not in hypertensive dogs. Mean blood flow per gram of myocardium measured with microspheres was similar at rest and during light exercise in all three groups of animals, whereas during heavy exercise blood flow was significantly greater than normal in both groups with hypertrophy. In normal dogs subendocardial/subepicardial (endo/epi) flow ratios did not change significantly during exercise. In both groups with hypertrophy, endo/epi ratios were normal at rest but decreased significantly during exercise. During heavy exercise the endo/epi ratio decreased to 0.73 +/- 0.08 in dogs with aortic banding as compared with 1.07 +/- 0.12 in hypertensive dogs (p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pericardial effusion causes interstitial pulmonary edema in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pulmonary effects of pericardial effusion were studied in eight anesthetized dogs, with emphasis on lung mechanics, O2 exchange, and extravascular thermal lung volume (ETV) accumulation, while warm saline was instilled into the pericardium to elevate pericardial pressure. The results were compared with those from four time-controlled and sham-operated dogs. ETV, as measured by a double-indicator technique, increased from 8.1 +/- 0.8 ml/kg at a pericardial pressure of 0 mm Hg to 12.9 +/- 2.1 ml/kg at 11.0 mm Hg (p less than .01). In the control group, ETV increased from 6.5 +/- 0.7 to 8.2 +/- 0.5 ml/kg over an equal time span. This increase in ETV in the experimental dogs was inversely related to pulmonary compliance, which decreased by 29% as ETV increased (p less than .05), whereas in the time-controlled group of animals it decreased by 8.8%. Arterial PO2 did not deteriorate during the protocol in either group. Histologic examination showed increased interstitial fluid, but neither alveolar fluid nor septal edema, and gravimetric measurements of lung liquid were also consistent with interstitial fluid accumulation in experimental but not control animals. These findings are concordant with the clinical observation that alveolar edema is rarely seen in the presence of pericardial tamponade. Conceivably, progression from interstitial to alveolar edema did not occur both because of the low pulmonary blood flow that occurs as part of pericardial tamponade physiology and/or because the hydrostatic pressures were not elevated enough to produce higher rates of fluid transudation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Two-dimensional ultrasonic tissue characterization: backscatter power, endocardial wall motion, and their phase relationship for normal, ischemic, and infarcted myocardium.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To understand the possible differences in reflected ultrasonic energy from normal, ischemic, and infarcted myocardium, we studied 20 open-chest dogs with a commercially available two-dimensional ultrasonic scanner. Echocardiographic radiofrequency images of anterior myocardium were obtained serially during complete coronary occlusion for 2 hr (n = 15) or 5 hr (n = 10), or after temporary coronary clamping for 15 min with release for 1 hr (n = 5). We investigated two variables: the cyclic backscatter power and the phase difference among endocardial wall motion (EWM), cyclic backscatter power (BSP), and left ventricular pressure (LVP). The cyclic BSP decreased from a control (nonischemic) level of 5.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 dB during ischemia (up to 30 min after coronary ligation). The phase difference between the EWM and BSP progressed from a control (nonischemic) value of 38 +/- 20 to 115 +/- 23 degrees during ischemia. For the infarction period (2 to 5 hr after coronary ligation), the cyclic BSP progressively returned toward baseline control levels to 4.0 +/- 1.2 dB, but the phase had increased further to 170 +/- 28 degrees. The reperfusion study showed a similar decrease in cyclic BSP and an increase in phase after arterial clamping and both returned to near-normal nonischemic values upon arterial release. Simultaneous LVP recordings were performed to assess the phase contribution of endocardial dyskinesis to the total phase difference measurement. At 5 hr the dyskinesis had contributed 46% to the total phase difference, while the backscatter power contributed 54%. However, the EWM contribution occurred immediately while BSP contribution changed progressively during the 5 hr study period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Alterations in endocardial activation of the canine papillary muscle early and late after myocardial infarction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Permanent coronary occlusion produces time-dependent changes in surviving subendocardial cellular properties. We compared the functional alterations in Purkinje (P) and ventricular muscle (VM) activation early (24 hr) and late (4 weeks or greater) after permanent coronary occlusion in an in vitro preparation of canine papillary muscle. High-density extracellular (1 to 2 mm resolution) and selected intracellular recordings were made in five animals early and seven animals late during stimulation of a free-running P strand. Activation patterns of P and VM layers from ischemic and unaffected papillary muscles were compared in the same animal. Average P layer conduction velocity was determined in normal and ischemic regions with the use of a linear array of recording and stimulating electrodes. Purkinje activation was altered little in the early phase of infarction, while healing was associated with a generalized 25% reduction in P layer conduction velocity and localized block and fragmentation of P waveforms. Intracellular recordings at sites of nonsynchronous P activation revealed electrotonic interaction between cell groups. At 24 hr, small groups of VM were present but with abnormal activation patterns in regions of necrosis with fragmented and delayed extracellular waveforms produced by partially uncoupled groups of cells. Local delay and block could be modulated by rate and site of stimulation. After healing, VM activation abruptly stopped at the visual infarct border, marked by a characteristic "end potential." These studies demonstrate important differences in the functional attributes of the P and VM layers studied early and late after coronary occlusion. Alterations in cell-to-cell relationships are likely very important in determining abnormalities of activation in both settings.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Modulation of vascular capacitance by angiotensin and nitroprusside: a mechanism of changes in pericardial pressure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that vasoactive drugs may modify left ventricular diastolic function by shifting blood between the systemic vascular bed and the heart, thereby changing pericardial and left ventricular pressure. The experiments were done in 10 open-chest, anesthetized, previously splenectomized dogs in which changes in pericardial surface pressure in response to intravenous sodium nitroprusside and angiotensin were related to changes in blood volume in the abdominal region. Blood volume was determined by blood pool scintigraphy (99mTc) and regions of interest were drawn in the liver and in the mesenteric area. Angiotensin was infused at rates that were adjusted to increase mean aortic pressure by 20 and 30 mm Hg, and nitroprusside was infused at rates to decrease mean aortic pressure by 30 and 50 mm Hg. Angiotensin increased pericardial pressure by 3 and 5 mm Hg at the respective doses and there were increments in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular diameter (sonomicrometry). Angiotensin decreased blood volume in the mesenteric region by 14% and 17%, but did not significantly change blood volume in the liver region. Angiotensin increased portal venous pressure and decreased mesenteric blood volume, suggesting decreased mesenteric venous compliance. Nitroprusside had opposite effects: pericardial pressure was decreased by 5.5 and 6.5 mm Hg by the respective doses. The doses of nitroprusside increased blood volume in the mesenteric region by 14% and 20%, but did not significantly change blood volume in the liver region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Early and late results of intracoronary arterial stenting after coronary angioplasty in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Intimal dissection with acute closure represents the major complication associated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Intracoronary stent devices offer the possibility of treatment for this sequela. We developed a balloon catheter-mounted, flexible coil stent for use in such cases. To determine the utility of this device and its immediate and long-term influence on arterial patency, 39 mongrel dogs had the stent placed after PTCA of the left circumflex or left anterior descending coronary arteries. Thirteen animals were treated before and after the procedure with warfarin. In this group there were three early deaths associated with stent thrombosis. Twenty-six animals were subsequently treated before and after with aspirin and dipyridamole. There were no early thrombotic events associated with stent placement in these animals. Late arteriographic examination revealed patent vessels in all dogs. Diameter stenosis for warfarin-treated dogs was 8 +/- 5% (mean +/- SD) at 2 months (n = 9), 6 +/- 4% at 6 months (n = 5), and 11 +/- 7% at 12 months (n = 3). Diameter stenosis for aspirin/dipyridamole-treated dogs was 9 +/- 3% at 2 months (n = 8), 8 +/- 5% at 6 months (n = 12), and 5% at 12 months (n = 1). Light and scanning electron microscopic analyses of stented arteries demonstrated incorporation of the stent wires into the arterial wall. Early findings included mild thrombosis localized to areas of wire entrenchment followed by rapid regrowth of endothelial and/or pseudoendothelial cells over trenches, exposed wires, and elastica.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Improvement of postischemic myocardial function and metabolism induced by administration of deferoxamine at the time of reflow: the role of iron in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium has been postulated to result in a specific oxygen radical-mediated component of tissue injury. In a previous study we demonstrated improved recovery of ventricular function and metabolism when the superoxide radical scavenger superoxide dismutase was administered at the time of postischemic reflow. Studies in vitro, have suggested that superoxide toxicity might be mediated via the generation of more reactive hydroxyl radicals in an iron-catalyzed reaction. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that myocardial reperfusion injury might be reduced by administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine at the time of reflow, most likely by preventing hydroxyl radical formation. Sixteen isolated Langendorff rabbit hearts, perfused within the bore of a superconducting magnet, were subjected to 30 min of normothermic (37 degrees C) total global ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion. At reflow eight treated hearts received a 10 ml bolus containing 50 mumol of deferoxamine followed by an infusion of 11 mumol/min for the first 15 min of reflow. The hearts were then perfused with standard perfusate for an additional 30 min. Eight untreated control hearts received a similar bolus of perfusate followed by 45 min of standard reperfusion. Serial 5 min 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded. Myocardial phosphocreatine (PCr) content fell to 5% to 7% of control during ischemia in both groups of hearts. Deferoxamine-treated hearts recovered 99 +/- 10% of control PCr content, while untreated hearts recovered 60 +/- 16% (p less than .05). Intracellular pH fell to 5.9 during ischemia in both groups, before showing more rapid and complete recovery in treated hearts (p less than .01). Recovery of developed pressure reached 70 +/- 6% of control in treated hearts compared with 35 +/- 10% in untreated hearts (p less than .05). Iron content of the perfusate was 7 microM, and by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was in the form of Fe3+-EDTA complexes. In the effluent of treated hearts iron was in the form of Fe3+-deferoxamine chelates. In summary, administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine at the time of postischemic reflow results in greater recovery of myocardial function and energy metabolism, which supports the hypothesis that iron plays an important role in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Salutary action of nicorandil, a new antianginal drug, on myocardial metabolism during ischemia and on postischemic function in a canine preparation of brief, repetitive coronary artery occlusions: comparison with isosorbide dinitrate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of two antianginal drugs, nicorandil and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), on metabolism and function of the ischemic myocardium were studied in a preparation of multiple coronary occlusions in barbital-anesthetized dogs. The preparation consisted of three 5 min occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery interspersed by 30 min of reperfusion. An equihypotensive dose of nicorandil (7.5 micrograms/kg/min) or ISDN (12.5 micrograms/kg/min) was infused 15 min before and during the second occlusion period. Hemodynamics, myocardial segment shortening (%SS), tissue blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were determined throughout. Uptake of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, and lactate were determined during control and ischemic periods. At the end of the final 30 min reperfusion period, biopsy samples of transmural tissue were taken for analysis of phosphocreatine, adenine nucleotides, and total tissue water content. No major hemodynamic changes were produced by either drug except for a 5 to 10 mm Hg decrease in mean aortic pressure. Compared with untreated and ISDN-treated hearts, hearts of dogs treated with nicorandil exhibited reversal of a significant increase in FFA uptake during recurrent ischemia. This was accompanied by an attenuation of the increase in oxygen extraction and CO2 production in the ischemic zone by nicorandil, but not by ISDN. Nicorandil, but not ISDN, improved %SS during reperfusion. Endocardial ATP and total adenine nucleotides were preserved in both nicorandil- and ISDN-treated hearts. Tissue edema was also attenuated by both compounds. Thus, nicorandil improved both function and metabolism during recurrent myocardial ischemia independent of a hemodynamic effect, whereas ISDN only attenuated the loss of adenine nucleotides and increase in tissue water.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The functional border zone in conscious dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Studies focusing on the functional border zone have been performed largely with anesthetized, open-chest preparations. Therefore, we instrumented 14 dogs at sterile surgery with sonomicrometers arrayed to measure systolic wall thickening across the perfusion boundary produced by circumflex coronary occlusion. We fitted sigmoid curves to the data to model the distribution of wall thickening impairment as a function of distance from the perfusion boundary, which was delineated with myocardial blood flow (15 micron diameter microspheres) maps. Using this approach, we defined the functional border zone as the distance from the perfusion boundary to 97.5% of the sigmoid curve's nonischemic asymptote. The lateral extent of the functional border zone, measured 10 min and 3 hr after occlusion, was 32 and 28 degrees of circumference, respectively. To evaluate the severity of nonischemic dysfunction, we measured average systolic wall thickening within the functional border zone. It was reduced from 3.69 +/- 1.10 (mean +/- SD) mm to 2.98 +/- 1.07 mm (p less than .01) and 2.74 +/- 1.12 mm (p less than .01) early and late after coronary occlusion. Thus, a narrow functional border zone was evident during circumflex coronary occlusion in conscious dogs. Its lateral extent was limited to approximately 30 degrees (similar to findings in open-chest, anesthetized dogs), severe dysfunction was restricted to the immediate vicinity of the perfusion boundary, and the average severity of nonischemic dysfunction within the functional border zone was mild.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The physiologic basis of dobutamine as compared with dipyridamole stress interventions in the assessment of critical coronary stenosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Noninvasive cardiac imaging with echocardiography or thallium-201 scintigraphy utilizing pharmacologic agents as alternatives to exercise is gaining popularity. We investigated the physiologic rationale underlying the optimal choice of pharmacologic stress for functional versus perfusion imaging. With the use of an open-chest dog model, a critical stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery was produced with total ablation of hyperemic response to a 15 sec period of complete occlusion. Regional left ventricular wall thickening was assessed by quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by microspheres in both the flow-restricted left circumflex area and the control area supplied by the left anterior descending artery. Eight dogs received 15 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine intravenously for 10 min, and nine dogs received 0.14 mg/kg/min dipyridamole intravenously for 4 min. Dobutamine induced wall thickening abnormalities in all dogs while dipyridamole induced dysfunction in only 55% of the animals studied (p less than .01). Subendocardial blood flow to the left circumflex area was unchanged after both dobutamine and dipyridamole when compared with baseline blood flow. However, subendocardial blood flow increased markedly after dipyridamole in the control area. Regional subendocardial blood flow ratio (left anterior descending/left circumflex) was 3.74 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- SEM) after dipyridamole versus 1.27 +/- 0.09 after dobutamine (p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cooperative mediation by serotonin S2 and thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor activation of cyclic flow variations in dogs with severe coronary artery stenoses.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have reported previously that thromboxane A2/prostaglandin (PG)H2 and serotonin independently mediate the occurrence of cyclic flow variations (CFVs) in a canine preparation of severe coronary artery narrowing. This may be due to an effect of these substances on platelets and/or the vascular wall. We tested the hypothesis that there is a cooperative effect between thromboxane A2/PGH2 and serotonin receptor stimulation in the development of CFVs in this animal preparation. After placement of a hard plastic cylindrical constrictor around the left anterior descending coronary artery, CFVs develop and are characterized by repetitive cycles of declines in coronary blood flow and abrupt increases in flow. In a control group of dogs, CFV frequency (cycles/hour) and severity (lowest coronary blood flow just before its restoration) did not change significantly over a 3 hr interval. In a second group of dogs, CFVs were established after constrictor placement, abolished with the serotonin (5HT2) receptor antagonist ketanserin, and reestablished by the continuous infusion of serotonin into the left atrium. Serotonin-induced CFVs were then abolished with a thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonist, SQ29,548, or a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazoxiben (UK37,248). The relative specificity of the respective antagonists, SQ29,548 and ketanserin, was determined in canine platelets and rat aortic vascular strips. No significant cross-reactivity between ketanserin and SQ29,548 was found. Thus, the data obtained in these studies demonstrate a cooperative interaction between thromboxane A2/PGH2 and serotonin S2 receptors that contributes to the development of CFVs in this experimental preparation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of pyridoxine supplementation on plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels in children with the nephrotic syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Nineteen children with low plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) levels in the nephrotic syndrome due to a variety of histological entities were successfully supplemented with oral pyridoxine hydrochloride. A dose of approximately 2 mg/kg/day of pyridoxine hydrochloride was found to effect adequate plasma PLP levels in most cases. A significant (p less than 0.001) positive correlation (r = 0.83) was found between plasma albumin and PLP levels prior to supplementation and after supplementation both in relapse and remission. Although vitamin B6 repletion led to no demonstrable effect on the clinical course of the syndrome, in view of the possible role which vitamin B6 deficiency may play in defective immune response and thromboembolic phenomena, both being known complications of the nephrotic syndrome, the administration of vitamin B6 supplements is recommended in the active disease state.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Measurement of renal functional reserve of the single kidney in man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The renal functional reserve capacity (RFRC) and response of the single kidney to a low protein diet (LPD) were investigated. Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured using a single injection of I125 Hippuran and Cr51 EDTA during a dopamine infusion (3 micrograms/kg/min) and after 2 weeks on a LPD (0.6 g/kg/day). Dopamine increased ERPF but the associated rise in GFR was not significant. There was a significant decrease in both ERPF and GFR on LPD. The change in GFR during dopamine infusion, but not during LPD, correlated inversely with baseline GFR. Dopamine and LPD had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure and LPD did not alter urinary sodium excretion. These results suggest that the single kidney lacks functional reserve capacity and that protein restriction may be useful in preserving long term function.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Minimal change glomerulonephritis in the elderly--the role of renal biopsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We describe the case histories of three septuagenarians with nephrotic syndrome who would not have been thought likely to have had minimal change disease on clinical grounds. Yet in the three patients all non-sclerosed glomeruli were normal on light microscopy and glomerular immunofluorescence was negative. All three showed a good clinical response to steroids. It is clear from our findings that, in the elderly, clinical criteria are not a reliable guide to renal histology and may lead to a potentially treatable condition, minimal change nephropathy, being overlooked. Because of the high incidence of side effects, a trial of steroids in the elderly is hazardous. From the evidence given we conclude that renal biopsy, in adults with nephrotic syndrome, becomes increasingly useful with advancing age.</ABSTRACT>

- The recurrent transient anterior subluxation (the "dead arm" syndrome) is an accepted clinical syndrome seen most commonly in young athletes or individuals whose arms have been forcefully hyperextended in elevation and external rotation. Care must be taken to differentiate other causes of painful shoulder. With an accurate diagnosis, the results of conservative or operative treatment are most favorable. If surgical treatment is carried out, careful layer-by-layer dissection is required to properly identify and correct anatomic abnormalities.</ABSTRACT>

- Arthroscopy has had a great impact on shoulder surgery by adding another dimension to the surgical anatomy. The present benefits of arthroscopy of the shoulder include the establishment of an accurate diagnosis in the glenohumeral joint, subacromial space, and acromioclavicular joint. Various pathologic entities can be visualized. The efficacy and end results of several arthroscopic surgical procedures are under investigation. Patient selection, the pathologic diagnosis, and end results are important considerations in evaluating newly devised arthroscopic methods of treatment of shoulder syndromes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Suprascapular nerve entrapment. Diagnosis and treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Nine patients were found to have suprascapular nerve entrapment confirmed by electromyographic studies after the diagnosis was suspected. Eight patients who had a surgical release of the suprascapular ligament had good and excellent results. Except in rare cases, a positive electromyogram (EMG) including a delayed nerve conduction (using a coaxial needle) is necessary confirming evidence of the need for surgical treatment. The recommended surgical technique involves detaching the trapezius muscle from the spine of the scapula and opening the space overlying the suprascapular ligament. The trapezius is retracted cephalad while the supraspinatus is retracted caudad. This exposure avoids injury to the spinal accessory nerve and promotes a rapid rehabilitation. Suprascapular nerve entrapment should be suspected and included in the differential diagnosis of ill-defined shoulder pain.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Conservative open anterior acromioplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The records of 29 consecutive patients treated by a pure, open, anterior acromioplasty were reviewed retrospectively. Excluded from consideration were patients with the following pathologic diagnoses or histories: (1) previously attempted acromioplasty on the same shoulder; (2) intraoperatively confirmed rotator cuff tear; (3) any surgically treatable biceps tendon or acromioclavicular abnormality; (4) lost to follow-up study. Three different techniques were employed to perform the acromioplasties. The first technique required partial deltoid origin detachment with an osteotome. The second technique spared the deltoid origin, while again using an osteotome to perform the acromioplasty. The third technique also spared the deltoid origin but used a high-speed burr to perform the acromioplasty. Evaluated in terms of patient satisfaction, residual pain, length of convalescence, suboptimal results, and complications, the first technique proved to be the least effective. The second technique produced early, excellent results. The third technique, in which a burr was employed through an intact deltoid origin, was most effective; technically, the method was also relatively simple and reliable.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percutaneous posterolateral discectomy. Anatomy and mechanism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The evacuation and decompression of the herniated lumbar disc through a sheath inserted dorsolaterally represents a new concept in the treatment of radiculopathy associated with disc herniation. Only a small portion of the spinal nerve before its decent and positioning anterior to the transverse process is subject to insult by an instrument introduced into the intervertebral disc through a posterolateral approach. The chance of injury to the spinal nerve is further minimized when the instruments are introduced a distance of approximately 9-10 cm from the midline, parallel to the vertebral plates, and penetrating the annulus at 10 o'clock or 2 o'clock. The rapid decline of intradiscal pressure after dorsolateral fenestration of the annulus appears to be an important factor in the relief of sciatic pain following percutaneous posterolateral discectomy. The evacuation and decompression of an extruded intervertebral disc with a straight instrument may not be possible. Patients with sequestered disc require laminectomy.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Nonunion is a potential complication of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). There are reports that cite the prevalence of nonunion for two-level ACDF with various fusion techniques, but they do not recommend treatment alternatives. Pseudarthrosis after a two-level ACDF occurred in a 69-year-old man. Posterior cervical wiring and autograft resulted in a successful fusion anteriorly and posteriorly. Posterior fusion augments stability, enhances the potential for eventual anterior fusion, avoids the risks of an additional anterior procedure, and is an excellent therapeutic alternative to a second anterior attempt at stabilization.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of the Wilmington brace on spinal decompensation in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The Wilmington brace is a custom-molded thoracolumbosacral orthosis for decompensated adolescent idiopathic curves. Using the roentgenographic measurement of Rudicel and Renshaw, 71 patients with pretreatment curves that were decompensated greater than 1.0 cm were investigated in detail. The average follow-up period was two years. There was no correlation between pretreatment Cobb angle and the magnitude of spinal decompensation. Pretreatment decompensation averaged 1.9 cm for 22 thoracic curves, 2.5 cm for 32 thoracolumbar-lumbar curves, and 2.4 cm for 17 double-structural curves. Overall, decompensation was improved in 50 patients (70%). Improvement in spinal decompensation averaged 1.4 cm for thoracic, 1.4 cm for thoracolumbar-lumbar, and 1.5 cm for double-structural curves, with decompensation in 27 patients (38%) measuring less than 1.0 cm at follow-up evaluation. An increase in spinal decompensation, averaging 1.2 cm, was found in 6% (one thoracic, two thoraco-lumbar-lumbar, and one double-structural curve). Spinal compensation is favorably influenced in the majority of patients treated with Wilmington brace for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.</ABSTRACT>

Twenty-three patients had good results regardless of the degree of displacement or the presence of an elbow dislocation. One patient, had a poor result due to a technical error in pin placement. The remaining seven patients had the fracture fragment trapped in the joint and did worse, with three poor results. There was no correlation between range of motion and degree of displacement, length of immobilization, time from injury to surgery, presence of a dislocation, or open versus percutaneous treatment. Operative treatment of medial epicondyle fractures displaced greater than 2 mm gave consistently good results with a good range of motion, good stability, no ulnar nerve symptoms, and no deformity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ischemic necrosis of the femoral head. Correlation of magnetic resonance imaging and histologic sections.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Magnetic resonance (MR) images were correlated with matched histologic sections of a resected ischemic necrotic femoral head and neck. Preoperative radiographs had revealed Stage 3 ischemic necrosis. Preoperative MR images disclosed foci of abnormally low signal intensity alternating with normal-appearing foci of high signal intensity. Surgical resection of the femoral head and neck was followed by MR imaging and pathologic sectioning, fixation, and staining, enabling the individual sections to be compared with the postoperative MR slices. A subchondral focus of diminished signal intensity was shown to represent saponified fat and consisted of a transudate of proteinaceous material with probable calcifications. The subjacent region of normal, high signal intensity represented "mummified" fat. The next lower stratum of diminished signal intensity was composed of fibrous and vascular tissues and histiocytic infiltrates that had extensively or completely replaced the fatty marrow.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Survey of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in adults undergoing hip surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) is the most common and potentially the most serious immediate postoperative complication of hip surgery. Prophylaxis of VTED remains controversial and its practice is widely variable. Since the last survey of VTED prophylaxis as practiced by American orthopedists, published in 1974, the literature has expanded tremendously and the number of orthopedists has doubled. The authors surveyed 10% of American orthopedists and the chiefs of training programs and/or major teaching hospitals to assess current practices. The average practicing orthopedist responding was 44-years-old and had performed 17.6 total hip arthroplasties and treated operatively 30.6 hip fractures per year during the last five years. The average responding chief surgeon, was 49 years old and had performed 49 total hip arthroplasties and treated operatively 20.5 hip fractures per year during the last five years. Most surgeons use pharmacologic prophylaxis or external pneumatic compression for total hip arthroplasty patients (84.4%) and hip fracture patients (74%). Warfarin has been tried and abandoned by 50% of all respondents, largely because of bleeding complications. Aspirin was the most popular agent. However, more than 25% of the respondents stated that at least one of their patients who had elective total hip arthroplasties had died of pulmonary embolism during the last five years.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Delayed postbacteremic prosthetic joint infection.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Deep infection of a prosthetic joint is a devastating complication. One proposed mechanism of late prosthetic joint infection involves hematogenous spread from an extraarticular focus of infection. Two cases clearly demonstrate hematogenously acquired prosthetic joint infections, one caused by Clostridium perfringens and the other by Streptococcus pneumoniae. These cases were unusual in that a long asymptomatic period intervened between the primary bacteremic illness and the subsequent prosthetic infection. Patients with prosthetic joints who develop bacteremic infection at extraarticular sites should be treated promptly and aggressively with appropriate antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics should be strongly considered in the patient with a prosthetic joint who undergoes procedures likely to be associated with a bacteremia. Transient arthralgias at the time of bacteremia may represent the onset of the joint infection and should not be overlooked or attributed a priori to the patient's underlying arthritic or medical condition.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The clinical relevance of instrumented testing for ACL insufficiency. Experience with the UCLA clinical knee testing apparatus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An instrumented clinical testing device developed at UCLA records a continuous anteroposterior force versus displacement curve of the tibia with respect to the femur at 20 degrees of flexion. Laxity and stiffness are calculated from the response curve. With this device, 95% of normal knees have an anterior laxity less than 7.5 mm and a side-to-side difference less than 2 mm. In contrast, an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) absent knee has a mean anterior laxity of 10 mm and a mean side-to-side difference of 5 mm. In a small group of patients with an intraarticular ACL substitution using the medial or lateral one-third of the patellar tendon, laxity and stiffness of the injured knees were returned to within the normal range and remained constant three years after surgery. In a group of 76 patients treated with ACL substitution using the torn meniscus, 51% of the patients still had an anterior laxity outside the normal range 3.5 years after surgery. In a preliminary study of 19 patients receiving a Gore-Tex synthetic ACL substitution, 55% of the patients still had a side-to-side difference greater than 2 mm two years after the procedure. These studies illustrate the advantages of impartial, objective measurements of knee stability. Laxity and stiffness values can supplement, but never replace, a thorough patient examination and patient history. As sports medicine matures as a scientific discipline, improved instrumented test devices may ultimately provide a standardized means for reporting knee stability parameters.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The relationship between dead arm syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A relationship exists between anterior shoulder subluxation and thoracic outlet syndrome that is responsible for the more florid symptoms of dead arm syndrome (DAS) in some patients. This relationship was demonstrated in eight of 27 patients (30%) in a consecutive series of Bankart operations for treatment of subluxation. The mechanism is associated with a disturbance in the kinesiology of the shoulder-joint complex that alters the position of the scapula relative to the rib cage and neurovascular supply to the upper limb. Therapy is directed toward restoration of the stability of the glenohumeral joint so that normal biomechanics can be reestablished. In advanced stages of thoracic outlet syndrome, however, DAS may initially require surgical decompression of the nerves and vessels. Careful attention to postural mechanics is essential for rational diagnosis and treatment of DAS.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Femoral component geometry. A factor in total hip arthroplasty durability.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The theoretically conceived geometric design for femoral components, including a longer length, an extended width, and a stiffer modulus, is expressed in the clinical design of the Buck-32 prosthesis. This prosthesis was used in 110 patients with 122 hip arthroplasties between 1975 and 1979, giving a follow-up period of five to nine years (average, 7 years). Femoral loosening requiring revision surgery occurred in 2.3% of the patient population. Radiolucencies were noted in 24% of the cases but were progressive in only 17%. Complications were minimal, as were bone changes about the prosthetic units. There is clinical evidence in the literature, substantiated by this study, that geometric design does influence the durability of a cemented femoral component.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A method of determining the angular malalignments of the knee and ankle joints resulting from a tibial malunion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Malalignments of the knee and ankle joints resulting from tibial angular malunion can be determined using mathematical analysis. The angular deformity of the tibia is equal to the sum of the angular malalignments formed by the knee and ankle joints in relation to the horizontal plane. These malalignments are not equal. A larger percentage of the deformity is reflected inferiorly as the deformity approaches the ankle joint. A table was formulated to provide the corresponding degrees of joint malalignment (knee and ankle) for tibial angular deformities at different positions along the tibia. The analysis provides a useful tool to quantify the knee and ankle joint malalignments secondary to tibial angular malunion. Although designation of prognosis at different degrees of angular deformity is beyond the scope of this study, it does provide improved correlation between tibial angular deformities and the clinical outcome, e.g., degenerative arthroses of the adjacent joints, in future studies on tibial fractures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Total knee arthroplasty following patellectomy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Eleven patients with a previous patellectomy and primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) had chart reviews, recent clinical examinations, evaluation of roentgenograms, rating of knee arthroplasty on a standard scale, and quantitation of quadriceps and hamstring torque using an isokinetic dynamometer. Good to excellent results were present in only five of the 11 knees studied, compared with 11 of 11 patients in a control group with intact patellae. Quadriceps and hamstring torque and strength were diminished relative to the control groups. Factors that correlated with a success or failure of TKA in patients with previous patellectomy included: number of previous knee operations, three or less; presence of severe arthritic changes roentgenographically; and quadriceps performance of greater than 40 ft-lb at 30 degrees/second testing speed. Patients without patellae who lack these favorable prognostic factors for a successful TKA should be strongly considered for bracing or primary arthrodesis, rather than knee arthroplasty.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Contralateral compensation with knee impairment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Knee motion of four healthy teenagers was unilaterally impaired by means of cast braces. Computerized analysis from video recording of walking was used to study the compensatory effects and to compare them with six patients. Restricted knee flexion caused little change in stance-phase knee motion on the restricted side. The unimpaired knee displayed exaggerated stance phase flexion and phase shifts, which in turn produced pelvic vaulting. The forces on the braces were high. Impairments to extension produced bilateral crouch without loss of flexion extension patterns within the limits of the impairment. Fatigue was more prominent than with blocks to flexion. Circumduction was found to be overrated as a compensation for stiff-leggedness. Lateral shift to the well side, combined with freezing of the well-side stance adduction, was a frequently used effective clearance mechanism. Phasic changes in motion of many body parts may combine to produce low-level pelvic displacement, especially when clinical weakness is present. Shortened stride length is the most sensitive indicator of this phenomenon. Graphs of individual joint motion do not easily convey the important phasic relationships that are fundamental to that motion and to the interpretation of its effects. Stick figures were better for analysis of this aspect of motion analysis, even though they are more subjective.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Limited posterolateral surgical approach to the knee for excision of osteoid osteoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An 18-year-old man suffered four years of undiagnosed knee pain until a CAT scan revealed an epiphyseal osteoid osteoma of the tibia located subchondrally, just medial to the proximal tibiofibular joint. A nidus in this location is not easily accessible, and its proximity to the joint surface raised concerns about damage to the tibial plateau. To facilitate excision of the tumor, cadaveric dissections were performed to develop a limited posterior approach to the proximal, lateral portion of the tibia. The CAT scan was used to calculate the precise dimensions of the tumor and its relation to the posterior tibial cortex and the proximal tibiofibular joint. With the use of the exposure developed in the laboratory and the calculations derived from the CAT scan, the tumor could be excised by removing a single block of bone 15 mm3. Intraoperative radiographs confirmed the presence of the nidus within the excised block of bone. This case report reaffirms the frequent difficulties and tardiness in diagnosing osteoid osteomas and the need to include these tumors in the differential diagnosis of knee pain and epiphyseal lesions. Before CAT scans were used, the working diagnoses were torn meniscus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and bone hemangiomatosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Destructive monarticular arthritis secondary to anticoagulant therapy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hemarthrosis secondary to anticoagulant therapy is a well-known clinical problem. The pathologic process usually occurs in large joints and is reversible with the discontinuation of the anticoagulant medication. The condition presented for consideration here is unusual for two reasons. First, it is relatively uncommon for the ankle joint to be involved. Second, the destructive arthritis progressed after the medication was discontinued. Resting the involved joint until symptoms subside is often adequate treatment for anticoagulant-induced hemarthrosis. In an 84-year-old man, an arthrodesis was necessary to achieve a symptom-free ankle joint. Hemarthrosis secondary to anticoagulant medication may not be a benign disease process.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Medical and economic parameters of motorcycle-induced trauma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective study was conducted on all patients injured in a motorcycle accident who were admitted to the authors' institution during a one-year period. The 71 patients evaluated averaged 26 years of age; 79% were men, 75% were not wearing a helmet, and 24% were legally intoxicated. Sixty-six percent required surgical intervention and 36% a second procedure. There were 167 fractures, with an average of 2.4 per patient. The 27 patients requiring a blood transfusion averaged 10.5 units per patient. Motorcyclists not wearing a helmet had an increased risk of head injury (p less than .01). Those with head injuries had an increased need for intensive care (p less than .0001) and a ventilator (p less than .001). Patients with head injuries more commonly sustained fractures about the shoulder (p less than .015) than fractures to the lower extremity (p less than .005). The average hospital stay was 13 days, with a cost of $16,408 per patient. The cost was significantly higher in patients with a head injury ($21,945) than in patients without a head injury ($11,941). Patients sustaining a head injury were less likely to return to baseline functioning (p less than .001).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Postoperative course of patients treated with iliac osteocutaneous free flaps. A two- to five-year follow-up study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical and radiologic course was reviewed in seven patients treated with an iliac osteocutaneous free flap (iliac flap) for treatment of large bone defects in the tibia and first metacarpal bone and overlying skin. Application of the iliac flap was followed by free bone grafting in four patients and aesthetic surgery in four patients. All patients obtained solid bony union and good skin coverage; none had complaints upon walking. An iliac flap was useful as a salvage procedure for the treatment of massive defect of bone and skin in extremities, especially in the lower one-third of the lower leg. Transient osteoporosis occurred before osteosclerosis and bony union. Bone remodeling with change in the trabecular pattern preceded transformation from cancellous to cortical bone.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Behavior of an external fixation frame incorporating an angular separation of the fixator pins. A finite element approach.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A finite element model has been developed to simulate the deformation that occurs at the fracture site of an externally fixed bone as a result of applied bending, compression, and torsional loads. The pin configuration in this model is constructed to allow an angular separation of the fixator pins. The mechanical effect of this angular separation and of the distribution of the pins along the fixator bar is examined. The model shows that an angular separation of the pins provides a more symmetric deformation of the fracture site when a bending load is applied in different directions to the bone and thereby protects a fracture from excessive movement in any direction. The torsional stability of an external fixation frame is considerably increased by incorporating an angular separation of the pins. The model also shows that the most stable configuration for the fixator uses a wide separation of the pins along the fixator bar.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Management of open fractures with sterilization of large, contaminated, extruded cortical fragments.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The literature provides surprisingly little guidance for the management of Grade III open fractures with large extruded segments of long bones. A 10-cm segment of femoral diaphysis was reimplanted successfully in a 24-year-old man with a comminuted segmental open fracture. For basic information, laboratory studies were performed to determine the relative efficacies of various methods of sterilization of contaminated bovine metatarsals. Bovine bone segments were given one of the following treatments: (1) saline rinse; (2) povidone-iodine scrub/saline rinse; (3) povidone-iodine scrub/autoclaving; (4) povidone-iodine scrub/thimerosal immersion; (5) povidone-iodine scrub/povidone-iodine immersion; or (6) chlorhexidine gluconate scrub antibiotic solution immersion. The segments were then cultured. Only the povidone-iodine/autoclave and chlorhexidine gluconate/orthopedic antibiotic solution treatments were 100% effective in eliminating bacterial growth. Contaminated extruded segments of long bones can be adequately sterilized for reimplantation by surgical cleansing with chlorhexidine gluconate followed by brief soaking in antibiotic solution.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Optimum pore size for bone cement fixation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The interface shear properties of porous coated Ti-6Al-4V alloy embedded in bone cement were examined as a function of pore size. Cylindric Ti-6Al-4V alloy push-out specimens were coated with two layers of spheric powders having particle size ranges of 297-420 microns, 420-500 microns, 595-707 microns, and 850-1400 microns. Sintering resulted in mean pore sizes of 165, 285, 345, and 550 microns, respectively, and porosities in the range of 40%-44%. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean pore sizes obtained from the four particle size ranges. There were no differences between the mean porosities. The porous-coated specimens were embedded in bone cement and mechanical push-out testing was performed. Non-coated specimens having a satin surface finish were also embedded in bone cement and tested. The noncoated metal specimens displayed an interface shear strength of 4.2 +/- 0.4 MPa, whereas the shear strengths for the porous-coated specimens were significantly higher and increased as pore size increased. The mean interface shear strengths determined were 17.0 +/- 2.1 MPa (165 microns pore size), 18.1 +/- 2.3 MPa (285 micron pore size), 23.6 +/- 1.7 MPa (345 microns pore size), and 25.4 +/- 3.4 MPa (550 microns pore size). Significant differences in shear strength for the porous-coated specimens were found between the two smaller particle sizes and the two larger particle sizes. As pore size increased from 285 microns to 345 microns, a statistically significant increase in shear strength from 18.1 MPa to 23.6 MPa was observed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Osteoid osteoma of the femoral neck stimulating an inflammatory synovitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The case report presents a nine-year-old child with an osteoid osteoma of the femoral neck, simulating an inflammatory synovitis. Osteoid osteoma is a common benign bone tumor. However, when intracapsular lesions occur they may pose a diagnostic challenge. Nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms, such as inflammatory synovitis, joint effusion, and soft tissue swelling, may pose a problem in diagnosis and treatment. The delay in diagnosis can range from six months to two years. When the hip is involved, the patient may have nonspecific pain, limp, restricted motion, and thigh atrophy. An accurate diagnosis may be difficult to elicit, requiring detailed history and physical examination and culminating in the use of computed tomography.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Rotator interval lesion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Arthrography and surgical exploration reveal the pathogenesis of a painful shoulder syndrome characterized by inferior instability in the rotator interval (RI). The RI is the space between the subscapularis and the adjacent supraspinatus interval. Two types of RI lesions can be identified. Type I, a contracted state, is characterized by inflammatory changes in superficial bursal area. In Type II, an unstable condition is associated with extensive inflammation of deeper tissues in the RI. In a series of 101 patients, including 106 shoulders with RI lesions, surgical repair of the RI was performed with the shoulder in an externally rotated position. This position ensured a close fit of the supraspinatus and the subscapularis attachments. Of 78 shoulders evaluated in a follow-up study, 96% were graded good or excellent, and 4% poor. This investigation presents evidence for the importance of diagnosis and treatment of RI lesions in patients with persistent pain in the shoulder.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Incomplete thickness rotator cuff tears diagnosed by subacromial bursography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Incomplete thickness rotator cuff tears (ITRCT) adjacent to the bursal sac were diagnosed preoperatively by subacromial bursography and confirmed by surgical exposure. There were five men and one woman with an average age of 41.8 years. The preoperative duration of shoulder pain ranged from four to 36 months (average, 15.8 months). Clinical manifestations included crepitus and a painful arc in five of the six cases. Glenohumeral arthrography was normal in all cases. Subacromial bursography, subsequently performed, revealed pooling of the contrast medium in a torn area of the bursal side of the rotator cuff in all cases. Surgical treatment was recommended after the failure of conservative treatment for three to ten months. The surgical treatment consisted of both anterior acromioplasty and tendon suture. Wedge resection and shoelace suture repair of the tendon produced satisfactory results in all cases followed for ten to 72 months (average, 44.3 months). ITRCT adherent to the bursal sac were noted in 2.4% of a cadaver survey. Subacromial bursography can be a useful diagnostic procedure for this specific entity in subacromial impingement syndrome.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The differentiation between the stiff and painful shoulder without any joint capsule involvement and with capsule involvement (true adhesive capsulitis) must be established before a rational treatment can be prescribed. Arthrography establishes the correct diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Treatment of the stiff and painful shoulder is through prevention and exercise. The treatment of adhesive capsulitis includes prevention, exercises, manipulation, and capsulotomy. Each treatment method is determined by specific criteria. Arthroscopy is not useful for either diagnosis or treatment of adhesive capsulitis but may be useful for recognition of the four stages of the disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A functional analysis of shoulder fusions.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seventeen shoulder fusions with relatively normal musculature were analyzed with particular interest to the ability of the fused extremity to perform activities of daily living. Joints fused for paralysis were excluded. No patient was able to work overhead or with arms abducted as required for activities such as hammering, house painting, or climbing a ladder. Many patients had difficulty functioning at head level for hygienic purposes. Many were unable to perform functions behind the back, although waist-level function approached normal. The position of rotation was the most critical factor in approaching optimum function. Fusions in positions of internal rotation reduced the ability to comb hair, wash the face, or to otherwise use the hand at head level. Fusion in a position of excessive external rotation made it impossible for the patient to reach the opposite axilla or belt buckle. There was a range of acceptability of abduction of forward flexion that did not appear to compromise the eventual functional result. The recommended position is 25 degrees to 40 degrees abduction, 20 degrees to 30 degrees flexion, and 25 degrees to 30 degrees of internal rotation. Even at the ideal position, shoulder fusion produces significant limitations in function. For patients with painful, nonfunctional shoulders who need arthrodesis, these limitations should be clearly discussed, along with the pros and cons of surgical treatment in general.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The natural history of night terrors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Night terrors are a sleep disorder, resulting from a partial arousal during slow-wave sleep. They usually occur within 2 hours of sleep onset and are characterized by agitation and unresponsiveness to external stimuli. Nineteen children (ten males, nine females) with onset of night terrors before age 7.5 years were studied by means of a questionnaire. Mean observation time (time from onset age to age at survey) was 8.5 years, but longer than 10 years in nine subjects. Seventy percent of the children had their initial frequency of night terrors as their peak frequency, with a tendency for shorter duration of the parasomnia in this group. Children with onset age less than 3.5 years may be expected to attain a peak frequency of at least one episode per week. Children with onset after 3.5 years, but before 7.5 years, may expect to attain a peak frequency of 1-2 episodes per month. There was a mean duration of 3.9 years, with a tendency for longer duration in children with positive family histories of sleep walking. Fifty percent stopped by age 8 years; 36 percent continued into adolescence. No common abnormal behavioral profile or psychopathology was found. Common precipitants of attacks were not identified.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Family interactions surrounding feedings of infants with nonorganic failure to thrive.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Family interactional processes surrounding infant feedings in 34 consecutive cases of nonorganic failure to thrive (NFT) admitted to a university teaching hospital are reported. Observations of family interactions for 90 minutes, including one feeding, yielded clinically useful information not readily available from other sources. Behaviors that supported inadequate feedings were reliably identified in 79 percent of the families. Failure of mothers to appropriately respond to their infants' cues, coupled with few signs of emotional attachment, were present in only 26 percent of cases, and inadequate child-care knowledge and skills in only 6 percent. Thus, widely held conceptual models explained perpetuation of inadequate feedings in only 32 percent of cases. Instead, sibling rivalry, displaced maternal anger, and undermined mother were among the problems found. Assessments of family members' interactions surrounding feedings have the potential to enhance the current management of NFT.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- 1. Studies were prospectively performed on 72 hospitalized patients with essential hypertension. Blood pressure was normalized within 1 week of admission in 33 patients (group I), but did not decrease in 39 patients (group II). To determine the factors that differentiate group I from group II, cardio-renal haemodynamic and endocrinological indices were evaluated using multivariate analysis. 2. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures on admission were higher in group II (P less than 0.001), whose optic fundi showed more severe changes (P less than 0.001). Although group II had greater left ventricular posterior wall thickness (P less than 0.02), left ventricular mass index (P less than 0.05) and systemic vascular resistance (P less than 0.01) on echocardiography, their cardiac index and ejection fraction were comparable with those of group I. 3. Renal blood flow (P less than 0.05) and glomerular filtration rate (P less than 0.01) were lower in group II than in group I. Renal vascular resistance was more elevated (P less than 0.01) in group II than in group I. 4. After severe sodium depletion and ambulation, group I showed a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline (P less than 0.05). On multivariate analysis, those with lower systolic blood pressure, better renal function and more reactive sympathetic nervous system were discriminated as group I. 5. These data suggest that group I patients have lower systolic blood pressure on admission, greater sympathetic reactivity and better renal function, all of which contribute to their spontaneous blood pressure fall after admission.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- 1. The urine dopamine response to intravenous frusemide (30 mg) was investigated in 15 salt replete male volunteers. The effects of oral indomethacin (100 mg) and oral carbidopa (100 mg) given before intravenous frusemide were studied in the same group of subjects. 2. Frusemide produced a significant increase in urine dopamine output within 15 min. 3. Indomethacin attenuated the natriuretic and renin responses to frusemide, but did not alter urine dopamine output. 4. Carbidopa lowered urine dopamine to undetectable levels, but did not significantly affect the natriuretic and renin responses to frusemide. 5. We conclude that urine dopamine excretion after frusemide is not directly related to increased sodium excretion or renin response and it is not mediated by the prostaglandins. In addition, dopamine does not contribute to the renal actions of frusemide under normal conditions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fatty acid synthesis and triacylglycerol accumulation in rat liver after chronic ethanol consumption.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. Liver slices from chronically alcohol-fed rats incubated with 3H2O showed less than half the fatty acid synthesis rates of pair-fed controls. Addition of 50 mmol/l ethanol or of 10 mmol/l lactate and 1 mmol/l pyruvate to the incubation medium did not alter the fatty acid synthesis rates in either groups. Hepatic fatty acid synthesis rates measured in vivo with 3H2O were also significantly reduced in alcohol-fed rats. 2. Time-course experiments showed that after 1 week on the ethanol diet hepatic fatty acid synthesis rates in vitro were similar to control rats, although the liver triacylglycerol content was significantly increased. From the second week of feeding, fatty acid synthesis rates were significantly lower in alcohol-fed rats and the liver triacylglycerol content progressively increased compared with controls. 3. Fatty acid synthase activity in liver cytosolic fractions were similar to controls in the alcohol-fed group after 1 week of feeding but were significantly lower in alcohol-fed rats from the second week onwards. 4. These results indicate that hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation after alcohol feeding is not due to increased fatty acid synthesis. The reduced fatty acid synthesis observed is a consequence of triacylglycerol accumulation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Permeability of the rat small intestine to carbohydrate probe molecules.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. Absorption of carbohydrate probe molecules from ligated loops of rat small intestine was studied. Absorption was determined by measuring recovery of molecules in the urine, corrected for incomplete recovery after intravenous injection, and was examined for correlation with several parameters of molecular dimension. 2. Absorption depended on molecular volume rather than relative molecular mass, molecular radius or molecular area. 3. Molecules with a molecular volume below 225 X 10(-3) nm3 were absorbed to a greater extent than larger molecules, and absorption was affected critically by molecular volume, small changes in volume producing considerable variation in absorption. 4. Absorption of larger molecules was not affected by changes in volume within the range 362 X 10(-3)-1128 X 10(-3) nm3. 5. These findings support the concept that there are at least two aqueous diffusion pathways across the intestinal mucosa. small molecules diffusing through a small channel of finite dimension, compatible with a transcellular aqueous pore, whilst large molecules diffuse through a less frequent pathway of considerably larger dimensions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Disturbance of acid-base balance in the young spontaneously hypertensive rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. The acid-base status of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was compared with that of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) in the steady state, after acid loading and after blood pressure had been maintained at normal levels from weaning. Whole blood ionized calcium was measured simultaneously. 2. In the prehypertensive stage (4 weeks of age), plasma bicarbonate was significantly lower in SHR than in WKY, while blood pH did not differ significantly. 3. After 6 weeks of age, blood pH and plasma bicarbonate were significantly lower in both anaesthetized and conscious SHR than in corresponding WKY. After 7 days administration of NH4Cl in the drinking fluid, both parameters decreased significantly in both strains and the difference in pH remained constant (0.05 pH unit, P less than 0.01). 4. In none of the groups investigated did non-pH-adjusted ionized calcium differ significantly between the SHR and WKY. 5. Prevention of the development of hypertension in SHR by hydralazine treatment from weaning did not increase pH or bicarbonate compared with untreated SHR, indicating that the metabolic acidosis in the SHR was not a consequence of raised blood pressure. 6. Disturbance in acid-base balance may be involved in the pathogenesis of raised blood pressure in this animal model of genetic hypertension.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Measurement of secretion in nasal lavage.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. The amount of admixture in nasal lavage fluids was determined by addition of 99mTc labelled albumin, providing a correction factor for measurements of cellular material and humoral substances in nasal lavage return as well as a quantitative measure of nasal secretions. 2. Albumin was chosen as marker molecule, since only negligible amounts were absorbed or adsorbed to the mucosa during the nasal lavage. 3. Labelling of the albumin with 99mTc ensured an accuracy of measurements only limited by the precision of the weighing. The isotope allowed for the determination of the amount of admixed secretion to be carried out on the whole sample of lavage fluid, thereby avoiding the necessity of complete admixture between marker and lavage fluid which would be pertinent to marker molecules measured chemically. The radiation from a nasal lavage is minimal and the procedure is fully acceptable for repeated use in humans. 4. The nasal lavage technique adopted allowed the return of 99.2% (median value) of the instilled volume. The area irrigated was visualized on a gamma-camera, and was demonstrated to cover an area larger than the area reached by challenge from a pumpspray, i.e. a large part of the nose, yet not the oropharynx. 5. A dose related increase in nasal secretion harvested by the nasal lavage in 10 persons challenged with histamine chloride could be demonstrated by this technique. 6. It is concluded that the use of 99mTc-albumin in a nasal washing provides a safe, simple and quick method for determination of the admixed nasal secretion with a remarkable degree of accuracy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Deferoxamine-induced bone changes in haemodialysis patients: a histomorphometric study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. The histological effects of deferoxamine therapy were assessed on transiliac bone biopsies taken after double tetracycline labelling from 16 uraemic patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis, all having aluminium deposits in bone. Eight patients had osteomalacia, five had an "aplastic" bone lesion and three a high bone turnover with a marked increase in osteoid volume. 2. Deferoxamine was administered intravenously once a week at doses ranging from 1 to 6 g for a mean duration of 7.6 +/- 3.3 (SD) months. 3. Deferoxamine therapy was associated with significant reductions in stainable aluminium deposits, osteoid volume, osteoid surfaces and thickness index of osteoid seams. The osteoblastic osteoid surfaces as well as the bone formation rates also increased significantly. 4. A rise in resorption parameters and in serum parathyroid hormone levels was observed in patients with osteomalacia. The percentage reductions in stainable aluminium and in osteoid volume were correlated with the degree of hyperparathyroidism. 5. These data show that deferoxamine therapy reduces stainable bone aluminium and improves bone mineralization in low turnover osteomalacia and that the presence of hyperparathyroidism is associated with an increased response to deferoxamine therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Relationship between hepatic levels of glutathione and sulphobromophthalein retention in hyperthyroidism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. Sulphobromophthalein (BSP) retention and liver glutathione levels were studied in uncomplicated hyperthyroid patients. 2. BSP retention was increased in 52.5% of the subjects at admission (n = 40) and in 28% of the cases after 3 months of propylthiouracil treatment (300-400 mg/day) (n = 25). 3. Hepatic levels of glutathione were measured in six patients and significant inversed power correlation with BSP retention was observed (r = 0.968, P less than 0.001). 4. These data support the contention that the alteration of the BSP retention observed in hyperthyroidism could be due to a decreased availability of hepatic glutathione for conjugation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evidence for large intestinal control of potassium homoeostasis in uraemic patients undergoing long-term dialysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. The role of the large intestine in the maintenance of K+ balance in uraemic patients established on long-term dialysis was studied with a rectal dialysis technique in 14 normal subjects, ten normokalaemic patients undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and seven patients undergoing haemodialysis. Dietary K+ intakes in the normal subjects, CAPD patients and haemodialysis patients were 80-100 mmol/24 h, 70-80 mmol/24 h and 60-70 mmol/24 h, respectively. 2. At an initial intraluminal K+ concentration of 45 mmol/l, rectal K+ secretion in the CAPD patients (2.4 +/- 0.4 mumol h-1 cm-2) was greater than in normal subjects (1.2 +/- 0.2 mumol h-1 cm-2, P less than 0.02). Under similar conditions, rectal K+ secretion was also greater in the haemodialysis patients than in normal subjects, both predialysis (3.7 +/- 0.4 mumol h-1 cm-2, P less than 0.001) and postdialysis (2.4 +/- 0.5 mumol h-1 cm-2, P less than 0.05), even though haemodialysis decreased plasma K+ concentration from 5.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/l to 3.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (P less than 0.001). 3. There were no significant differences in rectal Na+ absorption, rectal potential difference, plasma aldosterone concentration, or total body K+ content (measured by whole-body counting of 40K), between the normal subjects and either the CAPD or the haemodialysis patients. 4. These results indicate that K+ homoeostasis is maintained in uraemic patients undergoing long-term dialysis by a combination of K+ losses during dialysis, and enhanced large intestinal K+ excretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of the sympathetic nervous system and vasopressin on the blood pressure lowering effect of nifedipine in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. The role of the sympathetic nervous system and the effect of vasopressin (AVP) on the hypotensive action of nifedipine (Nf) were evaluated in conscious, unrestrained normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. 2. The hypotensive response to Nf was much greater in DOCA rats than in the controls. 3. Solitary blockade of the sympathetic nervous system or AVP, did not alter the Nf effect in either DOCA or control rats. However, a combination clearly diminished the effect of Nf in the DOCA group, but enhanced it in the controls. The inhibition of angiotensin II (ANG II) augmented the hypotensive effect of Nf in control animals, but not in the DOCA rats. The percentage fall in blood pressure with Nf was much the same in both groups after the combined inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system and AVP. 4. The enhanced hypotensive action of Nf in DOCA rats may be dependent on the hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and AVP, which facilitates calcium influx, and in the normotensive animals the depressor response to Nf may relate to blockade of the calcium influx, independent of the sympathetic nervous system, AVP and ANG II.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effects of posture on abnormalities of forearm venous tone in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. Forearm venous tone was measured in the left lateral supine position and in response to passive leg elevation in a group of women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and compared with a group of normotensive pregnant women and a group of non-pregnant women. 2. The women with pregnancy-induced hypertension were venoconstricted in the supine position compared with the normal pregnant women (P less than 0.002). There was no difference in forearm venous tone between the women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and the non-pregnant women. 3. In response to passive leg elevation the women with pregnancy-induced hypertension venodilated (P less than 0.002) whereas there was no change in forearm venous tone in the normotensive pregnant women and the non-pregnant women. There was no change in blood pressure in any of the women after 35 min of leg elevation. 4. These results demonstrate that the abnormal venous vasoconstriction that occurs in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension in the supine position is corrected by passive leg elevation, a manoeuvre which leads to an increase in central blood volume.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evidence for an inhibitor of leucocyte sodium transport in the serum of neonates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. In confirmation of previous studies, serum obtained from cord blood demonstrated endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactivity (EDLI). Sera from pregnant women in the third trimester also demonstrated EDLI, which disappeared after delivery. 2. Cord serum inhibited the total sodium efflux rate constant of a mixed leucocyte preparation when compared with the effect of control serum. This inhibition resulted from a depression of the ouabain-sensitive (sodium pump) component of the rate constant. 3. An ultrafiltrate of the serum (mol. wt. less than 30,000) also inhibited ouabain-sensitive leucocyte sodium transport when compared with filtrate obtained from control serum. 4. DHA-S Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHA-S) and cortisone, both present in high concentration in cord serum, demonstrated EDLI but did not affect leucocyte sodium transport in the cells of normal subjects. 5. DHA-S had no effect on sodium transport or vasoconstrictor activity in human omental resistance vessels. 6. It is concluded that EDLI of cord serum is associated with sodium transport inhibitory activity. This is unlikely to be attributable to DHA-S or cortisone.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Loop-acting diuretics do not bind to Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. Binding between the radiolabelled loop-acting diuretics ([14C]frusemide, [14C]ethacrynic acid and [3H]bumetanide) and human Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein or human serum albumin in vitro was evaluated by equilibrium dialysis. 2. The diuretic action and binding to urinary Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein of the radiolabelled diuretics in vivo, after intravenous administration, were examined in rabbits. 3. In vitro, all three radiolabelled diuretics bound strongly to human serum albumin, but not to Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. 4. Radiolabelled frusemide and bumetanide, but not ethacrynic acid, caused a diuresis in rabbits, but no binding between the drugs and Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein was seen in vivo. 5. Binding to Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein does not appear to be an important mechanism in the action of loop diuretics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide in glomerular injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside in rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 1. The nephrotic syndrome was induced in inbred female Wistar rats by the intravenous injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) (5 mg/100 g body weight). 2. One group (n = 12) received superoxide dismutase (SOD) (15 mg/kg body weight), a second group (n = 12) received polyethylene glycol coupled catalase (PEG-catalase) (5000 i.u./kg body weight) and the third (n = 9) saline (150 mmol/l NaCl) via the intraperitoneal route, in addition to the PA. 3. SOD and PEG-catalase reduced the 24 h urine protein on days 8 and 15 compared with unmodified puromycin treated animals and this difference was significant on day 15 for SOD (P less than 0.05) and for PEG-catalase (P less than 0.01). Glomerular filtration rate, as measured by the creatinine clearance, was lower in the PEG-catalase group but did not differ significantly from the saline treated group. 4. These data suggest that superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, or their reaction products, are involved in the glomerular injury of puromycin nephropathy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Allergic and irritant contact dermatitis from falcarinol and didehydrofalcarinol in common ivy (Hedera helix L.).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Experimental and chemical investigations revealed that common ivy (Hedera helix susp. helix) contains 3 compounds which are powerful irritants and moderate sensitizers. Only 2 of these constituents, falcarinol and didehydrofalcarinol, are present in the plant during the whole year. Besides Panax ginseng and Schefflera arboricola, this is the third species of the Araliaceae in which these polyacetylenic sensitizers have been found. Falcarinol and didehydrofalcarinol also occur in Hedera helix subsp. canariensis. 4 patients have been patch tested. Even in low concentrations (0.03%), the main allergen falcarinol elicited strong reactions in all of them. One of the authors became sensitized during the investigations.</ABSTRACT>

- A barrier cream containing propylene glycol, silica, xylene, dioctyl adipate and amyl acetate was applied topically for 3 months in 3 species of animal. Patch tests were carried out in human volunteers up to 72 h. The cream produced slight erythema in rats, guinea pigs and rabbits, but the irritation indices remained within safe limits. Histologically, mild focal thickening and moderate thickening of stratum corneum were observed in rats and guinea pigs, respectively, after 3 months of daily application. Patch testing in human volunteers indicated that the barrier cream is reasonably safe for human use.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Knuckle pads in live-chicken hangers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A study of live-chicken hangers in a poultry processing plant demonstrated a high prevalence of callosities over the knuckles (knuckle pads) of both hands. Knuckle pads were observed in 56% (23/41) of live-chicken hangers, but in no (0/41) workers from other departments (p less than 0.001). The probable cause was the repeated striking and sliding of the knuckles against metal shackles in which live birds were being placed. Additional medical and ergonomic evaluation would be worthwhile to confirm the probable cause, to determine whether associated tissue disorders are present in the digits of chicken hangers who develop knuckle pads, and to suggest preventive measures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Contact allergy to cosmetics: causative ingredients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Of 1781 patients with contact dermatitis seen during a period of 6 years (1981-1986), 75 (4.2%) had allergy to cosmetic products. The face was most frequently affected. In many cases, the dermatitis was limited to the eyelids (18.7%) or the face (40.0%). Skin care products (moisturizing and cleansing cream/lotion/milk) accounted for more than half (52.3%), followed by nail cosmetics (8.0%), shaving preparations (8.0%) and deodorants (6.8%). The ingredients most often responsible were fragrances (45.1%), followed by the preservative Kathon CG (11.0%) and the emulsifier oleamidopropyl dimethylamine (9.8%). In 14 patients (18.7%), patch tests with the responsible cosmetic product were negative. In them, the diagnosis was made by use tests and/or repeated open application tests. Compulsory declaration of ingredients on cosmetic product labels in the EEC, analagous to the USA situation, would be of great benefit both to patients and to physicians.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diagnostic procedures for eczema patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Of 7887 patients with eczema seen in a private dermatological practice over a period of 2 years and 4 months, a specific final diagnosis was found in 5376 (68%), while a final diagnosis of non-specific eczema was made in 2511 cases (32%). The most common final diagnoses were seborrhoeic dermatitis (1351), contact dermatitis (1317), atopic dermatitis (1009) and nummular eczema (822). Battery patch testing was the initial diagnostic procedure performed, and 897 of the 3164 patients who were patch tested had one or more positive patch tests. In 545 cases, the reactions were considered of relevance to the current dermatitis. Tests for immediate-type allergy were carried out in 618 patients, and 284 of these had one or more positive tests. In 86 patients, these test results were of diagnostic significance. 257 patients with positive patch tests were challenged orally with the relevant substance, and 53 of 156 reacted to metal salts, most commonly nickel, while 25 of 101 reacted to orally ingested balsam of Peru. Among patch-test-negative patients, 66 of 408 had positive reactions to one or more metal salts; 41 of 180 reacted to balsam of Peru, while 15 of 41 reacted to various food additives.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Oral challenge with food additives.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A randomized, placebo-controlled oral challenge with food additives (preservatives and food colorings) was carried out in 101 patients with eczema of undetermined origin who suspected that the intake of certain foods aggravated their dermatitis. 37 reacted to 1 or more of the food additives but not to a placebo, while 16 reacted to the placebo, or both the placebo and food additives. 48 had no reactions. The difference between the number of reactions to the food additives and the number of reactions to the placebo was not statistically significant. The reactions could be reproduced in only 1/3 of those challenged twice. It was not possible to correlate the reactions to food additives to reactivity to specific foodstuffs containing the same additives. If intolerance to food additives is suspected, an elimination diet seems warranted, regardless of whether the patient reacts to oral challenge with food additives.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- 5 commercial products were tested pairwise as prophylaxis against itching and irritation from glass fibres: a commercial cream for glass fibre itching, a silicone spray, an emollient cream, a fatty ointment, and a "cream-ointment". The preparations were found to have very limited value in protection against glass fibre irritation. Some workers even experienced exacerbated itching from all the preparations, including the cream marketed for protection against glass fibre irritation. Only 25% of a group of workers with severe glass fibre itching still used an emollient cream after 12 weeks.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Of 545 consecutive contact dermatitis clinic patients, 271 (49.7%) were women, 29 (10.7%) of whom had hand dermatitis alone. 17 (58.6%) of these hand cases were allergic, the main sensitizers being nickel and essential oils in oranges. Dress makers were mostly affected by nickel, while orange sellers and peelers were positive to orange peel, fragrance mix, balsam of Peru and formaldehyde in varying combinations. 8 (27.6%) of the hand cases were due to irritants and wet jobs, and possibly to allergens not tested. 24 (83%) of the hand cases were occupational. Only 1 Nigerian woman had true housewife's hand dermatitis. It was not possible to define the role of atopy because of unreliable histories. 2 cases of pompholyx and a negative patch test occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Synchronous versus nonsynchronous high-frequency jet ventilation: effects on cardiorespiratory variables and airway pressures in postoperative patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In order to compare the differences of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) synchronized with the cardiac cycle (sync) to that nonsynchronized with the cardiac cycle (async), ten stable postoperative ICU patients, without heart failure, in sinus rhythm were ventilated randomly in either mode. The async mode was HFJV at 100 cycle/min, while the sync mode was HFJV triggered by the R-wave of the ECG tracing. The heart rate ranged between 64 and 127 beat/min. Synchronization was studied at one of two periods, sync 0 and sync 60. Sync 0 consisted of inspiration triggered by the R-wave, with jet ventilation occurring early in systole; sync 60 represented a 60% delay of the time between the succeeding R-waves, with jet ventilation occurring in mid-diastole. There was no significant difference in the cardiorespiratory data when async was compared to either sync 0 or sync 60. Therefore, in these patients without heart failure, the selection of async vs. either sync mode appeared to have neither adverse nor beneficial hemodynamic effects.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Endotracheal administration of surfactant in very low birth weight infants with respiratory distress syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study was designed to evaluate whether the ventilatory maneuvers associated with surfactant replacement would, per se, influence oxygenation in newborn infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome. Eight patients (700 to 1400 g), all requiring mechanical ventilation with fraction of inspired oxygen greater than 0.6, were included in the trial; four were randomized to receive surfactant, and the others served as controls. Porcine surfactant (2 ml/kg; phospholipid concentration, 100 mg/ml) was instilled via a naso-endotracheal tube at end-expiration and dispersed into the lungs during a period of standardized "sighing" mediated by the ventilator: two prolonged ventilatory cycles (10 sec each) with an inspiration/expiration ratio of 4:1, followed by a 6-min ventilation with a frequency of 60 breath/min and an inspiration/expiration ratio of 4:1. Control babies received no surfactant but were otherwise subjected to the same ventilatory maneuvers. Surfactant-treated infants showed a rapid increase in transcutaneous oxygen associated with improved lung aeration in chest x-rays; the response was transient in three babies and persistent in one. No improvement was observed in control babies. We conclude that the beneficial effect of surfactant replacement cannot be attributed to the ventilatory maneuvers associated with the instillation procedure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Serial cardiovascular variables in survivors and nonsurvivors of human septic shock: heart rate as an early predictor of prognosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Forty-eight septic shock patients with positive blood cultures had conventional serial hemodynamic evaluations until recovery or death to identify early cardiovascular variables that predicted outcome. There were 19 (40%) survivors and 29 nonsurvivors. At the initial evaluation, both survivors and nonsurvivors demonstrated an elevated cardiac index (CI), low systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and normal stroke volume index. However, only an initial heart rate (HR) less than 106 beat/min significantly predicted survival. Twenty-four hours after the onset of shock, both an HR less than 95 beat/min and an SVRI greater than 1529 dyne.sec/cm5.m2 predicted survival. Comparing the hemodynamic profiles from the initial to the 24 h time point, a decrease in HR greater than 18 beat/min or a decrease in CI greater than 0.5 L/min.m2 predicted survival. Twenty-two deaths occurred in the first week of study, of which 18 (82%) were due primarily to low SVRI and four (18%) to low CI. Seven deaths occurred after 1 wk, all of which were due to multiple organ failure.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We conducted a prospective multi-institutional study of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonias in 1378 patients admitted to the ICUs of six hospitals. We also investigated 1005 of these patients who were intubated and mechanically ventilated for a reason other than pneumonia, the risk of developing pneumonia, and the relationship between the incidence of pneumonia and the length of time during which the patients were mechanically ventilated. A bacteriologic diagnosis was made in 38% of the nosocomial and 21% of the community-acquired pneumonias. The total mortality rate was 40%; 47% of the patients with nosocomial and 17% of the patients with community-acquired pneumonias died. Because it was difficult to make an etiologic diagnosis in two-thirds of the cases, the treatment had to be based on an assumed causative organism.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Detrimental effect of reverse triiodothyronine in hemorrhagic shock.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To examine whether reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), generally considered devoid of biological activity, could influence outcome in circulatory collapse, 23 anesthetized mongrel dogs were subjected to hemorrhagic shock. In 10 dogs, 15 micrograms/kg of rT3 were administered iv 30 min before hemorrhage. In 13 other dogs, an equal volume of saline was injected. The dogs were bled rapidly to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg, and after 60 min the reservoir line was clamped for 30 min. The shed blood was then reinfused over 30 min. After one hour of hemodynamic monitoring, the dogs were returned to the kennel and observed for at least 3 days. During shock there were few significant intergroup hemodynamic-metabolic differences. In the control group, six of 13 dogs died, whereas nine of ten dogs given rT3 died (p less than .03). This study strongly suggests that rT3 exerts detrimental biological activity in canine hemorrhagic shock. Hence, rT3 may play a causative role in the euthyroid sick ("low T3") syndrome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Slow versus rapid closed-chest cardiac compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in puppies.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The recommended rates for closed-chest cardiac compressions during CPR are based on physiologic variations with increasing age rather than experimental data. Using puppies, we compared mean arterial pressure, cardiac index (CI), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) at a slow (40/min, group 1) and a rapid (120/min, group 2) rate. CBF was measured in all experiments by N2O uptake before and during CPR from cardiac arrest induced with KCl. Both CI and CBF were measured in half of the subjects with radiolabeled microspheres. Groups 1 and 2 were similar in terms of baseline mean weight, mean arterial pressure, CI, CBF, and arterial and venous blood gases. During resuscitation for group 1, the mean CI was 221 ml/min . m2, and the mean CBF was 4 ml/100 g . min determined by N2O uptake (2 ml/100 g.min by microspheres); in group 2, the respective means were 248 ml/min . m2 and 4 ml/100 g . min with both techniques. The values for mean CI and CBF (N2O or microspheres) did not differ significantly at either rate of compression. The N2O uptake and microsphere techniques for measuring CBF correlated closely during spontaneous cardiac contractions and mechanical chest compressions. We conclude that a) closed-chest cardiac compressions at either rate studied provided inadequate CBF, and b) the N2O uptake and microsphere techniques give similar measures of CBF under conditions of normal and low flow.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The UCLA population studies of chronic obstructive respiratory disease. 9. Lung function changes associated with chronic exposure to photochemical oxidants; a cohort study among never-smokers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two cohorts of never-smoking residents of Los Angeles were studied on two occasions five years apart. One cohort (N = 1,099) lived in a community with moderate levels of photochemical pollution and low levels of other pollutants, and the second (N = 1,117) lived in a community with very high levels of photochemical oxidant and relatively high levels of sulfates and particulates. Studies included measurement of forced expiratory volumes and flow rates and single-breath nitrogen washout, as well as use of a standardized questionnaire. The data represent 47 percent of 2,340 and 58 percent of 1,935 residents, respectively, of the original community samples. Mean baseline spirometry and nitrogen washout for those who were and those who were not retested were similar, reflecting the fact that loss to follow-up was primarily due to changes of residence. In the more polluted area there were significantly worse lung function test results for both men and women at baseline and significantly more rapid deterioration at follow-up. Mean changes in nitrogen washout were significantly greater in the more polluted community for both sexes and for all age groups including children. Most of the spirometric test results showed significantly more rapid decline among adults in the more polluted community. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic exposures to a mix of photochemical oxidants, sulfates and particulates are associated with increased loss of lung function, which is especially marked among tests that reflect function of the small airways.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We studied 152 COPD patients with a daytime PaO2 greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg using formal polysomnography (EEG, airflow, respiratory muscle movement, ear oximeter) to detect the presence of nocturnal, nonapneic, oxyhemoglobin desaturation. Nine subjects were disqualified by the unexpected discovery of sleep apnea, as were another eight because they could not sleep in the laboratory setting. Of the remaining 135 subjects, 37 (27 percent) desaturated below a baseline sleep saturation of 90 percent for five minutes or more, reaching a nadir saturation of at least 85 percent. Anthropomorphic, pulmonary function, and historic factors comparing desaturators and nondesaturators failed to separate the groups. Awake PaO2 at rest in the desaturators was significantly lower than in the nondesaturators. The PaCO2 was higher in the desaturators. Reversibility of the desaturation phenomenon was demonstrated in three patients during subsequent polysomnographic studies following periods of clinical improvement. Continuous oxyhemoglobin monitoring during sleep remains the only reliable tool for detecting nocturnal desaturation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Coronary arteriographic lesion of unstable angina.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The morphology of the coronary arteriographic lesions in 109 patients with coronary disease was correlated with their clinical history. Unstable angina, characterized by new onset of angina, angina at rest, or an increase in frequency or ease of precipitation of attacks within the previous two months, was present in 73 patients (group A). The other 36 patients had no history of instability within two months (group B). "Type T" lesions, defined as eccentric narrowing with jagged irregular borders with overlapping or undermined areas, or intraluminal filling defects circumferentially outlined by contrast material were found in 73 percent of group 1 vs 47 percent of group B (p less than 0.01). The presence of these angiographic lesions suggests that a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque and/or thrombus commonly plays a role in the etiology of unstable angina.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Occupational asthma in a national disability survey.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The contribution of workplace exposures to the prevalence of asthma in adults has been minimized in the epidemiology of this illness. Analysis of the 1978 Social Security Disability Survey provides a population-based assessment as a novel approach utilizing self-attributed, occupationally related asthma as a measure of disease. Of 6,063 respondents, 468 (7.7 percent) identified asthma as a personal medical condition; 72 (1.2 percent [15.4 percent of all those with asthma]) attributed it to workplace exposures. These subjects were older and included more men and cigarette smokers than groups of both asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects. The relative risk for occupationally attributed asthma was elevated among industrial and agricultural workers as compared with white collar and service occupations. Analysis of disability benefit status did not indicate that this introduced major reporting bias in this survey. This study suggests that occupational factors may have a greater role in adult asthma than previously thought.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in breathing and the pharynx after weight loss in obstructive sleep apnea.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of weight loss following dietary restriction on disordered breathing on the pharyngeal airway is controversial in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We therefore prospectively studied eight patients before and after dietary-induced weight loss. Mean weight loss was 20.6 kg +/- 12.8 SD. After weight loss there were significant improvements in PO2 and PCO2 measured during wakefulness, and in the number of desaturation episodes per hour of sleep, average desaturation per episode, and number of movement arousals. The number of apneas and hypopneas significantly decreased in six of eight patients. There was a significant correlation between body mass index and number of disordered breathing events. Nasopharyngeal collapsibility and pulse flow resistance decreased in awake patients after weight loss. We conclude that moderate weight loss in obese patients with OSA improves oxygenation during both sleep and wakefulness, decreases the number of disordered breathing events in many patients, decreases the collapsibility of the nasopharyngeal airway.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Respiratory effects of cocaine "freebasing" among habitual users of marijuana with or without tobacco.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Use of cocaine by smoking its alkaline precursor ("freebasing") has become increasingly prevalent. Recent studies of small numbers of cocaine users suggest that freebasing frequently causes cough, dyspnea, and abnormalities in diffusing capacity (DCO), although these findings could have been due to concomitant use of other drugs. We therefore evaluated the relationship between cocaine use by freebasing and chronic respiratory symptoms and lung dysfunction in a large sample of habitual smokers of marijuana with or without tobacco who denied intravenous drug abuse. The findings suggested that, among habitual marijuana smokers, "moderate" cocaine smoking damaged both large and small airways, as reflected by functional changes that were independent of concomitant marijuana use and appeared to be synergistic with the effects of tobacco. On the other hand, no adverse influence of cocaine smoking on the pulmonary microcirculation was demonstrated in our sample of freebase users.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Magnetic resonance imaging of blood flow in thoracic vessels of patients with impaired left ventricular function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In order to test the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) in the detection of pathologic flow conditions in man, we imaged 10 normal volunteers and 10 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) with ECG-gated MR. We used a single spin-echo sequence on a transverse plane through the main vessels of the upper chest. The analysis of the variation of the mean signal intensity vs time from the ascending aorta (AA), descending aorta (DA), and pulmonary artery (PA) of the ten normal volunteers on the TE = 30 ms images, showed a common pattern characterized by an end-diastolic intraluminal signal not present in other moments of the cardiac cycle. On the contrary, in patients with CHF, we did not observe the systolic disappearance of the intraluminal MR signal. The main difference between CHF patients and control subjects was found in the DA where an abnormally high signal intensity was present for the whole cardiac cycle. The MR imaging can offer blood flow information underlying the behavior of intraluminal signal intensity and could provide functional information in patients with heart failure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Serial evaluation of cardiac function with aortic regurgitation caused by serious aortic lesions. A preliminary comparative study with isolated chronic aortic incompetence.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clinical and hemodynamic appearances of aortic regurgitation caused by serious aortic lesions (AR-Ao-group) seemed more deteriorated than those with isolated chronic aortic regurgitation (AR-group). Often postoperative course and operative outcome are smooth and satisfactory in the AR-Ao-group. To support this observation, serial changes of left ventricular (LV) function and LV sphericity were evaluated before and after operation in ten cases in the AR-Ao-group and compared with those in the AR-group. Before operation, there were no significant differences in LV function between the two groups. Postoperative improvement of LV sphericity and LV function were statistically better in the AR-Ao-group. The LV function reserve was considered sufficiently retained in the AR-Ao-group. Results with this study supported that clinical observation. Therefore, the total correction, at the same time of aortic incompetence and aortic lesions is recommended.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Transthoracic needle biopsy of lung in nonhospitalized patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To confirm the safety of transthoracic needle biopsy of the lung (TNB) in the outpatient setting, we reviewed our experience with 106 such procedures over three years. We compared the operating characteristics and morbidity with the 65 similar procedures we were asked to perform on hospitalized patients during the same period. Outpatients did not differ from inpatients in mean age, sex, incidence of clinically apparent COPD, size and location of lesion, or number of needle passes. The operating characteristics of the biopsy were the same for the two groups. Pneumothorax occurred in 29 (27 percent) of 106 outpatient and 26 (40 percent) of 65 inpatient TNBs. Few pneumothoraces not present upon completion of biopsy developed during four hours of observation or later. The requirement for chest tube drainage was similar for both groups, 5.7 and 4.6 percent, respectively. With appropriate caution, TNB can be performed safely on an outpatient basis and the cost of an uncomplicated procedure reduced by 27 percent.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lack of effect of hydration on sputum production in chronic bronchitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Patients with chronic lung disease productive of sputum are generally encouraged to drink a large amount of fluid to facilitate sputum production. This clinical practice has not been tested systematically. Twelve outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in clinically stable condition who had daily sputum production were asked in random sequence: 1) to drink one glass of fluid every waking hour after supper and upon waking the next morning (hydration), 2) to drink no fluid after supper and upon waking the next morning (dry), and 3) to drink fluid ad lib (ad lib). Each morning sputum collection was started upon waking and continued for four hours. The differences in volume, elasticity of sputum, respiratory symptoms, and ease of expectoration were not significant. We conclude that moderate hydration and dehydration have no effect on volume expectorated, the elasticity of sputum, respiratory symptoms or forced expiratory volume in one second.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prostaglandin E1 as a screening vasodilator in primary pulmonary hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pulmonary vasodilators are variably efficacious in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). None has consistently improved hemodynamics enough to obviate the need for complex and potentially hazardous testing of several vasodilators. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a potent, short-acting pulmonary vasodilator, was administered to seven patients with PPH in order to determine whether PGE1 could accurately predict the hemodynamic and gas exchange effects of other commonly used vasodilators. Prostaglandin E1, nifedipine and hydralazine were administered to the patients while measuring pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics and arterial blood gases. Prostaglandin E1 was easily titrated but was inconsistent as a predictor of the effects of the other vasodilators with respect to pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output and adverse effects on arterial oxygenation. This study suggests that patients with PPH must still receive carefully monitored trials of several vasodilators to determine whether there is a beneficial response and to select the appropriate treatment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Microprocessor exercise physiology systems vs a nonautomated system. A comparison of data output.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Several microprocessor exercise physiology systems have been introduced recently. Comparison of the data output between these systems and more traditional nonautomated systems has not been reported extensively. Twelve normal adult men were exercised in random sequence on different days on a Sensormedics MMC Horizon system, the Medical Graphics Corporation System 2000, and a nonautomated system. heart rate, minute ventilation, tidal volume, respiratory frequency, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production were compared at each level of work during a maximal incremental test and during a constant work load test. The overall data output between the three systems was comparable. However, minute ventilation was consistently higher on the Medical Graphics system, oxygen consumption was consistently lower on the Horizon system, and a technical error was discovered in the Medical Graphics system which resulted in a systematic overestimation of carbon dioxide production. Different methods of analyzing the data from the same test (60-s average, 15-s average, breath-by-breath, and 8-breath average) resulted in differences of up to 20 percent in the maximal values. This was greater than the differences between the three systems. Despite the comparability of the data output, important differences did exist which can be potentially significant when data output from one system are compared to predicted normal values obtained under different conditions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tremolite whitewashing and pleural calcifications.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Radiologic screening of 688 inhabitants of the Metsovo area in Northwest Greece revealed that 323 (46.9 percent) had pleural calcifications. The percentage of positive examinations rose with age. Calcifications were observed in all four villages of the area where a material ("luto" soil) had been extensively used for whitewashing until 1940 to 1950. In four other villages in the immediate vicinity, where "luto" had never been used, pleural calcifications were not observed. Results suggest that Metsovo tremolite may have caused pleural calcifications to all individuals born in Metsovo before 1940. This is the first study indicating that environmental asbestos exposure can cause abnormalities in everyone exposed to it.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pulse oximetry for tapering supplemental oxygen in hospitalized patients. Evaluation of a protocol.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In a randomized study, we determined the clinical and financial effects of replacing arterial blood gas measurements with finger pulse oximeter readings during the process of tapering supplemental oxygen in hospitalized patients. The 16 patients in the control group, whose management followed conventional practice in our hospital, received a total of 57 arterial blood gas measurements during the 6.6 (mean) days it took for them to taper to their discharge supplemental oxygen level (usually room air). The 13 patients randomized to the oximeter study group had their arterial oxygen saturation monitored by pulse oximetry. The physicians of patients in the oximeter group were at liberty to obtain arterial blood gas determinations during the study if they desired. The oximeter study group had fewer (p less than 0.005) arterial punctures for blood gas measurements (total of 16 for the group) and fewer (p less than 0.001) days on supplemental oxygen (mean of 2.7 days per patient). We conclude that substituting noninvasive pulse oximetry for arterial blood gas measurements during reductions of supplemental oxygen shortened the days of oxygen use and decreased the number of arterial blood gas determinations in our patients. In addition to reducing the discomfort to patients, the use of oximetry was of financial benefit in that it reduced medical personnel time, blood gas analyzer use, and duration of oxygen administration.</ABSTRACT>

- Pneumatocele formation is unusual in adult pneumonia, particularly in pneumococcal pneumonia. We report three cases of pneumatocele formation in adults, including one with probable pneumococcal pneumonia. All three patients were severely ill and two expired. Although they are usually asymptomatic, pneumatoceles may enlarge and compress the adjacent lung and mediastinum. This occurred in two patients causing respiratory insufficiency and cardiovascular compromise. The placement of a chest tube into the enlarging pneumatocele resulted in successful decompression.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A community-wide assessment of the use of pulmonary artery catheters in patients with acute myocardial infarction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- As part of an on-going population-based study of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (MI) in all 16 hospitals in the Worcester, Massachusetts Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, temporal trends in the use of the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter were examined. Three thousand two hundred and sixty-three patients with validated acute MI during the calendar years 1975, 1978, 1981 and 1984 comprised the study population. There has been a consistent and significant increase in PA catheter use in patients with acute MI over time, from 7.2 percent in 1975, 13.8 percent in 1978, 14.8 percent in 1981 to 19.9 percent in 1984 (p less than .001). Ninety-six percent of patients undergoing PA catheter investigation had either congestive heart failure (CHF), hypotension or cardiogenic shock. For the combined time periods, the in-hospital case fatality rate (CFR) for patients in CHF with a PA catheter was 44.8 percent compared to 25.3 percent for patients without a PA catheter (p less than .001). For patients with hypotension and a PA catheter, in-hospital CFR was 48.3 percent compared to 32.2 percent for hypotensive patients not receiving a PA catheter (p less than .001). In contrast, for patients in cardiogenic shock the in-hospital CFR was 74.4 percent for those receiving a PA catheter as compared to 79.1 percent for patients in shock not receiving a catheter. The use of a PA catheter was associated with an increased length of hospital stay irrespective of the development of acute clinical complications. Long-term prognosis for discharged hospital survivors who had a complicated MI, for up to a five-year follow-up period was similar whether the patient did or did not receive a PA catheter during the acute period of hospitalization. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate a beneficial effect associated with the use of the PA catheter on selected patient outcomes, including in-hospital and long-term prognosis and average hospital stay, in this community-wide study of patients hospitalized with acute MI.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Drug-induced left ventricular failure in patients with pulmonary disease. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstration of catecholamine myocarditis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three patients with severe chronic lung disease had left ventricular failure develop with marked impairment of cardiac function. Ejection fractions by radioactive blood pool ventriculography were 0.17, 0.24, and 0.20. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed interstitial hemorrhage and foci of interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocytes, strongly suggestive of catecholamine myocarditis. These patients had used beta-adrenergic agonist inhalants and methylxanthines. One of them clearly abused the inhalant and had elevated levels of urinary catecholamines. Progressive deterioration of pulmonary and cardiac function occurred in two patients, with death within three months of the initial myocardial biopsy. Concomitant use of beta-adrenergic agonists and methylxanthines may cause myocarditis with left ventricular failure in susceptible patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Atypical diabetes insipidus in small cell lung cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome or metastatic disease?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 54-year old man was admitted with extensive disease: small cell lung cancer, and severe central diabetes insipidus. Computer assisted tomography of the brain was negative for metastatic spread to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Basic levels of antidiuretic hormone were within normal limits, yet the hormone failed to increase secondary to elevated osmotic load. We hypothesize that in this patient, hypothalamus and pituitary gland were morphologically intact, and that diabetes insipidus was induced by the inhibitory action of ectopic opiates on the release of antidiuretic hormone. Nevertheless, since post-mortem studies were refused, metastatic diabetes insipidus could not be definitely excluded, in which case, the source of plasmatic antidiuretic hormone would be the tumor itself.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Fifty-six papers published between 1979 and 1986 that tested regimens of antibacterial bowel preparation before elective colorectal operations were studied using a numerical score devised for assessing publications of random control clinical trials. A maximum score of 100 was allotted: 50 for 15 aspects of design, 30 for ten aspects of analysis, and 20 for eight aspects of presentation. The 56 papers scored from 33 to 89, (mean, 61.6, standard deviation, 11.9). Only 13 (23 percent) reached a score of more than 70. The most frequent errors in design were the use of placebos in the control group (27 percent) and faulty methods of randomization (36 percent). Errors in analysis resulted in penalization of more papers than any other aspect; these included the almost universal omission of confidence limits, confusion of exclusions and withdrawals (46 percent), not recording the fate of withdrawals (80 percent) and incorrect use of statistical tests (55 percent). Ten papers reported results showing important clinical differences that did not achieve statistical significance, but only two mentioned the Type II error. Defects in presentation were less frequently encountered; the most common were inaccessibility of raw data (66 percent), lack of sufficient information to allow replication of methods (43 percent), and the drawing of firm conclusions from shaky data (50 percent). It was particularly disappointing that no evidence of improvement in the standard of these reports over the seven years studied was found.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Routine preoperative intravenous pyelography was performed in a series of 105 consecutive male patients with rectal or rectosigmoid carcinomas who were totally free of urinary symptoms. Abnormal findings were present in 26 percent of those patients. Postoperative intravenous pyelograms were performed in 61 patients. Twenty-one percent of patients with negative preoperative intravenous pyelograms and 42 percent of patients with positive preoperative intravenous pyelograms had abnormal findings in the postoperative intravenous pyelograms. Preoperative cystoscopy was performed in 52 patients. Thirty-one percent of patients with negative preoperative intravenous pyelograms and 76 percent of patients with positive preoperative intravenous pyelograms had abnormal cystoscopic findings. The overwhelming majority of cystoscopic findings in patients with negative preoperative intravenous pyelograms were not related to the primary tumor. The findings of this prospective study suggest that routine preoperative intravenous pyelography is indicated in patients with rectosigmoid or rectal tumors without symptoms related to the urinary tract. Postoperative intravenous pyelography is indicated only in patients with positive preoperative intravenous pyelograms. Preoperative cystoscopy is indicated when the preoperative intravenous pyelogram is positive and especially if intravenous pyelography findings are suggestive of bladder-wall defect or extrinsic pressure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Radioimmunoguided surgery using the monoclonal antibody B72.3 in colorectal tumors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors have developed a hand-held gamma-detecting probe (GDP) for intraoperative use that improves the sensitivity of external radioimmunodetection. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3 was injected in six patients with primary colorectal cancer and 31 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer an average of 16 days preoperatively. The GDP localized the MAb B72.3 in 83 percent of sites. The technique, known as a radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) system did not alter the surgical procedure in patients with primary colorectal cancer but did alter the approach in 26 percent (8/31) of patients with recurrent colorectal cancer. Two patients avoided unnecessary liver resections and two underwent extraabdominal approaches to document their disease. The RIGS system may influence the short-term morbidity and mortality of surgery for colorectal cancer. Larger series and longer follow-up are needed to determine whether the RIGS system confers a survival advantage to the patient with colorectal cancer.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Perianal Bowen's disease and associated malignancies. Results of a survey.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 1959, Graham and Helwig reported that 80 percent of patients with Bowen's disease developed associated cutaneous or internal malignancies. Subsequent to the publication of this report, extensive and invasive workup of patients with Bowen's disease became the standard of practice. The authors' personal experience with perianal Bowen's disease suggested a substantially lower correlation between that disease and associated malignancies. Therefore a survey was initiated by contacting active members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons to investigate further. Analysis of 106 cases demonstrated a lower incidence of associated malignancies (4.7 percent) subsequent to diagnosis of perianal Bowen's disease. The data further indicated, however, that these patients are at risk to develop recurrent Bowen's disease (9.4 percent) and invasive carcinoma (5.7 percent). It is concluded that an extensive and invasive workup of patients with perianal Bowen's disease is not indicated and that the patient's greatest risk is development of recurrent or invasive disease.</ABSTRACT>

- While it is well known that large doses of somatostatin inhibit human pancreatic enzyme secretion, it is still unknown whether low doses are also effective and whether the peptide is able to inhibit bicarbonate production. Eight subjects with external transduodenal drainage of the main pancreatic duct performed after biliary tract surgery were studied. Somatostatin was infused at progressively increasing rates of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, and 1.35 micrograms/kg/hr, for 30 min/dose, during pancreatic stimulation with secretin, 25 ng/kg/hr, and cerulein, 10 ng/kg/hr. Somatostatin, at the dose of 0.05 microgram/kg/hr (shown to produce blood levels similar to those measured after a meal) did not affect pancreatic secretion in any of the subjects. The successive three higher doses caused a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of protein concentration and output and of bicarbonate output. Bicarbonate concentration was slightly but significantly reduced only by the two highest doses of somatostatin. At each dose level, the inhibition of protein output was much more marked than the inhibition of bicarbonate output. The maximal inhibition of protein output (at 1.35 micrograms/kg/hr somatostatin) was 73.9 +/- 5.4%, and that of bicarbonate output was 55.9 +/- 6.4%. The results demonstrate that: (1) the administration of somatostatin at a low dose level does not affect human exocrine pancreatic secretion, at least under the experimental conditions of this study; and (2) the administration of larger doses of somatostatin inhibits pancreatic secretion of both protein and bicarbonate dose-dependently. The inhibitory effect on protein output is significantly greater than that on water and bicarbonate production.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Carbohydrate malabsorption is minimal in school-age cystic fibrosis children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifteen school-age cystic fibrosis children, participating in a year-long nutritional management study, were hospitalized at six-month intervals for balance studies during which they continued "free-choice" diets and their usual enzyme supplementation. Stools were analyzed for fat and protein by conventional methods and for carbohydrate using a recently validated anthrone method. Despite persistent fat and protein malabsorption, less than 1% of ingested carbohydrate was lost intact in the stools. Comparison of baseline and placebo balance studies showed fecal excretion of carbohydrate to be independent of intake, in contrast to the fat and protein results. Using a thin-layer chromatography method capable of detecting microgram quantities of urinary organic acids, no short-chain fatty acids were detected in the stool. Further exploration of carbohydrate as a dietary energy source for this patient group with increased energy demands should be pursued.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Super-efficient starch absorption. A risk factor for colonic neoplasia?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We tested the hypothesis that super-efficient starch absorption, by reducing the supply of carbohydrate to the colon, may be associated with and possibly promote colonic neoplasia. By means of breath hydrogen measurements following a potato meal and comparison with the hydrogen response to lactulose, the amount of starch escaping small bowel absorption was measured in 10 patients who had a colonic adenoma removed endoscopically and in 10 controls. The subjects' consumption of starch and fiber was assessed. Percentage unabsorbed starch was approximately half as much in the patients (5.3%) compared with the controls (10.9%, P less than 0.05). Consumption of starch and dietary fiber, and mouth-to-cecum transit times were not significantly different. Unabsorbed starch was calculated to contribute to 6.0 g/day colonic carbohydrate in the patients and 10.9 g/day in the controls (P less than 0.05). This study confirms that unabsorbed starch provides an important quantity of colonic carbohydrate and suggests that super-efficient starch absorption, by reducing this provision, may promote colonic neoplasia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Passage of salivary amylase through the stomach in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- With an inhibitor assay technique rates of passage of salivary and pancreatic isoamylase through the jejunum were measured in six healthy volunteers after different liquid, intragastric meals. In all subjects and in 13/17 experiments, more than 2500 units of salivary amylase were passed over 200 postcibal minutes. Salivary amylase comprised 13.8 +/- 3.9% (mean +/- SEM) of the total amylase and appeared predominantly as single, distinct peak. The inhibitor method was validated by isoelectric focusing (r = 0.988; P less than 0.001; N = 7). The frequency of detection of salivary amylase in gastric or jejunal samples fell as gastric pH fell below 3.0. In vitro, amylase was inactivated in gastric juice as pH fell between 3.8 and 3.3. Salivary amylase accounted for 11% of total amylase output in a normal and 27% in an achlorhydric subject after a hamburger meal. We conclude that amylase should not be measured in postprandial studies of pancreatic secretion in humans without correction for salivary amylase.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in colorectal function in patients with chronic colonic pseudoobstruction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Motility studies of the lower bowel, radiology to exclude other gastrointestinal involvement, and rectal biopsies were carried out in 11 patients, age 21-60 years, with isolated chronic colonic pseudoobstruction. Repeated plain abdominal x-rays during symptomatic periods revealed massive gaseous colonic distension in all. Seven patients had the primary form while four patients had an underlying disease which could have been responsible for the chronic colonic pseudoobstruction. Lower bowel motility was decreased in patients with the primary form. Rectal wall elasticity was increased in both the primary and secondary form. Some of the abnormalities measured may suggest myogenic abnormalities of the sigmoid or rectal wall. No specific neural or muscular morphologic defect was identified in colonic transmural sections in eight patients except in the patient with Hirschsprung's disease. Five of seven patients with primary colonic pseudoobstruction achieved symptomatic relief only after subtotal colectomy and ileoproctostomy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide, somatostatin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin octapeptide, and secretin on intestinal absorption of amino acid in rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SRIF), neurotensin (NT), cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), and secretin (SEC) on the intestinal absorption of amino acid were investigated. Six groups of Wistar rats were studied: (1) controls; (2) VIP treated; (3) SRIF treated; (4) NT treated; (5) CCK-8 treated; (6) SEC treated. [3H]Leucine was given intraluminally through a cannula at the ligament of Treitz, a number of blood samples were obtained through a superior mesenteric vein catheter 1-60 min after administration of [3H]leucine, and the radioactivity of plasma was measured to evaluate the absorption of [3H]leucine. It was shown that VIP and SRIF significantly inhibited the absorption of [3H]leucine (by 59.1% and 38.7%, respectively), whereas NT, CCK-8, and SEC significantly enhanced absorption (by 44.2%, 49.6%, and 39.1%, respectively). Radioimmunoassays of VIP, SRIF, and NT showed that at least some of the hormones or peptides exerted their effects on absorption of leucine at or near their physiological concentrations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Subtypes of muscarinic receptors in vagal inhibitory pathway to the lower esophageal sphincter of the opossum.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We assessed the characteristics of muscarinic neural transmission in the vagal inhibitory pathway to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) of anesthetized opossums. LES relaxation was induced by electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus. Measurements were made of LES relaxation before and after intravenous administration of nicotinic (hexamethonium), serotonergic (5-Meo-DMT), nonselective muscarinic (atropine), and selective muscarinic (pirenzepine-M1 and 4-DAMP-M2) antagonists. The latency of LES relaxation was increased substantially by pirenzepine and atropine, increased slightly by hexamethonium, but was not affected by 4-DAMP or 5-Meo-DMT. Given as concurrent intravenous infusions, hexamethonium, 5-Meo-DMT and 4-DAMP added to pirenzepine or atropine did not significantly increase LES relaxation latency above that caused by pirenzepine or atropine alone. None of the antagonists alone had a significant effect on percent LES relaxation. The combination of pirenzepine or 4-DAMP with hexamethonium and 5-Meo-DMT did not affect percent LES relaxation. The combination of atropine with hexamethonium and 5-Meo-DMT reduced LES relaxation to 18%. The combination of pirenzepine and 4-DAMP with hexamethonium and 5-Meo-DMT, however, had no effect on percent LES relaxation. We conclude that muscarinic participation in vagally induced LES relaxation exhibits two functional receptor subtypes: (1) M1 receptors that determine LES relaxation latency and are antagonized by pirenzepine or atropine, and (2) non-M1, non-M2 receptors (Mx receptors) that contribute to the magnitude of LES relaxation and are antagonized by atropine, but not by pirenzepine or 4-DAMP.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Milk protection against experimental ulcerogenesis in rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The antiulcer activity in pasteurized/homogenized bovine milk and a lipid extract of this milk was tested in an attempt to isolate and identify the active component. Using 0.6 N HCl as a damaging agent in pylorus-ligated rats, the protective property of milk appeared to be related to its phospholipid content and not its protein constituents. With intact (non-pylorus-ligated) rats, milk had demonstrable protective activity against 0.6 N HCl, as well as 100% ethanol and 160 mM taurocholic acid. The increasing phospholipid concentrations in skim, whole, and buttermilk paralleled their antiulcer efficacy. A lipid extract of whole milk showed significant protection against 0.6 N HCl when given alone or following indomethacin treatment. Measurements of the contact angle (hydrophobicity) of the gastric surface showed that it was maintained near control levels in the presence of 0.6 N HCl, if rats were first pretreated with milk. These results are consistent with the possibility that surface-active lipids in dairy milk, such as phospholipids, may account for a significant portion of milk's antiulcer activity by maintaining the hydrophobicity of the luminal surface of the gastric mucosa in the presence of a damaging agent.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Migrating action potential complexes in a patient with secretory diarrhea.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 70-year-old woman with secretory diarrhea was studied with a novel technique of recording small intestinal myoelectrical activity which allowed us to obtain long, uninterrupted records of slow waves and spikes at eight or more different intestinal levels simultaneously. Typical migrating action potential complexes (MAPCs) were observed, consisting of spike bursts that extended over more than one slow wave and migrated distally at the same propagation velocity as the slow waves. This motility pattern occurred frequently during the period the patient presented with secretory diarrhea and disappeared with the disappearance of the diarrhea. It was observed only once in a series of 10 normal control subjects. This is the first report on MAPC activity in man and on the association of this myoelectrical pattern with secretory diarrhea in man.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A patient with pustular psoriasis developed jaundice, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and biochemical evidence of hepatocanalicular dysfunction four weeks after the initiation of etretinate therapy. A liver biopsy specimen showed bile duct damage, a periportal imflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes, canalicular cholestasis, and focal hepatocyte necrosis. Clinical exclusion of other possible etiologic factors coupled with near resolution of the biochemical abnormalities within six weeks after complete discontinuation of the drug indicates that etretinate may induce an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction. This is the first report to document etretinate associated bile duct injury.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Studies concerning the value of therapeutic drug monitoring programs for theophylline have yielded contradictory findings. This study employed a prospective, single-blind, randomized, crossover design to evaluate the effect of a therapeutic drug monitoring program for theophylline. There were 410 serum theophylline assays performed in 169 patients. The average number of assays drawn incorrectly and the average number of assays used inappropriately were significantly reduced (from 1.87 to 1.32 and from 2.07 to 1.45, respectively) with therapeutic drug monitoring. When the program was withdrawn, no statistically significant change resulted, and when the program was reinstituted, there was improvement in audit criteria performance but the change was not statistically significant. Although the savings from the program would equal the cost in the first year, cost savings would be anticipated in the future.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Seventeen nursing home residents with sleeping problems were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of temazepam 15 mg, diphenhydramine (DPH) 50 mg, and placebo. Each drug was given for five consecutive nights with a 72-hour washout period between drugs. Subjects were assessed three times weekly with tests of psychomotor and cognitive function and four times weekly with observer sleep diaries and morning sleep questionnaires. Three subjects failed to complete the study. By report of the subjects, DPH resulted in shorter sleep latency than did placebo (t = 2.77, p less than 0.05). On the fifth night, use of DPH was associated with longer duration of sleep than temazepam (t = 2.88, p less than 0.05). No significant difference in tests of neurologic function was noted although, compared with placebo, subjects performed more poorly on seven of eight tests while taking temazepam and five of eight tests while taking DPH. Several instances of daytime hypersomnolence were noted in subjects taking temazepam and DPH, but none in subjects given placebo.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of ranitidine on chloroquine disposition.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ten healthy, male volunteers (aged 19-27 yr; weight 62-67 kg) were randomly distributed into control and test groups of five subjects each in a controlled study on the effect of ranitidine on chloroquine disposition. The control group subjects received two tablets of chloroquine sulfate (300-mg base) only. The test group subjects received ranitidine 250 mg hs for four days prior to the administration of chloroquine sulfate and throughout the sample collection period. Blood samples (5 ml) were collected from the time of the chloroquine administration to the seventh day after drug administration. The samples were analyzed for chloroquine content by a combination of thin-layer chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The Wilcoxon test at 0.05 significance level was used to compare the disposition parameters between control and test groups. Ranitidine therapy was associated with no significant alterations in chloroquine oral clearance rate, elimination rate constant, and apparent volume of distribution. Unlike cimetidine, ranitidine does not interact pharmacokinetically with chloroquine. Ranitidine, therefore, may be the H2-receptor antagonist of choice for ulcer patients receiving chloroquine.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The types and frequency of questions asked of clinical pharmacists introducing clinical pharmacy services in the internal medicine wards of a Nigerian university hospital and the degree of compliance with pharmacists' recommendations were studied. Three faculty pharmacists collected data in two 30-working day study periods, separated by a year. Totals of 197 questions (an average of 6.57 +/- 1.33 questions/working day) and 271 questions (an average of 9.03 +/- 1.10 questions/working day) were answered by the pharmacists in the first and second study periods, respectively. Pharmacists recommended changes in patient-specific drug therapy that were implemented 52 percent and 69 percent of the time in the first and second study periods, respectively. The most common type of drug information request concerned the presence or the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction. Continuous interaction between pharmacists and physicians in the patient-care setting results in a better appreciation of the pharmacist's role as drug information consultant, and the consequence of this is a high degree of compliance with pharmacists' recommendations.</ABSTRACT>

It is usually associated with psychologic distress and can be frightening to the patient. Vaginal bleeding can be the first sign of life-threatening medical disorders such as carcinoma, bleeding disorders, and trophoblastic disease. As with bleeding from other sources, it is not uncommon for a patient with significant vaginal bleeding to lose large amounts of circulating volume.

Prehospital and Emergency Department protocol should be directed at getting the mother to the labor and delivery suite as soon as possible. Most complications resulting in maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality are handled best in that setting. Prehospital and Emergency Department personnel should, however, be prepared to handle imminent delivery because it cannot be avoided when it occurs. Emergency Department personnel also should be familiar with the technique of perimortem cesarean delivery and use this technique when indicated for fetal-maternal salvage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- 19-Hydroxylation and aromatization of androgens in the developing rat brain.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Androgen aromatization in the human placenta proceeds through two successive hydroxylations at C-19, the products of which are then virtually completely converted to estrogens. In the neonatal rat brain, however, 19-hydroxylation has been shown to exceed significantly subsequent aromatization, suggesting that formation of 19-hydroxylated androgen metabolites might be important in brain differentiation in this species. Using [19-3H3]androstenedione, we found that the surplus activity of 19-hydroxylase relative to aromatase was independent of age, sex, and androgen substrate concentration, despite 100-fold differences in tissue aromatase activity during the course of development. In addition, the surplus 19-hydroxylation was not affected by several agents which otherwise decreased or increased the activity of the aromatase enzyme, including metyrapone, KCN, and cytochrome P-450 reductase, the latter indicating that the failure of the 19-hydroxylated products to proceed to aromatization was not due to a deficit of reducing equivalents. 19-Hydroxylation of androgens in the rat brain is a quantitatively significant metabolic pathway in this tissue, although present data do not confirm the existence of a steroid C-19 hydroxylase in the brain separate from that involved in aromatization.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Similarity of the clearance rates of free alpha-subunit and alpha-subunit dissociated from intact human chorionic gonadotropin, despite differences in sialic acid contents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- It is well known that the MCR of proteins can be influenced by their carbohydrate structure; i.e. the presence of terminal galactose on proteins results in uptake by hepatic receptors for galactose-terminated glycoproteins. Thus, a protein with its galactose residues covered or removed exhibits a far longer half life in plasma than one with its galactose residues exposed. The free alpha-subunit of human CG (hCG) has been shown to have a different carbohydrate composition than does the alpha-subunit dissociated from the intact hormone. In our laboratory, analysis of alpha-subunits isolated from pregnancy urine indicated that the alpha-subunit dissociated from hCG (hCG alpha) contains primarily monosialylated oligosaccharides, whereas the free alpha-subunit contains more than one sialic acid per oligosaccharide. This difference in the degree of sialylation prompted us to examine the clearance rates of these two subunits. Accordingly, free alpha and hCG alpha were purified by affinity chromatography and labeled with 125I. The labeled subunits were injected iv into rats and serum samples were removed at various time intervals over a 2-h period. The amount of [125I]alpha-subunit remaining in the serum was determined by immunoprecipitation using an antiserum to hCG alpha. The disappearance curves for the two subunits were indistinguishable and could be analyzed by a biexponential model. The t 1/2 of the faster component was 5 min, while the t 1/2 of the slower component was 74 min. In order to determine whether or not terminal galactose was present on either the hCG alpha or the free alpha-subunit, the labeled molecules were subjected to lectin column chromatography using Ricin or peanut lectin linked to agarose. Both of these lectins bind galactose but have different specificities with respect to the penultimate sugar. Both subunit preparations contained only minor amounts of material which could bind or either lectin. However, after desialylation, both hCG alpha and free alpha bound extensively to Ricin, indicating the presence of penultimate galactose residues in both. We conclude that terminal galactose residues are not present on the oligosaccharides of either hCG alpha or free alpha-subunits, and that the difference observed in the sialic acid contents of the two subunits does not affect their rates of clearance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pancreatic acinar cell amylase gene expression: selective effects of adrenalectomy and corticosterone replacement.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To examine the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of the acinar pancreas, adult male rats were adrenalectomized (Adx) and replaced with no corticosterone (B), normal B, or high B. Plasma B concentration, body weight gain, and thymus weight were used as independent measures of treatment efficacy. Compared to controls, Adx animals had a 75 +/- 0.5% (n = 30) reduction in pancreatic amylase content; a 50% decrease occurred within 1 day and the maximal 75% decrease was observed after 5 days. In Adx animals, amylase content was normalized by normal B replacement and was increased to 235 +/- 39% (n = 30) of control by high B replacement. Furthermore, in all Adx rats, pancreatic content of amylase and plasma B concentration was significantly correlated (r = 0.81, n = 30). The effect of adrenalectomy was selective for amylase; contents of ribonuclease, chymotrypsin, and elastase were not altered. However, the effects of high B replacement were not selective, and increased the content of all digestive enzymes. To determine whether the changes in enzyme content were associated with changes in messenger RNA (mRNA), pancreatic RNA was probed with 32P-labeled complementary DNAs for amylase, ribonuclease, and chymotrypsin. After adrenalectomy and B replacement there was a significant correlation only between amylase mRNA (r = 0.87, n = 13) and plasma B concentration. These data indicate that physiological levels of B have a selective effect on pancreatic amylase gene expression. In contrast, high levels of B have the separate, nonselective effect of increasing the content of all digestive enzymes without increasing corresponding mRNA levels.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Age-related decrease of growth hormone and prolactin gene expression in the mouse pituitary.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of aging on pituitary GH, PRL, and alpha-tubulin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured in 3-, 12-, and 27-month-old male C57BL/6J mice by dot-blot hybridization. The amount of GH and PRL mRNA in the pituitary deceased dramatically with age. However, total poly(A+) RNA (mRNA), as measured by hybridization with radioactively labeled oligo-(dT), was not altered during aging. In addition, there were no age-related changes in the level of alpha-tubulin mRNA. Thus, the effects of aging on GH and PRL mRNA levels are specific; the levels of the majority of cellular mRNAs are not altered with age. GH and mRNA levels decreased 35% between 3 and 12 months (P less than 0.05) and a total of 75% after 27 months (P less than 0.01). PRL mRNA levels decreased 65% between 12 and 27 months (P less than 0.01), although there was no significant decrease before 12 months. Whereas T3 is the most potent regulator of GH gene expression, we did not detect any significant age-related change in serum T3 levels. These results suggest that factors other than T3 play a role in the age-related decline in GH and PRL gene expression.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Transuterofetoplacental conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone in antiestrogen-treated baboons.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The present study was designed to characterize the dynamics of progestin metabolism peripherally and across the uterus during normal baboon pregnancy and to determine whether the decline in placental progesterone (P4) production which results from administration of the antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) to baboons reflects a decrease in conversion of pregnenolone (P5) to P4 and thus delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. To examine this possibility, the conversion of [3H]P5 to [3H]P4 was determined by the constant infusion method on day 100 (midgestation) and day 175 (near term) of gestation in baboons that received MER-25 (25 mg/day X kg BW, po) on days 95-100 or 140-175 (term = 184 days). Baboons were sedated with ketamine HCl, then received a constant iv infusion of [3H]P5 (1.0 mu Ci/0.388 ml X min) and [14C]P4 (0.2 mu Ci/0.388 ml X min for 110 min. Radiolabeled progestins were purified from blood samples withdrawn from saphenous, uterine, and umbilical vessels, and the MCR of P4 and P5, uterine extraction of P5, and transfer constants (rho) for the peripheral, transuterofetoplacental, and transuteroplacental conversion of P5 to P4 were determined. The formation of P4 from P5 by incubates of placental cells obtained on day 175 from untreated and MER-25-treated baboons was also assessed. During normal baboon pregnancy the mean (+/- SE) % P5 extracted (i.e. metabolized) by the uterus was 31.0 +/- 3.3 at midgestation and 45.7 +/- 5.6 late in gestation. Peripheral and transuterofetoplacental rho values of P5 to P4 in untreated baboons were 6.9 +/- 1.8% and 37.3 +/- 7.9%, respectively, at midgestation and 6.1 +/- 0.6% and 46.8 +/- 10.1%, respectively, near term. The transuteroplacental rho of P5 to P4 was only slightly lower than the transuterofetoplacental values, indicating minimal conversion of P5 to P4 by the fetus. The peripheral contribution of P5 production to the total production rate of P4 at term in baboons was 1%. The contribution of uteroplacental conversion of P5 to P4 to the total conversion of P5 to P4 at midgestation was estimated to be 22%. MER-25 caused a 53% decline (P less than 0.01) in serum P4 concentrations from a mean (+/- SE) of 12.5 +/- 2.4 ng/ml during the pretreatment period to 5.4 +/- 0.3 ng/ml between days 140 and 175 of gestation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A sensitive thyrotropin (TSH) bioassay based on iodide uptake in rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells: comparison with the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response to human serum TSH and enzymatically deglycosylated bovine and human TSH [published erratum appears in Endocrinology 1989 Jan;124(1):332]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A sensitive in vitro assay based on the uptake of 125I by the FRTL-5 rat thyroid cell line has been applied to the measurement of TSH bioactivity from different sources. In this bioassay various human pituitary reference preparations showed similar potencies; the limit of detection and the half-maximal response were 1.60 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) and 9.70 +/- 0.40 microU/0.5 ml, respectively; however, when compared to pituitary TSH from other species, human TSH was 29- and 10-fold less biopotent than bovine and rat TSH, respectively. The iodide uptake response to TSH was inhibited by the presence of human serum in a dose-dependent fashion, but pretreatment of serum with 10% polyethylene glycol restored TSH activity. The iodide uptake response was compared to the stimulation of cAMP production in the measurement of serum TSH bioactivity from human samples after immunoaffinity purification. In the cAMP production bioassay, immunoaffinity-purified serum TSH showed increased bioactivity in patients with primary hypothyroidism and TSH-secreting pituitary tumor compared to that in normal subjects, while in the iodide uptake bioassay minimal differences were detected among the different groups. To investigate further structure-function relationships of TSH in FRTL-5 cells we studied the effects of deglycosylated purified pituitary bovine and human TSH on both bioassays. Using two new enzymes, peptide-N-glycosidase and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F, we removed one carbohydrate chain from TSH alpha and all three chains from TSH, respectively. In the iodide uptake bioassay both enzymes induced a 2-fold decrease in TSH biopotency, while in the cAMP production bioassay this decrease was only present with peptide-N-glycosidase-treated TSH. In summary, 1) the iodide uptake bioassay system in FRTL-5 cells represents a valid and sensitive method for the measurement of TSH bioactivity from different sources and can be applied to serum samples with elevated TSH concentrations by simple pretreatment with polyethylene glycol without immunoaffinity purification; 2) the enzymatic removal of one carbohydrate chain from both bovine and human TSH significantly decrease their biological activity, assessed as cAMP production and iodide uptake response in FRTL-5 cells, while the removal of three carbohydrate chains induces a significant decrease only in the iodide uptake bioassay: and 3) the disparate results for cAMP and iodide uptake in both human samples and deglycosylated pituitary TSH suggest that in addition to cAMP, other second messengers may play a role in TSH action.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Characterization and hormonal regulation of estrogen binding proteins in the MTW-9B transplantable rat mammary tumor.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A two-component estrogen (E2)-binding system has been characterized in the E2-independent MTW-9B rat mammary tumor by Scatchard analysis, sucrose gradient analysis, and isoelectric focusing. One cytosol receptor protein (type I) conforms to the classical estrogen receptor with a high affinity (Kd = 0.45 nM) for E2 and limited binding capacity [maximum binding (Bmax) = 53 fmol/mg protein]. The second component (type II) demonstrates a high number of sites (Bmax = 164 fmol/mg protein) and low E2-binding affinity (Kd = 22.3 nM). The type I and type II E2-binding components were shown to sediment on sucrose gradients at 9.6S and 4.5S, respectively, and to focus at isoelectric points of 6.6 and 8.0, respectively. The addition of 0.4 M KCl to the homogenization buffer converted the high affinity receptor species to a form that cosedimented and cofocused with the low affinity E2-binding protein. When tumors were grown in intact male rats, the ratio of the type II to the type I protein, as assessed by sucrose gradient analysis, increased 4.5-fold relative to that in tumors from intact females. Concomitantly, the Kd values of the type I and type II proteins were increased 9- and 2-fold, respectively, and the Bmax of the type I protein was decreased. No changes in the ratios of the E2-binding proteins were observed in tumors grown in ovariectomized female or castrated male rats; however, the Kd for both proteins was increased in tumors from the latter group. Relative to that in intact females, tumor growth was retarded in intact male rats, but was unaffected by ovariectomy or castration. These studies demonstrate that the presence of the low affinity E2-binding protein does not necessarily predict E2 responsiveness. While the role of the type II cytosolic protein has not yet been established, it is possible that it could act as a reservoir for E2, which is required to activate specific biochemical functions such as progesterone receptor synthesis. Alternatively, it could be a nonactivated, perhaps norphosphorylated, form of the E2 receptor which binds E2 with only a very low affinity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Proenkephalin gene expression in the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line: stimulation by sodium butyrate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The differentiation promoter sodium butyrate increases the content of Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (Met5-enk-RGL)-immunoreactive peptides in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, which, unlike mature adrenomedullary chromaffin cells, contain exceedingly low levels of opioid peptides. These butyrate-induced enkephalin-immunoreactive peptides, which are specific products of the proenkephalin gene, consist principally of two high mol wt forms of amino-terminally extended Met5-enk-RGL. These high mol wt peptides, with apparent mol wt of 20,000 and 10,000, are approximately the same size as the two major immunoreactive peptides found in adult New England Deaconess Hospital rat adrenal. The low mol wt Met5-enk-RGL-immunoreactive peptide found in butyrate-treated cells is similar in size to authentic Met5-enk-RGL, which is not found in the adrenal medulla of the adult rat. When PC12 cells are grown as a tumor in vivo, the amount of Met5-enk-RGL-immunoreactive peptide increased only slightly above the level found in control cells grown in vitro and consisted exclusively of the highest mol wt immunoreactive species. In PC12 cells, the butyrate-stimulated elevation in the content of Met5-enk-RGL-immunoreactive peptides may involve changes in transcription, since the peptide increase is preceded by a 2- to 3-fold increase in the level of proenkephalin mRNA. These results suggest that the PC12 cell line may be useful for investigating those factors that control the initial expression and processing of proenkephalin-derived peptides during embryogenesis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Developmental expression of the angiotensinogen gene in rat embryos.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Angiotensin II is a potent octapeptide vasoconstrictor and regulator of cardiovascular and electrolyte homeostasis. Angiotensinogen, the protein precursor of angiotensin II, is synthesized by the liver and many other organs of the adult rat. To determine whether angiotensin may be present in early fetal development we analyzed rat embryonic tissues (chorionic membranes, head, and body) for the expression of the angiotensinogen gene during days 11-21 of embryogenesis. Angiotensinogen mRNA was detected at low levels in embryo bodies and yolk sac placenta from day 11 of gestation. An initial rise in the level was noted on day 13, reaching a plateau from day 17 of gestation to birth. Angiotensinogen mRNA levels of the embryonic head were about 10-fold less than those of the body on days 17-19 and increased to levels similar to those of the body on days 20-21. Angiotensinogen mRNA levels of the yolk sac placenta were about 20-fold higher than those in the embryonic body, but no angiotensinogen mRNA was detected in the chorioallantoic placenta. Angiotensinogen mRNA from both embryos and yolk sac placenta was larger by about 200 bases than the mRNA obtained from adult rat liver; this was shown to be a consequence of both the utilization of more distal polyadenylation sites and a longer poly(A) tract. These observations suggest the possibility of a biological function for angiotensinogen in the early development of the rat, and that polyadenylation site selection may alter the functional expression of the angiotensinogen gene in a developmentally specific manner.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Estradiol stimulation of glucose transport in rat uterus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Glucose transport in rat uterus was investigated in order to determine whether the stimulation of transport by estradiol was the result of an increase in the amount of glucose transport protein in plasma membranes. In cycling rats, transport was highest during proestrus, the day on which serum estradiol concentrations are highest. In ovariectomized rats, the stimulation of transport was estrogen specific and was nearly complete within 2-3 h after injection of 0.1 microgram estradiol per animal. Estradiol stimulation resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in Vmax of 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport with no significant change in Michaelis-Menten constant (Km). Inhibition of the stimulation by cycloheximide or actinomycin D could not be demonstrated, although cycloheximide treatment did cause an increase in the basal rate of transport up to that observed with estradiol treatment. Upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting, a single protein in uterine plasma membranes reacted with a rabbit antiserum made against purified human erythrocyte glucose transport protein. This protein, believed to be the glucose transport protein, had a mol wt of 49,000 and appeared as a broad band as expected for a glycoprotein. It was found by a protein A-linked immunoassay that the amount of transport protein in uterine plasma membranes was 3.2 +/- 0.4% of the amount in human erythrocyte ghosts. Estradiol treatment had no effect on this value. These data suggest that the stimulation of glucose transport by estradiol occurred by an increase in the intrinsic activity of the transport protein rather than by an increase in the amount of transport protein in plasma membranes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of the progesterone antagonist RU486 on ovarian activity in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Adult female rats were treated for 2 or 4 weeks with the progesterone antagonist RU486 to study its effect on the regulation of ovarian function. In rats with 5-day ovarian cycles, the vaginal cyclicity disappeared. Uninterrupted vaginal cornification emerged within 4 days after the start of treatment and cornification persisted for the whole period of treatment. It took more than 2 weeks after cessation of 2-4 weeks of treatment before 5-day vaginal cycles reappeared. Ovarian weights increased rapidly resulting from the accumulation of large numbers of corpora lutea. In addition, the ovaries developed occasional follicular cysts which could reach an extremely large size (2 mm or more). Analysis of serial histological sections of ovaries, combined with plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta and progesterone, indicated cyclic ovulation and corpus luteum formation together with persistence of functional activity of already existing and newly formed corpora lutea. RU486 seems to have the unique property of dissociating cessation of luteal activity and ovulation in rats. After treatment with RU486, pituitary enlargement and mammary gland alveolar development were observed. It is hypothesized that these effects result from unopposed estrogen action on PRL secretion. The effects of RU486 are reversible: 4 to 5 weeks after the end of treatment ovarian activity seems normal (as evidenced by reduction of ovarian weights and 5-day vaginal cycles) except for the presence of occasional large follicular cysts which may require longer periods for their regression.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cysteamine-induced decrease of somatostatin in rat brain synaptosomes in vitro.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The mechanism of somatostatin depletion induced by cysteamine [2-mercaptoethylamine (CySH)] was studied in isolated nerve endings (synaptosomes) from rat brain in vitro. A dose-dependent reduction of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) was observed which reached its maximal extent (41%) at a concentration of 300 microM CySH after 1-5 min. There was no release of somatostatin into the incubation medium. CySH at concentrations of up to 10 mM did not interfere in the RIA. Among a variety of compounds, structurally related to CySH 4-aminothiophenol, 2-aminothiophenol and N,N-dimethylaminothiol exhibited the highest efficacy in decreasing somatostatin (60%, 50%, 30%, respectively, at 10 mM and 10 min). The disulfide form of CySH cystamine and dimercaprol resulted in about 15% reduction after 10-min incubation, whereas taurine, alanine, cysteine, and mercaptoethanol were inactive. A saturable, sodium-dependent uptake process was found for the disulfide form of [35S]CySH cystamine [Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) = 18.6 microM, maximum velocity (Vmax) = 2.3 nmol/mg protein X 3 min) which was inhibited by cysteine (87% at 1 mM). [35S]CySH, at concentrations of 20 microM or less, was not stable in buffer solution. It underwent considerable nonenzymatic conversion into its dimeric form (60% at 37 C and 3 min), however it exhibited the same kinetic data for its uptake. Size exclusion HPLC of purified hypothalamic synaptosomes revealed a major SLI peak coeluting with synthetic somatostatin-14 and two minor peaks representing somatostatin-28 and a 13,000 mol wt protein. The three molecular forms of somatostatin were reduced to varied extent by CySH (somatostatin-14 by about 70%, somatostatin-28 by 15%, and the high mol wt form by 30%). Our experiments suggest that high affinity uptake of CySH may precede its action in decreasing somatostatin levels. Increased release or inhibition of synthesis of somatostatin have been excluded as possible mechanisms. It is suggested that SLI is equally affected in nerve endings and in perikarya.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Steroid synthesis-dependent, oxygen-mediated damage of mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzymes in rat Leydig cell cultures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Treatment of primary cultures of rat Leydig cells with 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP for 2 days at ambient oxygen tension (19%) caused a 59% decrease in mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P-450scc) activity. This decrease was completely prevented when the oxygen tension was reduced to 1% O2 or when steroid synthesis was inhibited by aminoglutethimide. When the endogenous concentration of pregnenolone was increased by inhibiting its further metabolism, P-450scc activity was reduced by 80% in unstimulated cultures and was completely eliminated in cAMP-treated cultures. These losses were prevented when cells were maintained at 1% O2. The amount of immunoreactive P-450scc was also decreased by treatments that reduced P-450scc activity. Stimulation with cAMP also lowered microsomal C17-20 lyase activity by an oxygen-mediated, steroid synthesis-dependent mechanism. Treatment of cultures with testosterone caused a similar oxygen tension-sensitive decrease in C17-20 lyase activity. These results suggest that the enhanced loss of mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome P-450 activities in cAMP-treated cultures is caused by the increased production of pregnenolone and testosterone, respectively, which generate reactive damaging species derived from reduced dioxygen. The increased catalytic turnover of these P-450 enzymes may also contribute to their damage. Although P-450 activities were preserved at 1% O2, the ability of cAMP-treated cells to synthesize testosterone in response to subsequent cAMP stimulation was still reduced. If, however, 25-hydroxycholesterol was supplied to these cells the decrease in testosterone-producing capacity was prevented, which demonstrates that the reduced steroidogenic capacity of cAMP-treated Leydig cells is caused, primarily, by the reduced availability of endogenous cholesterol.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A morphometric analysis of adrenocortical actin localized by immunoelectron microscopy: the effect of adrenocorticotropin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The localization of actin and the effect of ACTH on its concentration was examined in freshly isolated rat adrenocortical cells. Lowicryl K4M-embedded cells were used for the immunoelectron localization of actin; gold was used as a label for immunoreactive sites. Actin was at least 4 times as concentrated at the cortical cytoplasm as in the lipid droplets and at least 5 times as concentrated in the microvilli as in the lipid droplets. ACTH stimulation approximately doubled the concentration of actin in the cortical cytoplasm and increased by 50% the concentration of actin in the microvilli. The microvillar contribution to the cell surface area was 40% higher in ACTH-stimulated cells than it was in unstimulated cells. These results provide quantitative evidence suggesting that actin and the microvilli participate in steroid secretion by the adrenocortical cell.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Species-specificity of corticosteroid receptors in hamster and rat brains.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In vitro cytosolic receptor binding assays and autoradiographical procedures have shown the localization and properties of two corticoid receptor types in the brain of the rat, a species in which corticosterone (B) is the predominant circulating glucocorticoid. The present study was designed to examine the localization, heterogeneity, and binding specificity of corticosteroid receptors in the brain of the hamster, a species which secretes B and cortisol (F), the latter being the predominantly circulating form. Our results show that two corticoid receptor systems can also be distinguished in the hamster brain. The type I receptor has an almost exclusive localization in the hippocampal region and the amounts measured in hypothalamic or whole brain (without the hippocampus) were negligible. The type II receptor, on the other hand, has a wider distribution in the brain. Scatchard and Woolf analyses of the binding data revealed that the hamster type I receptor has similar affinity to both F and B [dissociation constant (Kd) 0.9 nM]. In contrast the rat type I binds with higher affinity to B (Kd, 0.9 nM) than to F (Kd, 2.2 nM). The hamster type II binds to F with much higher affinity (Kd, 2.9 nM) than does the rat type II to F (Kd, 20.1 nM). This was similarly observed, although less pronounced in the binding of the hamster type II and the rat type II to B (Kd, 0.5 and 3.9 nM, respectively). Analysis of relative binding affinity of each receptor type gave the following results. Hamster type I: F greater than B much greater than aldosterone (ALDO) greater than dexamethasone (DEX); rat type I: B greater than F greater than ALDO greater than DEX; hamster type II: B greater than DEX greater than F much greater than ALDO; rat type II: DEX greater than B much greater than F much greater than ALDO. Graded doses of F or B given sc to adrenalectomized animals result in differential occupancy of the two receptor systems. In hamster, 1.0 microgram F vs. 1.0 mg B/100 g BW is required to occupy 80% of type I site. The rat shows the opposite (1.0 microgram B vs. 5.0 to 10.0 mg F/100 g BW to occupy type I to the same extent). The hamster type II is 80-90% occupied by an equal dose of F or B (1.0 mg/100 g BW) whereas in the rat, F at 5-10 mg/100 g BW (doses 5-10 times that of B) is required to achieve this same occupancy.

<TITLE>- Inhibitory effect of the ovaries on neonatal androgen imprinting of growth hormone secretion in female rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of neonatal androgen treatment on the GH secretory pattern was examined in intact and ovariectomized adult female rats. Neonatal ovariectomy or sham operation was performed at 1-2 days of age; thereafter, the animals were immediately given testosterone propionate (250 micrograms) or vehicle. Other rats, also treated neonatally with testosterone, were ovariectomized 15-22 days before blood sampling. Plasma GH was measured in blood samples obtained from indwelling intraatrial cannulae every 20 min for 8 h when the animals were 100-140 days old. Plasma GH secretory patterns were analyzed by a pulse analysis computer program (PULSAR). Neonatal testosterone treatment did not affect the GH secretory pattern of female rats with intact ovaries. In contrast, neonatal androgen treatment enhanced GH pulse height as well as mean GH concentration in neonatally ovariectomized female rats to levels comparable to those in intact male rats. Neonatal testosterone administration also significantly increased GH pulse height and mean plasma GH concentration in female rats that were ovariectomized during adulthood. However, the GH secretory pattern of ovariectomized female rats given testosterone neonatally still differed markedly from that of normal males, in that GH pulses occurred less regularly and baseline levels were higher. Pituitary GH content and concentration in neonatally ovariectomized female rats were increased to levels indistinguishable from those in male rats by neonatal testosterone treatment. No significant effect of neonatal testosterone was observed in sham-operated females. Neonatal ovariectomy decreased basal plasma GH levels, but did not affect plasma GH pulse height or pituitary GH levels. The serum estradiol concentration was markedly decreased in ovariectomized female rats, but was unchanged in sham-operated rats given neonatal testosterone, raising the possibility that serum estradiol secretion mediated the antagonistic effect of the ovaries on neonatal androgen imprinting. These results indicate that the presence of ovaries can prevent the stimulatory effect of neonatal androgen exposure on GH storage and secretion in adult female rats.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cortisone, testosterone, and aldosterone reduce levels of nerve growth factor messenger ribonucleic acid in L-929 fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous studies have shown that steroid hormones reduce concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF) in medium conditioned by L-929 fibroblasts (L cells). In this study, we extend those observations and have measured in L cells the effects of hormone treatment on mRNA encoding NGF. L Cells were grown for 3 days in the presence or absence of hormones. NGF in conditioned medium was measured by NGF RIA; NGF mRNA was measured in cell extracts by Northern blot analysis. Cortisone reduced NGF levels in conditioned medium below the limit of detection of the RIA (less than 10% of control values) with an ED50 of 5 X 10(-9) M; NGF mRNA was reduced to 12% of control levels with an ED50 of 1 X 10(-8) M. Reductions in mRNA were maximal within 3 h and were completely reversed 12 h after removal of the hormone. Levels of NGF in conditioned medium were also undetectable in cultures treated with testosterone, and mRNA levels were reduced by 80%; the ED50 for both effects was 4 X 10(-9) M. Aldosterone (1 X 10(-6) M) reduced NGF to below detectable levels and NGF mRNA by 70%. Progesterone and thyroid hormone had no effect on NGF or NGF mRNA. 17 beta-Estradiol reduced levels of NGF in medium by 50%, but had no detectable effect on levels of NGF mRNA. These results suggest that cortisone, testosterone, and aldosterone decrease NGF levels in L cell-conditioned medium by reducing the cellular content of NGF mRNA.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Decreased potency of glucagon on transformed-induced MDCK cells does not reflect an alteration of adenylate cyclase components.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The selective loss of glucagon sensitivity of transformed MDCK cells can be restored by differentiation inducers, a process which requires RNA and protein synthesis and glycosylation. Although the glucagon dose-response curve of normal MDCK cells resembled that of liver and kidney (Kact = 10 nM), the transformed-induced cells were 10-fold less sensitive to the hormone [activation constant (Kact) = 100 nM]. Additionally, the stimulation of cAMP synthesis by a glucagon fragment (glucagon) in transformed-induced cells was greatly reduced compared to normal cells. The adenylate cyclase regulatory components of transformed-induced MDCK cell membranes seemed unaltered compared to the parental line. Both contained equivalent amounts of cholera and pertussis toxin substrates, and soluble extracts were equally capable of reconstituting isoproterenol responsiveness of S49 cyc- membranes. However, membrane fusion studies demonstrated that the glucagon sensitivity of transformed-induced membranes could not be reconstituted with heterologous membranes. When donor transformed-induced membranes (with inactivated adenylate cyclase) were fused with acceptor HeLa membranes (normally unresponsive to glucagon and prostaglandin E), such hybrids were unresponsive to glucagon, although responsiveness to prostaglandin E was evident. Parallel hybrids with normal MDCK membranes were responsive to both glucagon and prostaglandin E. This difference could not be explained by an inhibitory effect of transformed-induced membranes on receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling under the fusion conditions: the ability of these membranes to serve as an acceptor for the reconstitution of vasoactive intestinal peptide responsiveness was identical to that of normal MDCK cells. The data suggest that the glucagon sensitivity induced in transformed MDCK cells differs significantly from that of the parental line. However, these differences cannot be explained by alterations of transformed-induced membrane components relevant to the coupling of hormone receptors to adenylate cyclase.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The insulin receptors of chick embryo show tissue-specific structural differences which parallel those of the insulin-like growth factor I receptors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Since specific binding to receptors and biological effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are demonstrable soon after the neural tube closes and organogenesis begins in the chick embryo, in the present study we have analyzed the structural characteristics and specificity of the receptors for insulin and IGFs at this early stage of development. We show that membranes from newly differentiated chick embryo tissues (day 6 brain, day 6 heart, day 8 liver, day 12 skeletal muscle) as well as whole embryos postneurulation (day 2, stage of 27-30 somites) have two populations of receptors with distinct specificity: insulin and type I IGF (IGF-I) receptors. Both insulin and IGF-I alpha-subunits, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, had tissue-dependent heterogeneity in Mr (liver greater than heart = skeletal muscle greater than brain) ranging from 138 kilodaltons (kDa) to 129 kDa. Desialylation of the receptors by treatment with neuraminidase produced a significant change in the Mr of the alpha-subunits in liver and heart but not in brain or the whole day 2 embryo. In each tissue the pattern for insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors was strikingly similar. Our studies raise the possibility that postranslational modifications of the insulin and IGF-I receptors, characteristic of terminally differentiated tissues, are already present in early organogenesis. Further, structural heterogeneity of the binding subunit of these receptors among tissues appears to be widespread and not exclusive to the brain receptor. An insulin receptor with features similar to the neural type is the only one detected in embryos at the beginning of organogenesis (day 2). The functional implication of this developmental tissue-specific regulation of insulin and IGF-I receptors, is still speculative. Its possible importance is suggested by the fact that it occurs embryologically early and affects both insulin and IGF-I receptors in parallel.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Identification of amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange in rat NB2 node lymphoma cells. Stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Stimulation of mitogenesis in rat Nb2 node lymphoma cells by human (h) PRL was inhibited by inhibitors of Na+/H+ exchange (viz. amiloride and its analogs) and inhibitors of protein kinases (isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives). The most potent were ethylisopropylamiloride (EP-Am) (IC50, 13 microM) and H-7, selective for protein kinase C (IC50, 23 microM), suggesting the possible involvement of Na+/H+ exchange and protein kinase C in mediating Nb2 cell mitogenesis. In the presence of hPRL, the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to activate the Na+/H+ antiporter as well as protein kinase C in other cell systems, enhanced the hPRL-stimulated Nb2 cell mitogenesis. TPA alone caused a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of H+ efflux in stationary cultures of Nb2 cells but had no effect on cell growth. From 25-100 nM TPA, the increase in the rate of H+ efflux was detectable by 3 min, reached a maximum by 15 min, and was sustained 30 min after the addition of TPA. The TPA-stimulated H+ efflux was dependent on extracellular Na+ and was almost completely inhibited after a 10 min preincubation with 25 microM EP-Am. TPA also increased the intracellular pH (pHi) of stationary cultures of Nb2 cells from 7.29 +/- 0.02 (n = 8) to a maximum of 7.45 +/- 0.03 (n = 10). The most rapid and greatest response was observed with 40 nM TPA which gave a detectable increase in pHi within 1 min and reached a maximum alkalinization by 6 min. Higher concentrations of TPA had no additional effect. The nontumor promoter phorbol 12,13,20-triacetate (PTA), either alone or in the presence of hPRL, had no effect on Nb2 cell proliferation or on H+ efflux or pHi in Hb2 cells. The TPA-induced increase in pHi was Na+-dependent and was inhibited by EP-Am and H-7. A preincubation with EP-Am (25 microM) for 5-10 min abolished the TPA-induced increase in pHi whereas prolonged incubation with H-7 (50 microM) for up to 3 h was required to decrease the stimulatory effect of TPA by approximately 50%. Although activation of the Na+/H+ exchange system is clearly an early consequence of the action of TPA on Nb2 cells, the failure of TPA to stimulate Nb2 cell proliferation suggests that stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange and protein kinase C activity are not sufficient to generate a mitogenic response in these cells.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange in rat NB2 node lymphoma cells. Stimulation by prolactin and other mitogens.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Human PRL (hPRL) stimulated an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange system, measured as extracellular acidification or rate of H+ efflux, uptake of 22Na+, and intracellular alkalinization (pHi) in rat Nb2 node lymphoma cells. The hPRL-induced increase in H+ efflux rate was dependent on dose, time, and the concentration of extracellular Na+. From 5-100 ng/ml, the hPRL-induced increase in H+ efflux rate was measurable by 3 min and reached a dose-dependent maximum by 15 min. A higher final H+ efflux rate was achieved with a higher concentration of hPRL. Complete replacement of Na+ by choline chloride gave a marginal increase in the rate of H+ efflux upon addition of hPRL. At a maximum noncytotoxic concentration (25 microM), the potent amiloride analog, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EP-Am), decreased but did not abolish, the stimulatory effect of hPRL. The hPRL-stimulated increase in H+ efflux rate was accompanied by an EP-Am-sensitive uptake of 22Na+ in acid-loaded (pHi = 6.2) Nb2 cells as well as EP-Am sensitive and extracellular Na+-dependent increase in pHi. One minute after the addition of hPRL (5 ng/ml), there was a significant increase in (P less than 0.01) 22Na+ uptake over the hormonally untreated controls. Addition of hPRL (5 and 10 ng/ml) to Nb2 cells induced a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in pHi within 4 min, while with a higher concentration of 30 ng/ml the increase was significant by 1 min. In all cases, the pHi was raised from a resting value of 7.29 +/- 0.02 (n = 8) to a maximum of 7.45 +/- 0.02 (n = 8). The hPRL-stimulated increase in pHi was abolished in Nb2 cells preincubated for 5-10 min with EP-Am (25 microM) before the addition of the hormone. Activation of Na+/H+ exchange in Nb2 cells was also achieved with human recombinant interleukin 2 and guinea pig antiserum to PRL receptors. In each case, there was a dose- and time-dependent increase in H+ efflux rate which was detectable by 3 min. However, both antiserum to PRL receptor (n = 4) and interleukin 2 (n = 6) raised pHi to a maximum of only 7.35 +/- 0.01. The Na+/H+ exchange system in Nb2 cells was also activated by osmotic shocking, rapidly raising pHi to 7.45 +/- 0.01 (n = 3). Activation was abolished by EP-Am. Contrary to these observations, rat GH which is not mitogenic did not have an effect on pHi in Nb2 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Processing of growth hormone by rat adipocytes in primary culture: differentiation between release of intact hormone and degradative processing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Rat adipocytes in primary culture have been used to study the intracellular processing of GH. These classic target cells for GH have been shown to process GH through two pathways: a nondegradative pathway which resulted in the rapid release of intact GH, and a slower, degradative pathway which involved the degradation of GH and release of degraded ligand. Differentiation between the two pathways was on the basis of differences in their kinetics and temperature dependence. The present study has investigated the relative characteristics of the two pathways further. Incubation of [125I]human GH ([125I]hGH)-preloaded adipocytes with extracellular unlabeled hGH (400 ng/ml) resulted in an increase in the absolute amount of [125I]hGH released. The increased amount of [125I]hGH released was all intact. Extracellular, unlabeled hGH had no effect on the rate or amount of degraded [125I]hGH released. This suggests that the nondegradative pathway is sensitive to the number of internalized hormone-receptor complexes and that GH which is not immediately degraded or stored in the degradative pathway, is redirected and processed via the faster non-degradative pathway. Ammonium chloride (known to inhibit the lysosomal degradation of many polypeptide hormones) markedly inhibited the absolute amount of [125I]hGH released from preloaded adipocytes. This inhibition was due to an effect on the release of degraded [125I]hGH. NH4Cl had no effect on the rate or amount of intact [125I]hGH released. Finally, it was found that dinitrophenol and sodium fluoride (agents known to deplete cellular energy) inhibited the release of degraded GH but not intact GH suggesting that the degradative pathway involves an energy-dependent step, most likely the fusion of hormone-containing vesicles with the lysosomal membrane. The mechanism of release of intact hormone by energy-independent means is not yet known. These data indicate that the processing of GH by cultured rat adipocytes is complex and involves at least two independently regulated pathways, a predominant degradative route and a nondegradative route. Further studies are required to assess the possible roles of these pathways in the metabolic actions of GH in adipocytes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adrenocorticotropin-adrenal regulation of transported substance P in the vagus nerve of the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The factors regulating substance P (SP) synthesis and quantity of transport in the sensory vagus nerve are unknown. To examine this issue rats were administered ACTH or corticosterone or subjected to adrenalectomy, and the quantity of peripherally directed transported SP was measured in those animals as an indication of neuropeptide synthesis. ACTH treatment (12 U/day, sc, for 14 days) resulted in significant adrenal hypertrophy and increased corticosterone levels. The 24-h accumulation of SP proximal to ligature in the cervical vagus was significantly reduced [mean net proximal segment content: controls, 529 +/- 42 (+/- SEM) pg/3 mm segment; ACTH, 282 +/- 44]. The content in the unligated nerve, one sixth or less than that proximal to ligature, was not different in the two groups. In a separate experiment, ACTH (6 U/day for 14 days) had no effect compared to controls, whereas 16 U/day reduced transported SP. The content in the unligated nerve was again not different in the two groups. In the same experiment, corticosterone (2.5 mg/100 g BW, sc, for 14 days) reduced the quantity of transported SP. Total protein content in proximal segments was reduced only in the corticosterone group and was identical in all groups in unligated nerve. Adrenalectomy modestly increased transport by 20% and contralateral unligated nerve content by a similar percentage. The quantity of transported somatostatin, another vagal neuropeptide partly derived from sensory cell bodies, was either increased or unaltered by the experimental manipulations. In summary, these studies demonstrate that the chronic administration of ACTH or corticosterone significantly decreases the quantity of peripherally transported SP in the sensory vagus nerve and, presumably, synthesis within the vagal sensory ganglia. Down-regulation of synthesized/transported neuropeptide suggests a mechanism by which the ACTH-adrenal axis, acting through visceral sensory nerves, may modulate autonomic or central nervous system vagally mediated reflex arcs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Localization and characterization of insulin receptors in rat brain and pituitary gland using in vitro autoradiography and computerized densitometry.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In order to identify likely sites of action in insulin in rat brain we have used the technique of in vitro autoradiography and computerized densitometry to map, characterize, and quantify its receptors in coronal and sagittal sections. A discrete and characteristic distribution of insulin receptor binding was demonstrated, with specific binding representing 92% of total binding. Displacement and specificity competition curves in olfactory bulb are typical for authentic insulin receptors, and computer analysis indicates a single class of binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) 0.48 nM for choroid plexus and 0.44 nM for olfactory bulb external plexiform layer. Insulin receptor density is maximum in the choroid plexus, and high in the external plexiform layer of olfactory bulb. Structures of the limbic system and hypothalamus reveal moderate to high insulin receptor density, particularly the lateral septum, amygdala, subiculum, hippocampal CA1 region, mammillary body, and arcuate nucleus. Moderate insulin receptor density occurs in regions of cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and moderate to low binding occurs in discrete brainstem and midbrain structures. Insulin binding in the pituitary gland is greatest in the anterior lobe, with clear distinction from intermediate and posterior lobes. The circumventricular organs and the thalamus show low insulin binding. We conclude that insulin receptors are widespread throughout rat brain, with concentration in regions concerned with olfaction, appetite, and autonomic functions. The distribution is distinct from other neuropeptides and not related to either vascularity or cell density. A common feature of regions rich in insulin receptors is that they contain dendritic fields receiving rich synaptic input. Whether insulin plays a specific neurotransmitter or metabolic role in these sites remains unclear, but these studies have provided detailed information on potential sites of action of insulin in the brain, and will allow further studies to examine insulin receptor function in specific brain regions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Observations on the effect of morphine on thalamocortical excitability in the cat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The acute effects of morphine on the thalamocortical augmenting response in the cat were evaluated. The thalamocortical augmenting response was elicited by delivering pairs of pulses to the ventrolateral thalamus and recording from ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. A biphasic, dose-related, naloxone-attenuable effect on the augmenting response elicited by pulse pairs was observed. Although the clinical significance of those morphine-induced changes is currently uncertain, they can be correlated with the convulsant and anticonvulsant effects of different doses of morphine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Brainstem experimental seizures produced by microinjections of carbachol.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Microinjections of 2-10 micrograms of carbachol into the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) and pontine reticular formation (PRF) of rats consistently induced local electroencephalographic seizures. These seizures had organized, rhythmical patterns and were long lasting. They spread powerfully and bilaterally between the MRF and PRF and also to the hippocampus and cortex. The electroencephalographic seizures were accompanied by severe, long-lasting convulsions. These convulsions were clonic and bilateral, started in the head area and progressed rostro-caudally to become generalized to the entire body. Other nonconvulsive behaviors were activated by the seizures. Immobility and catalepsy were the most frequent nonconvulsive correlates of the brainstem carbachol seizures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Timing of seizure recurrence in adult epileptic patients: a statistical analysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seizure diaries were maintained prospectively in 24 epileptic patients (19 with partial complex, three with partial simple, and three with primary generalized seizures) who were selected consecutively, had stable seizure patterns, were reliable historians, and were known to be compliant with medications. Diaries were maintained for an average of 237 days (range, 61-365), and an average of 18 seizures were recorded per patient (range, 5-76). Seizure patterns were analyzed by using the methods appropriate for a time series of events (point process). Two patients had a decreasing trend in seizure frequency. For 12 patients, seizure occurrence was indistinguishable from that of a Poisson process. The remaining 10 patients had an exponential distribution of seizure intervals, but did not fit other criteria for a Poisson process; 3 of these showed evidence for seizure clustering; none showed evidence for a seizure cycle. It is concluded that the pattern of seizure occurrence in most epileptic people is random, but in approximately 50%, it is not occurring according to a Poisson process. These observations indicate that seizure cycling and/or clustering are not common in epileptic patients, but do not exclude the possibility that seizures have been precipitated by some randomly occurring event, such as sleep deprivation or increased stress.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Human hippocampal seizure spread studied by depth and subdural recording: the hippocampal commissure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Eleven patients had seizures with unilateral temporal lobe onset recorded with simultaneous bilateral medial temporal depth electrodes and neocortical (subdural) electrodes at least on the side of seizure onset. Of a total of 55 seizures, four had simultaneous onset in neocortex and hippocampus, and 51 had onset in unilateral hippocampus. None originated solely in temporal neocortex. Three reproducible patterns of seizure spread from hippocampus were defined in which seizures spread initially to ipsilateral neocortex (32 seizures), spread first to contralateral hippocampus (13 seizures), or spread simultaneously to ipsilateral neocortex and contralateral hippocampus. Although the region of hippocampus in which seizures arose was constant, patterns of spread sometimes varied in the same patient. When contralateral neocortical involvement occurred, it was after or with contralateral hippocampus but never before. These results suggest the existence of an operational hippocampal commissure in humans.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Methohexital activation of epileptogenic foci during acute electrocorticography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Methohexital was used as an activating agent in 62 patients undergoing focal cortical resections of epileptogenic foci and in six patients undergoing chronic electroencephalogram (EEG)/video monitoring with intracranial strip electrodes. In 87% of cases, methohexital caused selective activation of the epileptogenic focus during acute electrocorticography (ECoG). This activation appeared to be specific for the epileptogenic focus and did not cause epileptiform spiking from adjacent nonepileptogenic cortex. This ECoG activation occurred whether patients received local or general anesthesia. Sixty-five percent of patients demonstrated adequate activation with as little as 25 mg of drug. Methohexital is a safe and reliable method of activating epileptogenic foci during acute ECoG recordings and can decrease the time for ECoG recordings during surgery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Controlled release carbamazepine: cognitive side effects in patients with epilepsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine (CBZ) may be hampered by cognitive side effects. These side effects are thought to be related to pharmacokinetic properties of the drug. The serum concentration of CBZ is characterized by rapid absorption and a short half-life, which may lead to a considerable fluctuation of the level between doses. Cognitive defects may result from peak levels: short periods with high serum concentration. In a single-blind crossover design, cognitive performance was compared in three conditions. All patients were first tested in the steady state of conventional CBZ. The patients were then assigned randomly to either CBZ-controlled release (CR) or a condition in which conventional CBZ was administered in the same tablet form and dose frequency as CR. Psychological tests were administered four times daily, immediately after the serum samples were taken. A nonmedication control group was tested following the same test scheme to obtain standards for the evaluation of changes in performance during the day. A systematic tendency was found toward higher test performance in the CR condition. This is especially evident for tests of memory and accuracy of visual information processing. The results of the repeated test procedure show that the smoothing effect of the CR condition on serum concentration fluctuations results in a more stable pattern of cognitive functioning during the day.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Carbamazepine-induced nonepileptic myoclonus in a child with benign epilepsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Myoclonic jerks involving the proximal limb musculature and tic-like movements (sniffing, coughing, or sighing) were observed in an 11-year-old boy with benign occipital epilepsy treated with carbamazepine (CBZ). The involuntary movements disappeared a few days after withdrawal of CBZ and reappeared with CBZ reintroduction. Plasma CBZ levels were always within the therapeutic range. Polygraphic studies failed to show any electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during myoclonic jerks. Appearance of nonepileptic myoclonus in epileptic children treated with CBZ should be carefully evaluated to prevent worsening of the clinical picture. The coexistence of other involuntary movements (tics) could suggest the correct diagnosis.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Computed tomography (CT) was performed on 155 patients from a city hospital population who developed seizures after age 20. CT was normal in 58 (37.4%) and abnormal in 97 patients (62.6%). A focal abnormality was seen in 71 patients (45.8%). Lesions potentially correctable by surgery were found in 24 patients (15.4%). As expected, the occurrence of abnormal CTs was higher (73%) in patients with partial seizures. Although CT is undeniably useful in evaluating the cause of seizures, no demonstrable lesion was found in a relatively large number of patients (37.4%).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Disappearing CT lesions in epilepsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A striking but reversible computed tomographic (CT) lesion corresponding to seizure activity is reported in a series of 46 epileptic patients. None of these patients had evidence of tuberculosis or cysticercosis, and all were treated with antiepileptic drugs only. Maximal radiological changes occurred in the area of maximal epileptic discharge; however, multiple lesions were seen in three cases. The CT lesion reappeared with recurrence of the ictus in four cases during follow-up, and this, too, disappeared after complete arrest of the seizures. The clinical, CT scan, and other investigatory findings suggest that the seizures may occasionally cause a CT-demonstrable focal abnormality, probably cerebral edema, a consequence of abnormal vascular permeability. Awareness of this radiological entity should avoid misdiagnosis of cerebral tumor, infarction or tuberculoma in patients with seizure disorder.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Transient focal abnormalities of neuroimaging studies during focal status epilepticus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We report transient changes in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in a patient with focal status epilepticus, referred to us with a tentative diagnosis of neoplasm based on CT and angiographic findings. EEG seizures originated independently from each temporal-occipital area, predominantly from the right. Previous EEGs had shown almost exclusively right temporo-occipital epileptogenic activity. MRI showed increased signal intensity, and CT showed decreased right hemisphere attenuation without enhancement. One month later, there was resolution of the radiological and clinical abnormalities. The transient CT and MRI changes probably represented focal cerebral edema, developing during focal status epilepticus. Lack of change in the left hemisphere probably reflected the quantitative difference in epileptic activity. Clues to the diagnosis of focal edema due to status include: (1) changes on electrical and imaging studies that correlate anatomically with the clinical status, and (2) resolution of abnormalities with appropriate seizure control. In patients with suspected seizure disorders, electrical and clinical data should be correlated before interpretation is made of focal lesions seen by neuroimaging techniques.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges--long-term outcome in adults.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We reviewed the long-term outcome of 39 adults whose electroencephalograms (EEGs) showed acute periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). Parameters studied included outcome, presence or absence of a seizure disorder (both prior to and subsequent to the PLEDs), seizure type and frequency, and etiology of the PLEDs. The mortality rate was 41%, as 16 of 39 patients died during their hospitalization or within 2 months of discharge. Of the 23 survivors, 7 (30%) had a significant decline in their ability to provide self-care. A recent stroke (13 patients, 33%) was the most frequent cause of PLEDs. In this subgroup particularly, poor outcome, i.e., death or functional decline, was common (10 of 13 patients). Thirty-six patients had seizures just prior to or during the hospitalization when PLEDs were observed; focal motor seizures were the most common type (n = 22). Patients with a history of seizures prior to the occurrence of PLEDs continued to have seizures following discharge. In addition, 4 of 9 patients with new onset seizures associated with PLEDs had subsequent seizures.</ABSTRACT>

- The temporal behavior of neonatal seizures caused by diverse acute encephalopathies in 42 patients with 487 seizures was studied. All 487 seizures were confirmed by typical ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. Neonatal seizures are relatively brief events, which usually last about 2 min. They are recurrent and are separated by interictal recovery periods of variable duration, on the average, about 8 min. Solitary prolonged seizures are rare and do not represent the usual behavior of neonatal seizures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Epilepsy in adolescence: implications for the development of personality.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sixteen adolescent children with onset of epilepsy between the ages of 1 and 12 years and 16 control children were investigated by interview, self-esteem scales, and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Children with epilepsy had a significantly larger discrepancy between the self-image and the ideal self-image than did the control children. TAT indicated the body and self-image is poorer, the unknown and the risk of acting out more threatening, the sex identity less stable, and the defense not as adaptive as the control group. Persons suffering from epilepsy are often stigmatized. One explanation could be the influence of epilepsy on the development during adolescence of the basic trust of their bodies and of themselves.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Memory function and verbal learning ability in patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A variety of experimental paradigms have been utilized to study verbal learning and memory ability in patients with epilepsy. One commonly used paradigm, the free recall of a list(s) of related or unrelated words, has revealed a variety of performance anomalies in patients with complex partial seizures (CPS) of temporal lobe origin, but published studies have varied markedly in important methodological details, making it difficult to interpret discrepant findings as well as to assess the generalizability of results. The purpose of this investigation was to simultaneously inquire into several aspects of verbal learning and memory function that have been reported or hypothesized to be compromised in individuals with CPS of left temporal lobe origin. Thirty patients with CPS of lateralized temporal lobe onset [15 left temporal (LT) and 15 right temporal (RT)] were compared with 15 matched controls (NC) on several measures derived from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), i.e., verbal learning ability, immediate free recall, presence of retroactive interference effects, semantic organization, retrieval efficiency, and recognition memory. Compared to RT and NC groups, the LT patients manifested poorer verbal learning ability, impaired immediate memory, and increased difficulty in the retrieval of verbal material from memory store. Compared to NC subjects, the LT group showed poorer semantic organization in their verbal learning and recall. The RT and NC groups were essentially similar in all respects. Finally, the clinical utility of these findings were investigated, and a series of decision rules designed to separate LT from RT patients was derived.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Errors and corrections made by 64 mildly epileptic children of at least average intelligence who were attending ordinary elementary schools when writing in response to dictation (writing-to-dictation) were assigned to one of 28 descriptive error categories. Numbers and types of errors were compared with those obtained in 630 form-matched, healthy control subjects (Wilcoxon's two-sample test, less than or equal to 0.01). Epileptic children made significantly more errors than control subjects. Separate error categories had no diagnostic power. The groups could not be distinguished on the basis of skill-related errors. However, performance errors (erroneous deviations from the intended product), were found to be made more frequently by epileptic children. Epileptic children made more corrections and also left more errors uncorrected than control children. No relationship could be established with illness variables. Deficient problem-solving strategies, probably resulting from emotional concomitants of epilepsy, may explain the results.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Differential response of growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin to seizures and to stress.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH), cortisol, and prolactin (PRL), following a spontaneous generalized seizure in epileptic men were compared with similar measurements made in nonepileptic, stressed men to determine the role of stress in the hormonal response to seizures. Nonepileptic, nonstressed men served as control subjects. GH concentrations increased significantly within 60 min postictally, and as expected, so did cortisol and PRL. A subgroup of alcoholic patients exhibited a smaller GH response to seizures. Stressed patients had significantly less elevated cortisol and PRL plasma values, but no rise of GH. The data suggest that neurogenic stimuli responsible for the postictal release of GH, cortisol, and PRL are, at least in part, independent of stress mechanisms and that GH response is blunted in alcoholic patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effects of estrogen, progesterone, and ionized calcium on seizures during the menstrual cycle of epileptic women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous research suggested a positive relationship between levels of serum estrogen and seizures, a negative relationship between levels of serum Ca++ and seizures, and a negative relationship between serum levels of estrogen and Ca++. This study sought a relationship between levels of serum estrogen, ionized calcium, progesterone, and its possible effect on seizures during the menstrual cycle of epileptic women. The negative relationship between serum estrogen and Ca++ was confirmed. However, a study of 15 institutionalized epileptic women, all with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy, demonstrated that fewer seizures occurred in midcycle (when estrogen levels were elevated and Ca++ levels were decreased) than at other stages of the menstrual cycle. This is suggestive of a protective (anticonvulsant) aspect of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal negative feedback system, previously unreported.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of candidates for sterilization reversal.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An algorithm that avoids preliminary laparoscopy for sterilization reversal (SR) candidates with previous Pomeroy, loop, Hulka clip, Irving, and single-burn cautery tubal ligation techniques was used. Anastomosis was attempted only when it could be anticipated that the final length of at least one tube would be 3 cm or more. Of 259 SR candidates evaluated according to the algorithm, 235 had SR procedures. Seven of 185 patients (3.8%) who did not undergo laparoscopy were found to have inoperable tubes at laparotomy. Four of these patients had histories of a prior unilateral salpingectomy. The authors conclude that, given their criteria for proceeding with tubal anastomosis, laparoscopy can be avoided in properly selected SR candidates. The results also indicate that patients with a history of unilateral salpingectomy should undergo preliminary laparoscopy.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Long-term bromocriptine treatment was discontinued in 75 hyperprolactinemic women. Bromocriptine had been given for up to 65 months (median, 24 months). Treatment was reinstituted in 42 women (56%) after 1 to 3 months, mainly because of increasing prolactin levels. Thirty-three women (44%) were followed up for 6 months or more without treatment. Menstrual bleeding occurred in 19 of the 33 women (58%) after 6 months without treatment. The mean prolactin concentration in this group had decreased more than 60% compared with pretherapy concentrations. In 18 of the 42 women who had bromocriptine therapy again, treatment was discontinued a second time. Six of these patients have regular menstrual bleeding. Long-term bromocriptine treatment seems to induce long-standing normalization of prolactin secretion in patients with hyperprolactinemia.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Twelve hyperprolactinemic women were administered the alpha aminoergoline derivative, CU 32-085 (Sandoz, Inc., East Hanover, NJ), in order to determine its effect on prolactin (PRL) secretion. The mean pretreatment serum PRL level was 145.0 +/- 11.5 ng/ml. Significant declines of serum PRL occurred with total daily doses of CU 32-085 of 0.1 to 0.5 mg (P less than 0.001). The magnitude of response to therapy was dose-related. In six patients, PRL levels were reduced to less than 25 ng/ml; this effect lasted at least 24 hours after intake of a single dose. In the other six patients, the response was less dramatic. No subjects developed adverse cardiovascular side effects. The results of this study demonstrate that CU 32-085 exhibits a clinically significant dopaminomimetic action on PRL secretion in hyperprolactinemic women.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Early pregnancy termination with antiprogestins: a comparative clinical study of RU 486 given in two dose regimens and Epostane.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Mifepristone, (RU 486, Roussel Uclaf, Romainville, France), a progesterone (P) receptor blocking agent, and Epostane, (WIN 32,729, Sterling-Winthrop, Guildford, United Kingdom), a P synthesis inhibitor, were compared for their ability to terminate early human pregnancy. Seventy-eight healthy women, with a gestational length of less than 49 days from the last menstrual period and who requested termination of pregnancy, were recruited to the study. The patients were randomly allocated to three treatment regimens: (1) Mifepristone 25 mg bid for 7 days; (2) Mifepristone 50 mg bid for 7 days; and (3) Epostane 200 mg qid for 7 days. The results of the study confirmed that both compounds are potent abortifacients in early human pregnancy. No difference in efficacy was seen between the two dose regimens of Mifepristone, which both resulted in 61% complete abortions. Seventy-three percent aborted completely in the Epostane group. Subjective side effects, especially nausea, were more common in the women treated with Epostane, but no serious side effects were seen.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A longitudinal study was conducted to determine the effect of combined desogestrel-ethinylestradiol treatment on lipid profiles in 28 women with polycystic ovarian disease. Mean patient age was 26.3 years (range, 16 to 36 years). Mean patient weight and height were 59.2 kg and 153.8 cm, respectively. After initial assessment, all patients were treated with a cyclical pill containing 150 micrograms desogestrel and 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol. Clinical, hormonal, and lipid determinations were evaluated after 3 and 6 cycles of treatment. The results revealed that, during the treatment course, serum luteinizing hormone, testosterone (T), free testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decreased significantly, while serum follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin levels did not change. Increased levels of total triglyceride, alpha, and prebeta lipoproteins, and decreased levels of beta lipoproteins, were observed. The ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, although showing no significant change, had a tendency to decrease. This lipoprotein change seems to have a favorable rather than an adverse effect on the patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mature and immature oocytes in large and medium follicles after clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin stimulation without human chorionic gonadotropin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- After ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate combined with human menopausal gonadotropin, 24 large (greater than 16 mm) and 16 medium (7 to 15 mm) human follicles were classified according to plasmatic estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), and histology of the follicle and oocytes (in thin sections). An asynchronism of several hours between the stage of development of the largest and large cohort follicles is observed; overripeness of oocyte cumulus complex (OCC) is revealed. An asynchronous response to gonadotropins in granulosa and cumulus is also seen in the cohort of medium follicles of the same ovary, but not resumption of nuclear maturation of the oocyte. The efficiency of these oocytes after fertilization is discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) in the treatment of oligospermic infertility.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) was used to treat 32 couples where the male partner was oligospermic (less than 12 X 10(6) motile spermatozoa per milliliter of semen). Initially, 100,000 motile spermatozoa were transferred per fallopian tube and no pregnancies were achieved in 11 cases. The technique was then modified so that a maximal number of motile spermatozoa were transferred (range, 0.11 to 0.90 X 10(6) spermatozoa) and 6 of 21 (29%) pregnancies resulted, with 325,000 spermatozoa being the lowest number associated with pregnancy. It appears that the modified GIFT technique, whereby an increased number of motile spermatozoa are replaced with the oocytes, is an effective therapy in the treatment of oligospermic infertility.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The value of oocyte reinsemination in human in vitro fertilization.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The value of oocyte reinsemination in human in vitro fertilization (IVF) was evaluated in this study. Two groups of 25 cycles each were studied. In group 1 cycles, insemination of mature/questionably mature oocytes (judged by cumulus and corona cell appearance) at 6.5 hours postcollection yielded a fertilization rate of 42.3%. This value was significantly lower than that obtained with reinsemination (70.8%). In group 2, questionably mature oocytes were treated as immature and inseminated 24 to 30 hours postcollection. The fertilization rate of mature eggs in group 2 was 68.2%, with a reinsemination success rate of 40%. Triploidy rates and cleavage rates of mature eggs, fertilized either at initial insemination or reinsemination and of fertilized immature eggs, were similar within group 1 and group 2 cycles. In group 1, two pregnancies resulted from transfer of embryos arising solely from successful reinsemination, with one infant delivered. These results indicate that reinsemination offers a useful adjunct for IVF in cases where fertilization failure occurs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of polyploidy on embryo cleavage after in vitro fertilization in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of polyploidy on the early development of human embryos is unknown. This study compares the early development of 90 polyploid and 275 diploid human embryos conceived in vitro. Between May 1983 and January 1986, 3081 oocytes were recovered during 631 cycles of laparoscopy for in vitro fertilization (4.9 oocytes/cycle); 1924 oocytes (62.4%) fertilized. There were 90 oocytes with more than two pronuclei (4.7% of fertilized oocytes), identified in 72 cycles (11.4% of cycles). In these cycles, the proportion of diploid oocytes (n = 275) that cleaved (cleavage rate) (92.7%) was significantly greater than the proportion of polyploid oocytes (n = 90) that cleaved (65.5%) (P less than 0.001). The cleavage rate for all diploid oocytes (n = 1834) was 90.4%. There was no significant difference in the stage of development (number of blastomeres; mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) on the day of embryo transfer between diploid (4.3 +/- 2.1) and polyploid (4.1 +/- 2.1) embryos that cleaved, but a plot of the frequency distribution of cleavage stages revealed that significantly more polyploid than diploid embryos had an uneven number of blastomeres at that time (33% versus 8%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Polyploidy confers an immediate developmental disadvantage; one third of polyploid embryos fail to cleave, and those that do divide demonstrate more asynchronous divisions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fertilization and cleavage rates of heparin-exposed human oocytes in vitro, and the effect of heparin on the acrosome reaction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fertilization and cleavage rates were compared in 1024 heparin-exposed and nonexposed human oocytes recovered from 183 consecutive in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Heparinized Ham's F-10 medium, (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) 1.0 ml (2.0 mg heparin/ml) was added to bloody follicular fluid; clear follicular aspirates did not receive heparin. Fertilization and cleavage rates for heparin-exposed (n = 714) and nonexposed (n = 310) oocytes were not significantly different: 63.9 versus 61.6% fertilized (chi 2 = 0.472); 89.3 versus 87.4% of fertilized eggs cleaved (chi 2 = 0.445). A subset of 100 patients, each contributing both heparin-exposed and nonexposed oocytes, also was evaluated. Fertilization and cleavage rates were not significantly different: 59.1 versus 60.8% fertilized (chi 2 = 0.192); 87.6 versus 87.2% of fertilized oocytes cleaved (chi 2 = 0.014). A modified triple stain was used to evaluate the acrosome reaction rate of sperm that had been coincubated with 76 oocytes from ten patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of viable acrosome-reacted sperm following incubation with heparin-exposed (1.9 +/- 1.0%) versus nonexposed (2.3 +/- 1.2%) (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) oocytes. The addition of heparin to follicular fluid at the time of oocyte recovery for IVF has no apparent effect on fertilization or cleavage in vitro, nor any influence on the acrosome reaction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Stress and semen quality in an in vitro fertilization program.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- While a greater understanding is emerging of the psychological stresses of infertility treatment, little is known about the specific effects of these stresses upon the quality of the semen sample used at the fertilization stage in an in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) program. This study evaluated two semen profiles for each of 500 couples on IVF treatment. The first semen sample was collected in the couple's pre-IVF workup, and the second sample was given by husbands after ovum aspiration, and used to inseminate the eggs in vitro. Comparisons of samples revealed that sperm density, total sperm count, and both quantitative and qualitative sperm motility were significantly lower in the second sample presented for IVF. For 91% of cases, there was no change across samples in assigned fertility index categories. However, 14 cases revealed a deterioration, falling from normal to pathologic, while 21 cases changed in semen character from normal in IVF workup to severely pathologic in IVF treatment. For these cases, the incidence of total fertilization failure in the procedure also dramatically increased. Several steps are discussed in the better management of patients with such declines in semen quality.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fertilization of human oocytes by microinjection of a single spermatozoon under the zona pellucida.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors report a method of micromanipulation for the insertion of a single spermatozoon under the zona pellucida of human oocytes that results in a high rate of fertilization without damage to the oocyte. Spermatozoa were exposed to calcium-depleted medium containing strontium chloride for 20 to 24 hours before resuspension in medium containing calcium to induce capacitation. Single spermatozoa treated in this way were injected under the zona pellucida of morphologically mature oocytes and fertilization was confirmed by electron-microscopy. Five of seven oocytes manipulated within 9 hours of aspiration from the follicle and 3 of 12 oocytes manipulated 23 to 28 hours after recovery from the follicle fertilized. This technique has profound implications for the possible treatment of severe male infertility.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Semen quality before and after processing by a swim-up method: relationship to outcome of intrauterine insemination.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-five couples with normal semen analyses and postcoital tests of less than or equal to 3 motile sperm/high-power field were treated by intrauterine insemination (IUI) with sperm prepared by a swim-up method. Eight women conceived (32%). Influence of semen parameters both before and after swim-up, patient age, and duration of infertility on outcome of IUI was assessed with logistic discriminant analysis. The percent motility of sperm after swim-up allowed significant differentiation of pregnant and nonpregnant patients (P = 0.0009). For patients with greater than 79% motility after swim-up, discrimination provided by post-swim-up motility (P = 0.0063) was enhanced by inclusion in the analysis of either total number of motile sperm used for insemination (P = 0.0021) or sperm concentration after swim-up (P = 0.0019), Predictions of nonpregnancy and pregnancy were correct at rates of 93.3 and 70%, respectively. There were no significant differences between semen parameters of conception and nonconception cycles of patients who conceived.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dysplasia of the fibrous sheath: an ultrastructural defect of human spermatozoa associated with sperm immotility and primary sterility.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A study of a group of five patients presenting with primary sterility and showing severe sperm immotility is presented. Most spermatozoa in these patients showed rigid, short, thick, and/or irregular tails and 95 to 100% were immotile. Electron-microscopy disclosed a common pattern of flagellar abnormalities. There was a dysplastic development of the fibrous sheath, which appeared hyperplastic and disorganized. The axoneme was either missing or grossly distorted. In a few instances, a normal flagellum could be identified. Similar alterations also were detected in maturing spermatids, suggesting that the described defect develops during spermiogenesis. Two of the five patients had recurrent bronchial and sinusal infections and bronchiectasis, suggesting the possible existence of an associated abnormality in respiratory cilia. The existence of a common ultrastructural defect affecting most spermatozoa, its presence in two brothers, and the possibility of association with immotile respiratory cilia point to the existence of a syndrome (namely the "dysplasia of the fibrous sheath") of possible familial transmission.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Results of microsurgical reconstruction in patients with combined proximal and distal tubal occlusion: double obstruction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-one patients underwent microsurgery for correction of postinflammatory occlusion of both the proximal and the distal portions of the oviduct. Preoperative staging of tubo-ovarian adhesions, hydrosalpinges, and sites of oviductal occlusion was completed in each patient. Laparoscopic records were reviewed to correlate laparoscopic sites of occlusion with those found at the time of microsurgery. The conception rate at 2.5 years of observation was 12%, and there were no live births. The sensitivity of laparoscopy to predict proximal and distal disease was 65.6 and 55.2%, respectively. The poor surgical outcome in these patients suggests that IVF-ET should be strongly considered and that a careful preoperative laparoscopic examination is necessary for prospective counseling in these patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels relate poorly with the size of a tubal pregnancy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ectopic implantation usually begins with relatively normal growth of trophoblast and serum beta-hCG progression. However, the trophoblast eventually erodes into vessels and a variable degree of bleeding and hematoma compromises its growth. The serum beta-hCG level then usually begins to demonstrate some degree of abnormal progression. For our patients, the length of the ectopic pregnancy varied widely, depending mainly on when the individual patient chose to seek medical treatment. Infertility patients followed from the moment of conception would thus be expected to show a better correlation between early beta-hCG levels and the size of the tubal pregnancy. Preconditions for the operative laparoscopic management of a tubal pregnancy usually include that the tube be unruptured, less than 3 cm in diameter, and readily accessible via the laparoscopic approach. Ackerman et al. suggested there was a general correlation between the serum beta-hCG level and tubal rupture, and the present data demonstrate an overall positive correlation between the size of the tubal pregnancy and the serum level. However, the range of levels is so broad for any given size of mass or tubal status that this correlation is not meaningful clinically. A reliable method to determine the size and status of a tubal pregnancy before laparoscopy would be valuable. Unfortunately, we did not find the preoperative serum beta-hCG level to be useful for making this prediction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of peritoneal macrophage incubates on the spermatozoa assay.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- PFM have been implicated as a possible cause of infertility in endometriosis. Previous work from our laboratory has indicated that medium incubated with PFM caused a significant decrease in sperm penetration when added to the sperm penetration assay (SPA). To further delineate this finding, medium incubated with killed macrophages, heat-inactivated medium, and various concentrations of macrophage media were added to the SPA. Analysis of the data implied that there is a 1.536% decrease in penetration for every 1% increase in the concentration of PFM medium. Heat-inactivated medium and medium incubated with dead PFM both produced penetrations statistically different from the control. We conclude that medium incubated with PFM is capable of decreasing sperm penetration as measured in the SPA in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the substance responsible for this decrease appears to be heat-stable and released from dead as well as live macrophages.</ABSTRACT>

PF from patients with mild endometriosis has an increased activity of this substance and/or additional inhibitory factors. In endometriosis, this peritoneal fluid factor or factors appear to be filterable and to a significant degree heat-labile. This observation may be of importance in explaining subfertility associated with early stages of endometriosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Blood-brain barrier choline transport is reduced in diabetic rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The kinetics of blood-brain barrier (BBB) choline transport in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats were compared with those of age-matched vehicle-injected control rats. The brain uptake index (BUI) of choline in diabetic rats (13.9 +/- 1.1%) was significantly lower than that in control rats (22.6 +/- 0.7%) (P less than .05). This alteration in brain choline uptake appeared to occur in long-standing (9 wk) diabetes. Thus, acute hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus for shorter periods (3 wk) did not significantly alter the BUI of choline. Insulin (8 U/kg) treatment for 5 days did not alter BUI in diabetic rats (12.9 +/- 0.9%). The maximal velocity of BBB choline transport (Vmax) in diabetic rats (0.14 +/- 0.07 nmol . min-1 . g-1) was significantly lower than the Vmax in control rats (2.2 +/- 0.8 nmol . min-1 . g-1) (P less than .05). The Km of choline transport in diabetic rats (120 +/- 70 microM) was modestly but not significantly lower than that in control animals (400 +/- 160 microM). Similarly, the constant of the nonsaturable component of the transport (Kd) in diabetic animals (0.5 +/- 0.07 microliter . min-1 . g-1) was not significantly different from that in control rats (0.9 +/- 0.3 microliter . min-1 . g-1). The data indicate that diabetes mellitus in rats is associated with a decreased BBB choline transport.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diminished flare response in neuropathic diabetic patients. Comparison of effects of substance P, histamine, and capsaicin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The flare response in skin largely depends on an intact primary sensory fiber, the C-fiber. We measured the flare response to the intradermal injection of substance P, histamine, and capsaicin in control subjects and in diabetic patients with and without clinically obvious polyneuropathy. The neuropathic diabetic patients had a reduced flare response to substance P, histamine, and capsaicin, compared with control and nonneuropathic diabetic subjects. The smaller flare response in the neuropathic diabetics after capsaicin administration suggested a dysfunction of the peripheral component of the C-fiber. Alternatively, dysfunction of the mast cell or vascular reactivity may contribute to the diminished flare. Because C-fibers participate in nociception in addition to the flare response, the findings of this study, by a method that permits a quantifiable measurement of the function of peripheral sensory neurons in diabetic subjects, has potential usefulness in evaluating sensory neuropathy in diabetic patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of glucose and diabetes on binding of naloxone and dihydromorphine to opiate receptors in mouse brain.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of glucose and diabetes on the high-affinity lofentanil-displaceable opiate-receptor binding in mouse brain membranes were studied to determine if the attenuation of opiate actions by hyperglycemia previously observed in our laboratory was due to a modification of receptor affinity or number. With membranes from normal ICR mice, glucose (100-400 mg/dl) caused small but significant concentration-dependent decreases in receptor affinities for [3H]naloxone and [3H]dihydromorphine, both in the absence and presence of 20 mM NaCl, without changing the maximum number of binding sites. Fructose and the nonmetabolizable sugar 3-O-methylglucose had intermediate effects on naloxone affinity in the presence of NaCl that were not significantly different from control or from the effect of glucose. Similar results were obtained with brain membranes from streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. The binding affinity for [3H]naloxone in the presence of NaCl was not affected by the induction of diabetes in ICR mice via streptozocin or in spontaneously diabetic (db/db) C57BL/KsJ mice compared with their nondiabetic (m+/m+) littermates. These results indicate that the previously observed attenuation of opiate effects by glucose may be partly due to a glucose-induced decrease in opiate-receptor affinity. However, the much greater attenuation of morphine by fructose in vivo cannot be explained by this mechanism.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dissolution of pancreatic stones by oral trimethadione in a dog experimental model.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Experiments were conducted to develop a dissolution therapy for human pancreatic calculi in a dog experimental model of pancreatic calculi surgically prepared. On plain x-ray films of the abdomen, pancreatic calculi appeared in 19 of 39 dogs within 12 mo after operation. The antiepileptic agent trimethadione was given orally to 13 dogs at a dose of 1.0-1.5 g daily. Pancreatic calculi disappeared in 13 of 15 observations. The scanning electron microscopy, the elemental analysis, and the powder x-ray diffractometry of pancreatic calculi in this model revealed that the calculi closely resembled human pancreatic calculi, consisting mainly of a calcite of calcium carbonate. There was no histologic finding suggesting drug toxicity in the liver, the kidney, and the blood. Pancreatic calculi in 6 control dogs without the treatment neither disappeared nor diminished spontaneously. The oral treatment with trimethadione may have potential for dissolving human pancreatic calculi.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Natural history of untreated colonic polyps.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The natural history of untreated colonic polyps is uncertain. A retrospective review of Mayo Clinic records from a 6-yr period just before the advent of colonoscopy identified 226 patients with colonic polyps greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter in whom periodic radiographic examination of the colon was elected over excisional therapy. In all patients, follow-up of polyps spanned at least 12 mo (mean, 68 mo; range, 12-229 mo) and included at least two barium enema examinations (mean, 5.2; range, 2-17). During the follow-up period, 83 polyps (37%) enlarged. Twenty-one invasive carcinomas were identified at the site of the index polyp at a mean follow-up of 108 mo (range, 24-225 mo). Actuarial analysis revealed that the cumulative risk of diagnosis of cancer at the polyp site at 5, 10, and 20 yr was 2.5%, 8%, and 24%, respectively. In addition, 11 invasive cancers were found at a site remote from the index polyp during the same follow-up period. These data further support the recommendation for excision of all colonic polyps greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter. Periodic examination of the entire colon is recommended in this group of patients to identify neoplasms arising at a site remote from the index polyp. Although this study has limitations inherent to any retrospective analysis, comparable prospective data are unlikely to be available in the future because of the current widespread availability of colonoscopy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tissue-specific gene expression results from a purine- and pyrimidine-free diet and 6-mercaptopurine in the rat small intestine and colon.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Dietary purines and pyrimidines are not considered to have a nutritional role, much less a direct effect on the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. We found that a dramatic decrease in adult rat small intestinal and colonic total ribonucleic acid (RNA) results from the removal of dietary purines and pyrimidines or the administration of 6-mercaptopurine. Ribonucleic acid hybridization analysis indicated specific decrease of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for the purine salvage enzymes hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase in the small intestine and proximal colon but not in the liver of animals fed a diet lacking purines and pyrimidines. Levels of intestinal and hepatic beta-actin mRNA transcripts were generally not depressed by either diet or by the administration of 6-mercaptopurine. Liver hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and adenine phosphoribosyl transferase mRNAs were unaffected by the change in diet but were lowered by the administration of 6-mercaptopurine. These data indicate that nutrition and 6-mercaptopurine affect both total RNA, and individual mRNA concentrations at specific sites in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings are of potentially great significance because the regulation of intestinal total RNA levels and purine salvage mRNAs by both 6-mercaptopurine and a purine- and pyrimidine-free diet suggests a potential mechanism by which dietary components differentially control specific proteins synthesized in the body. These findings may be related to the efficacy of 6-mercaptopurine as well as so-called elemental diets as therapeutic agents in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn's disease).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Frequency of hereditary colorectal carcinoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The frequency of hereditary colorectal carcinoma was evaluated in a study group consisting of all colorectal carcinoma patients (n = 468) diagnosed in one Finnish county (0.25 million inhabitants) during the period 1970-1979. The cancer family syndrome type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma emerged as the most common verifiable risk factor for colon cancer involving 3.8%-5.5% of all colorectal carcinoma patients in this study. The frequencies of familial adenomatosis and ulcerative colitis were 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. As the diagnostic method of this study was based on the family history of the patients, only those families with inherited cancer cases in two or more generations could be identified. The cancer family syndrome cannot be diagnosed on the basis of a single patient, and so the observed frequency of 4%-6% for the syndrome may still represent an underestimate. The patients with cancer family syndrome were young, accounting for 29%-39% of the patients under 50 yr of age, and their tumors were located predominantly (65%) in the right hemicolon. The high frequency of hereditary cases among colorectal carcinoma patients indicates the importance of studying the family history of every new patient.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antroduodenal resistance to flow in the control of duodenogastric bile reflux during fasting.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Our objectives in this study were (a) to determine the role of antroduodenal resistance in the control of fasting duodenogastric bile reflux in the dog and (b) to elucidate the contribution of the pylorus both to resistance and to reflux. Thus, we measured simultaneously throughout the interdigestive motor cycle (a) antroduodenal pressure activity by manometry, (b) antroduodenal resistance by a pneumatic resistometer, and (c) bile acid concentrations in duodenal and gastric juices. Experiments were performed in 15 conscious dogs (9 with pylorus intact and 6 with extramucosal pyloric myotomy). We found that antroduodenal resistance was lowest during phase I, increased gradually during phase II, and peaked during phase III (linear trend, p less than 0.001). Duodenogastric bile reflux was low during phase I, peaked during late phase II, and decreased again during phase III (quadratic trend, p less than 0.05). Therefore, variations in net resistance and reflux were differently related to the phases of the interdigestive motor complex. Pyloric myotomy significantly decreased antroduodenal resistance (linear trend different from control, p less than 0.001), but had no significant effect on duodenogastric bile reflux. We conclude (a) that changes in net antroduodenal resistance do not regulate duodenogastric bile reflux and (b) that the pylorus is an important determinant of antroduodenal resistance, but has no major role in the control of fasting duodenogastric bile reflux.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Local control of canine gastric mucosal blood flow.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The hemodynamic responses to venous pressure elevation and the effect of metabolic stimulation on reactive hyperemia and autoregulation were assessed in chambered segments of the canine gastric corpus perfused by a pressurized reservoir. Arteriovenous oxygen difference, mucosal pH, and total, mucosal, and muscularis blood flow were monitored continuously. Pentagastrin increased acid secretion, oxygen consumption, and both total and mucosal blood flow. Before and after pentagastrin, the magnitude of reactive hyperemia was correlated with the occlusion duration. During stepwise reductions in perfusion pressure, oxygen consumption was relatively constant and blood flow-independent over most of the pressure range. Mucosal blood flow was well maintained except at the lowest perfusion pressure. Pentagastrin did not enhance autoregulation in the mucosa or muscularis, but did enhance the autoregulation of total blood flow. A myogenic vasoconstriction occurred during 20-mmHg venous pressure elevations. Our results indicate that both metabolic and myogenic mechanisms regulate the gastric mucosal circulation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor binding is normal in rats with thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy despite elevated plasma gamma-aminobutyric acid-like activity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor density, affinity, and function, and plasma GABA-like activity were determined in rats with acute hepatic encephalopathy induced by an intraperitoneal injection of thioacetamide. In addition, the effect of various stress factors on brain GABA binding was assessed. Plasma GABA-like activity was significantly increased in rats with thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy compared with rats injected with vehicle alone (1506 +/- 993 nM, n = 7 vs. 367 +/- 97 nM, n = 9, mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001). In contrast, there were no alterations in either brain GABA receptor binding or in GABA-enhanced benzodiazepine binding in rats with hepatic encephalopathy when compared with relevant controls. However, rats that had received intraperitoneal injections of thioacetamide or vehicle (0.15 M NaCl) had significantly more low-affinity GABA receptors than rats that had neither been injected nor handled before killing (8769 +/- 1101 vs. 2710 +/- 757 fmol/mg protein, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). We concluded that stress factors appear to be important causes of altered brain GABA binding. Brain GABA receptor binding and function, however, are unaltered in rats with thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy despite elevated plasma GABA-like activity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of bile acids on hepatic protoporphyrin metabolism in perfused rat liver.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine the effect of bile acids on hepatic protoporphyrin metabolism, balance studies were performed in isolated perfused rat livers. Hepatic protoporphyrin metabolism was found to increase linearly as a function of protoporphyrin dose in livers infused with and without taurocholate (0.7 mumol/min), but their rates differed significantly. Employing a standard 1500-nmol protoporphyrin bolus dose, infusions (0.7 mumol/min) of taurocholate, glycocholate, deoxycholate, and chenodeoxycholate, but not tauroursodeoxycholate or ursodeoxycholate, increased protoporphyrin metabolism 1.7- to 2.7-fold over control (0 bile acid) values. Bile acid infusion ranging from 0.175 to 1.4 mumol/min confirmed that both taurocholate and chenodeoxycholate increased protoporphyrin disposal significantly more than ursodeoxycholate. For all bile acids, the increase of protoporphyrin metabolism was most pronounced between biliary bile acid excretion rates of 10-50 nmol/min.g liver. These data indicate that (a) bile acids facilitated protoporphyrin metabolism, (b) bile acid structure influenced the effect, and (c) ursodeoxycholate may not be a prime candidate to study the role of bile acids in the treatment of protoporphyria.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Modulation of bile secretion by hepatic low-density lipoprotein uptake and by chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in the hamster.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of both apolipoprotein B,E receptor-dependent and receptor-independent uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the liver on bile secretion were studied in bile fistula hamsters. Three groups of animals were studied after 4 wk of feeding either a control, chenodeoxycholic acid-, or ursodeoxycholic acid-containing diet. The hepatic receptor-dependent and receptor-independent uptake of LDL was related to both bile flow and biliary lipid secretion. The correlation with bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was positive for the receptor-dependent, but negative for the receptor-independent uptake of LDL. Although the receptor-mediated LDL uptake appeared to exert a strong influence on bile acid-independent bile flow, the receptor-independent uptake showed a significant relation with biliary bile acid excretion. Differences between the two mechanisms of LDL uptake were also evident in the biliary bile acid-cholesterol coupling, which was significantly stronger during receptor-independent than during receptor-dependent uptake of LDL. The effects of LDL uptake on bile secretion were modulated by the experimentally induced changes in both the content and composition of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Recurrent abdominal pain as the sole manifestation of hereditary angioedema in multiple family members.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This paper describes a previously unreported finding of abdominal pain as the only lifelong manifestation of hereditary angioedema in multiple family members. This diagnosis was obscured by the absence of cutaneous, oropharyngeal, and respiratory involvement. Barium studies performed during painful attacks showed transient intestinal wall edema which, along with abnormalities in the C4 level and C1 esterase inhibitor activity, confirmed the diagnosis. It is important that hereditary angioedema be recognized in its various forms so that invasive procedures can be avoided and prophylactic therapy can be administered.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Absence of intestinal synthesis of apolipoprotein B-48 in two cases of abetalipoproteinemia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous studies have reported that the absence of chylomicron, very-low-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein in abetalipoproteinemia is a consequence of apoprotein B (apo B) deficiency. Although the absence of apo B from the intestine has been shown by immunofluorescence, the antiserum used was raised against low-density lipoprotein apo B. Therefore, the precise nature of the underlying defect remains unknown, given that the postulated gene mutation could prevent the synthesis of the molecular form of apo B specific for chylomicrons, apo B-48, or produce an unstable aberrant form of apo B particle. This report concerns 2 girls aged 5.5 and 4.75 with well-documented clinical and biological manifestations of the disease in whom there was no immunologically detectable plasma apo B-48 and apo B-100. Their cultured jejunal explants incubated with [14C]palmitate showed slight decrease in the esterification of triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters. However, only traces of triglycerides and small amounts of cholesteryl esters were found in the culture medium in contrast to phospholipids, which were readily exported. Protein synthesis as assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation by explants was normal and only modestly diminished in the fat chylomicronlike fraction floated from the sonicated explants. However, there was no radioactivity at the electrophoretic position of apo B-100 and apo B-48. Immunologic confirmation of the absence of these two apoproteins was obtained by Western blots. These data confirm the hypothesis that in certain cases of abetalipoproteinemia the intestinal defect results from the lack of synthesis of apo B-48.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Taurocholate transport by human ileal brush border membrane vesicles.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Human ileal brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from intestines obtained from cadaveric renal allograft donors. The energetics and kinetics of taurocholate transport were studied. Fifty-five percent of equilibrium uptake (picomoles per mg protein) resulted from binding to the vesicle surface or incorporation into an osmotically insensitive compartment. The initial rate of transport was stimulated fourfold by an inwardly directed Na+ gradient when compared with a K+ gradient, and cation gradient-dependent differences persisted throughout the initial 5 min of incubation (p less than 0.05). Taurocholate uptake was half-maximally stimulated by a Na+ concentration of 23 +/- 4 mM. A Hill transformation of this plot gave a slope (n) of 0.97, indicating a 1:1 (mol/mol) Na+-taurocholate coupling ratio. Generation of a negative inside diffusion potential by anion substitution or valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential failed to alter bile salt uptake, suggesting an electroneutral transport mechanism. When Na+-dependent uptake velocity (10 s) was examined over a range of taurocholate concentration (0.036-0.9 mM), the plot described a rectangular hyperbola. The mean apparent Michaelis constant was 0.037 +/- 0.007 mM and maximum velocity was 1093 +/- 329 pmol taurocholate per milligram protein per 10 s. These data confirm and extend animal studies of ileal bile salt transport. Taurocholate uptake by the human ileal brush border occurs by a Na+-dependent, carrier-mediated electroneutral mechanism. According to this model, a single Na ion is coupled with a single taurocholate anion and transported across the brush border by a carrier mechanism that is driven by a transmembrane Na+ gradient.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Studies on the mechanism of bowel disturbance in ulcerative colitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The transit of a radiolabeled meal through the gastrointestinal tract and stool output were measured in 62 patients with ulcerative colitis, subdivided according to the activity and extent of their disease. The results were compared with those from 20 sex-matched normal subjects. Mouth-to-cecum transit was significantly slower than normal in all patient groups although gastric emptying was normal. Whole gut transit was not accelerated in any group of patients. An abdominal x-ray taken 48 h after ingesting the meal showed that patients with active colitis had proximal colonic stasis, whereas transit through the rectosigmoid region was rapid. Stool weights and frequencies were higher in patients with active colitis than in patients with quiescent disease. Patients with active colitis also passed smaller amounts of stool during each bowel movement, suggesting that they experienced a desire to defecate at lower rectal volumes. These results indicate that (a) diarrhea in ulcerative colitis is associated with rectosigmoid irritability rather than rapid transit and (b) caution should be used when treating active colitis with antidiarrheal drugs that could further retard proximal colonic transit.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Epitope-specific immune responses to rotavirus vaccination.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a leading cause of infant mortality in developing countries and an important cause of morbidity in children under 2 yr of age in the United States. Vaccine programs have evaluated animal rotavirus strains that are attenuated in humans but antigenically similar to some human strains. Whether a single vaccine strain can elicit protective immunity in humans to rotaviruses of the same or different serotypes is an important question in determining vaccine efficacy. We used characterized serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies directed at VP7 in a competitive solid-phase immunoassay to measure epitope-specific immune responses to serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in sera of children who received a candidate serotype-3 rotavirus vaccine. Antibodies to serotype 3 were detected in 72% of sera samples, and to serotype 1 and 2 in only 11% each. Also, a VP3-specific monoclonal antibody which neutralizes three serotypically distinct strains of rotavirus was used to detect the presence of similar antibodies in 56% of the test sera. This finding suggests a mechanism of heterotypic immunity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Identification of muscarinic M2 receptors on single muscle cells of the human and guinea pig intestine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Muscle cells were isolated from the longitudinal muscle layer of guinea pig and human jejunum and used to identify the muscarinic receptor subtype (M1 or M2) that mediates contraction. Single muscle cells were anchored to the ceiling of a minichamber and their contraction was measured in response to acetylcholine, alone and in combination with three muscarinic antagonists: atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), and pirenzepine. Estimates of the inhibitory dissociation constants (Ki) were closely similar in human and guinea pig muscle cells (atropine 2.5-5 X 10(-11) M, 4-DAMP 1.9-2.9 X 10(10) M, and pirenzepine 8.2-9.5 X 10(-8) M). Thus, pirenzepine, a preferential M1 antagonist, was 1900-3280 times less potent than atropine and 279-500 times less potent than 4-DAMP. Comparative measurements on longitudinal muscle strips from guinea pig jejunum confirmed the greater potency of atropine and 4-DAMP relative to pirenzepine. Inactivation of muscarinic receptors on single muscle cells with dibenamine showed that only a small fraction of receptors was responsible for the response to acetylcholine. It was concluded that intestinal muscle cells contain a large reservoir of muscarinic M2 receptors that exhibit considerable spareness and heterogeneity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gastric electromechanical and neurohormonal function in anorexia nervosa.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The gastrointestinal motor function in patients with anorexia nervosa is poorly understood, although it may be relevant to the pathophysiology of the disorder. We have undertaken a multidisciplinary study of 8 patients with anorexia nervosa and 8 age- and sex-matched controls. We have characterized their gastrointestinal and neurohormonal function by measuring (a) gastric electrical activity, (b) antral phasic pressure activity, (c) gastric emptying of solids and liquids, and (d) hormonal and autonomic function. Patients with anorexia nervosa at the time of the initiation of therapy presented with (a) increased episodes of gastric dysrhythmia (mean percentage of dysrhythmic time: 9.75 patients vs. 0.48 controls during fasting, p less than 0.02; 7.21 patients vs. 0.18 controls postcibally, p less than 0.001), (b) impaired antral contractility (mean motility index, 12.8 patients vs. 14.2 controls, p less than 0.002), (c) delayed emptying of solids, (d) decreased postcibal blood levels of norepinephrine and neurotensin (levels of beta-endorphin, insulin, glucagon, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, gastrin, cholecystokinin, and human pancreatic polypeptide were normal), and (e) impaired autonomic function (resting diastolic blood pressure and skin conductance were decreased and the response to the cold pressor test was dampened). Differences between patient and control groups were statistically significant. We conclude that patients with anorexia nervosa present multiple gastrointestinal abnormalities involving control mechanisms as well as target organs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment of vitamin E deficiency during chronic childhood cholestasis with oral d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Treatment of vitamin E deficiency during chronic childhood cholestasis is hampered by the poor intestinal absorption of available oral preparations of vitamin E when bile flow is severely impaired; thus parenteral vitamin E has been the only effective therapy for many children with this problem. We studied the intestinal absorption, efficacy, and safety of a water-soluble oral form of vitamin E, d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), in 22 children (7 mo to 19 yr old) with severe cholestasis and vitamin E deficiency who were unresponsive to massive oral doses (100-200 IU/kg.day) of dl-alpha-tocopherol. The results of oral vitamin E tolerance tests showed that TPGS was well absorbed in virtually all study subjects, that TPGS intestinal absorption was superior to that of dl-alpha-tocopherol, and that TPGS absorption in teenage children with chronic cholestasis was similar to that of normal adults. In addition, 1.7% +/- 1.6% (mean +/- SD) of the administered polyethylene glycol 1000 contained in the TPGS was absorbed and excreted in the urine of the 13 subjects analyzed, compared with 3.0% +/- 1.3% in 4 normal adults. A chronic oral dose of 15-25 IU/kg.day of TPGS corrected the biochemical vitamin E deficiency state over 1-19 mo (mean, 10.6 mo) of TPGS therapy. No clinical or biochemical evidence of gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, or hematologic toxicity was demonstrated. This study suggests that TPGS administered orally in a dose of 15-25 IU/kg.day may be a safe and effective form of vitamin E for prevention and correction of vitamin E deficiency during severe childhood cholestasis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of the biochemical changes in the jejunal mucosa of dogs with aerobic and anaerobic bacterial overgrowth.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Subcellular biochemical changes in the jejunal mucosa have been compared in dogs with either aerobic or anaerobic bacterial overgrowth to explore relationships between composition of the flora and mucosal damage. Affected animals comprised 17 German shepherd dogs with chronic diarrhea or weight loss, or both. Analysis of duodenal juice demonstrated aerobic overgrowth in 10 cases, most frequently comprising enterococci and Escherichia coli, and obligate anaerobic overgrowth in 7 cases, most frequently including Clostridia spp. Histologic changes were minimal; however, examination of peroral jejunal biopsy specimens by sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed specific biochemical abnormalities. In the dogs with aerobic overgrowth, there was a selective loss of brush border alkaline phosphatase activity, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity was increased, whereas activities of disaccharidases and aminopeptidase N were unaltered. In contrast, anaerobic overgrowth was associated with a reduction in brush border density, indicative of a considerable fall in the glycoprotein-to-lipid ratio of the brush border membrane, whereas brush border enzyme activities were unaltered. There was a loss of peroxisomal catalase activity in dogs with aerobic overgrowth, and an indication of mitochondrial disruption in dogs with anaerobic overgrowth, but little evidence for damage to other subcellular organelles. These findings demonstrate that aerobic and anaerobic overgrowth may be associated with distinct but different mucosal abnormalities particularly affecting the brush border membrane.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of vagal integrity on gastrin and somatostatin release in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Plasma gastrin and somatostatin responses to ingestion of a solid meal, to insulin hypoglycemia, and to intravenous infusion of gastrin-releasing peptide were measured in 4 conscious dogs with and without bilateral cryogenic blockade of the cervical vagus nerves. Vagal cooling to -2 degrees C abolished meal-stimulated rises in plasma gastrin and somatostatin. Atropine did not modify the gastrin response to cooling but bethanechol reduced the magnitude of inhibition to 37% +/- 9% without influencing plasma somatostatin. Gastrin-releasing peptide elevated postprandial plasma gastrin during vagal blockade to levels comparable to those with the vagus intact but did not alter the nadir plasma somatostatin response. The plasma gastrin and somatostatin rises associated with insulin hypoglycemia were similarly inhibited by cooling to -2 degrees C. Cooling to 12 degrees C, which selectively blocks vagal inhibitory pathways, had no effect on meal-stimulated gastrin release and partially decreased the plasma gastrin response to insulin hypoglycemia. Thus, gastrin release by food and by insulin hypoglycemia is mediated by a vagal nonmuscarinic excitatory pathway that is independent of changes in circulating plasma somatostatin but may include participation by the candidate neurotransmitter gastrin-releasing peptide.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The reflectance spectrophotometric technique measures an index of mucosal hemoglobin concentration and an index of oxygen saturation by spectral analysis of light reflected from the mucosal surface. Using a commercially available unit, a technique for obtaining reproducible endoscopic measurements with acceptable intraobserver and interobserver variability was developed in the anesthetized dogs. The reflectance spectrophotometric finding that experimentally induced prehepatic portal hypertension did not affect gastric mucosal blood flow was confirmed by hydrogen gas clearance measurements. Endoscopic studies in patients with active duodenal ulcer disease revealed a higher index of mucosal hemoglobin concentration and a normal index of oxygen saturation (i.e., an increase in blood flow) at the margin of the ulcer compared with the adjacent normal appearing mucosa.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A comparison of biopsy techniques in suspected focal liver disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This prospective study was designed to determine the most accurate method of obtaining a tissue diagnosis in patients with suspected focal liver disease. Computed tomography (CT) was performed initially in all patients. Patients with extensive right lobe disease on CT had a blind, percutaneous liver biopsy. Those with focal lesions on CT were randomized to either a CT or laparoscopic directed biopsy. Patients with no lesions on CT had laparoscopy for further evaluation. The results indicate that blind percutaneous biopsy is sufficient if extensive right lobe disease is present. There is no significant difference in the sensitivity of laparoscopy and CT directed biopsy if focal lesions are detected by CT. However, a negative CT directed biopsy does not exclude malignancy. Laparoscopy has a significant yield in patients with a negative CT and is the procedure of choice in evaluating these patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Perendoscopic gastric pH determination. Simple method for increasing accuracy in diagnosing chronic atrophic gastritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The endoscopic diagnosis of chronic atrophic gastritis is often underestimated, and most of the procedures adopted to increase diagnostic accuracy are time consuming and complex. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of the determination of gastric juice pH by means of litmus paper. Values obtained by this method correlate well with gastric acid secretory capacity as measured by gastric acid analysis (r = -0.64, p less than 0.001) and are not affected by the presence of bile. Gastric juice pH determination increases sensitivity and other diagnostic parameters such as performance index (Youden J test), positive predictive value, and post-test probability difference by 50%. Furthermore, the negative predictive value is very high, the probability of missing a patient with chronic atrophic gastritis with this simple method being 2% for fundic and 15% for antral atrophic change. We conclude that gastric juice pH determination, which substantially increases diagnostic accuracy and is very simple to perform, should be routinely adopted.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Atypical presentations of cardiovascular disorders in the elderly.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite the high prevalence of cardiac disease in the elderly, specific cardiac disorders are often missed or misdiagnosed in this age group. Not uncommonly, the clinical manifestations are significantly different from those in the younger patient with the same disorder. The classical findings of aortic valve stenosis may not be present and the disorder is frequently misdiagnosed as mitral valvular incompetence. Mitral valve prolapse, usually considered a benign disorder in the young and middle-aged, may present with heart failure in the elderly, and mitral valve surgery may be necessary. Instead of angina pectoris, dyspnea may be the first manifestation of coronary artery disease in the elderly. Acute myocardial infarction may be silent or present in an atypical manner with abdominal distress, acute signs of cerebral insufficiency, or dyspnea.</ABSTRACT>

The apparent lack of "anything to do" can discourage physicians from attempting anything more than perfunctory management of these cases.

<TITLE>- Palliative laser therapy for malignant dysphagia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seventy six patients with dysphagia caused by malignant tumours of the oesophagus or gastric cardia have been treated using the Neodymium Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (NdYag) laser. The laser was set to deliver 80-100 watts of power for 0.5-1 second pulses. To obtain improvement, patients on average needed four treatment sessions with a mean energy per treatment of 3586 joules. Follow up endoscopy and laser treatment was at four week intervals, unless the clinical or endoscopic results indicated otherwise. The immediate result was to allow 32% of patients to swallow anything they liked, a further 54% were able to take most solids and 9% were improved, or maintained on liquids only. The mortality of laser recanalisation and associated treatment was 5%. The improvement in swallowing was maintained until death in all but 15% of these patients, some of the 15% needed intubation to allow adequate swallowing. Endoscopic, or surgical intubation was required immediately in five patients after an initial laser course failed to provide improvement. The mean survival of the whole group was 19 weeks (range one to 112 weeks).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Endoscopic laser palliation for advanced malignant dysphagia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Palliative treatment of malignant dysphagia aims to optimise swallowing for the maximum time possible with the minimum of general distress to these seriously ill patients. Thirty four patients considered unsuitable for surgery because of advanced malignancy, other major pathology or in whom previous surgery had been unsuccessful were treated endoscopically with the Nd YAG laser. Significant improvement was achieved in 29 (85%). On a scale of 0-4 (0 = normal swallowing; 4 = dysphagia for all fluids), mean improvement was 1.7, with 25 patients (74%) able to swallow most, or all solids after treatment. With increasing experience, the average number of treatment sessions required for each patient became less; initial time in hospital became comparable to that needed for intubation. Failures were caused by inappropriate patient selection (3), or laser related perforation (2). The mean survival in the whole group was 19 weeks (range 2-44). Eighteen patients needed further treatment for recurrent dysphagia, a mean of six weeks (range 2-15) after initial therapy. Ten of these responded, but eight eventually required insertion of a prosthetic tube. The duration of good palliation was very variable after initial laser therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Proliferative instability and experimental carcinogenesis at colonic anastomoses.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The possibility that proliferative instability around a healing anastomosis promotes carcinogenesis was tested in 234 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals received the first of five weekly injections of azoxymethane (total dose 50 mg/kg) either immediately after transection of the descending colon or at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks later; controls received handling of the bowel alone. Crypt cell proliferation was assessed by autoradiography following 3HTdR injection. An overall increase in tumour yields in all transection groups was due solely to the frequent presence of anastomotic tumours. Changes in crypt morphometry and labelling index were most marked in crypt positions 1-10 away from the anastomosis. Crypts at this site increased in height at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (p less than 0.001) but returned to normal values by 12 weeks. Likewise, labelling index was increased at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (p less than 0.001) and remained higher at 12 weeks (p less than 0.05). Increased crypt cell proliferation in the immediate vicinity of an apparently 'healed' colonic anastomosis may explain its persisting susceptibility to carcinogenesis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Development of phospholipase A2 and lysophosphatidylcholine metabolising enzyme activities in the neonatal rat intestine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have studied the development of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC)-metabolising enzyme activities in the neonatal rat intestine and its relation to the intestinal permeability of macromolecules. The permeability was determined by feeding young rats a mixture of bovine serum albumin, bovine immunoglobulin G and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran 70,000, and analysing the serum concentrations after six hours. The animals were then killed and the intestinal mucosa was homogenised and assessed for PLA2 and lysoPC-metabolising enzyme activities. The intestine was 'open' to the macromolecules in 14 day old animals, but 'closed' in 22 and 32 day old animals and in 14 day old rats treated with cortisone acetate on day 10, 11, and 12 postpartum. The activity of PLA2 (at pH 6 and 2 mM Ca2+) was higher in 32, 22, and cortisone treated 14 day old animals, than in untreated, 14 day old animals. Incubation of 14C-acyl-lysoPC with mucosa from 14 day old rats did not change the radioactivity pattern as shown by thin layer chromatography, whereas after incubation with mucosa from 22 or 32 day old animals all the radiolabel was found in free 14C-fatty acid and in 14C-phosphatidylcholine. These findings indicate that mucosal PLA2 activity increases during intestinal maturation and that the mucosa acquires the ability to acylate and deacylate lysoPC when it is 'closed' to macromolecules.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Formation of a fibrin based gelatinous coat over repairing rat gastric epithelium after acute ethanol damage: interaction with adherent mucus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A gelatinous coat, heterogeneous in appearance, was formed over damaged rat gastric mucosa recovering from acute ethanol injury. This coat, in places 1.6 mm thick (median thickness 680 microns), was 10 times thicker than the translucent layer of adherent mucus (median thickness 70 microns) covering the undamaged mucosa. Immunohistochemistry and periodic acid Schiff staining showed this gelatinous coat to be predominantly a fibrin gel with an exterior layer rich in mucus and necrotic cells. The plasma clotting time was significantly decreased in vitro by pig gastric mucus gel and soluble mucus glycoprotein (90% and 13% respectively) suggesting that in vivo the mucus layer remaining after epithelial damage could act as a template for fibrinogen-fibrin conversion. These results show that a fibrin based gelatinous coat, quite distinct from the adherent mucus layer and with considerable protective potential could be formed over the repairing rat gastric mucosa after acute ethanol damage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibition of the effect of serotonin on rat ileal transport by cisapride: evidence in favour of the involvement of 5-HT2 receptors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cisapride is a synthetic drug which binds, in vitro, to type 2 serotonin receptors. We examined the influence of serotonin and cisapride on ion transport across intestinal mucosa in vitro and studied the effect of cisapride on the response to serotonin. Segments of ileum of male Sprague-Dawley rats were stripped of muscle layers and mounted in flux chambers. The addition of serotonin (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) to the serosal aspect of the mucosa caused a rapid, dose-dependent rise in short circuit current and transmural potential difference. Cisapride alone (5 X 10(-5) M), when added to the mucosal and serosal surfaces, had no effect on the short circuit current, transmural potential difference, resistance, or sodium and chloride fluxes across the mucosa. It did, however, inhibit the response of the mucosa to serotonin (10(-5) M) in a dose dependent manner and blocked it completely at a concentration of 5 X 10(-5) M. Serotonin (5 X 10(-5) M) increased serosal to mucosal flux of chloride from 12.6 +/- 0.8 to 15.2 +/- 0.6 mumol/cm2/h (p less than 0.025), thus reducing net chloride absorption from 4.65 +/- 0.81 to 1.49 +/- 1.04 mumol/cm2/h (p less than 0.05). This effect was completely blocked by cisapride (5 X 10(-5) M). In summary, cisapride inhibits the effect of serotonin on rat ileal ion transport, probably by blocking type 2 serotonin receptors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adaptation of hydrogen analysis to measure stomach to caecum transit time in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Excreted hydrogen analysis was used to measure stomach to caecum transit time of the head of a test meal in 120 rats fed by gavage. Results were compared with the distribution of a labelled test meal in the gastrointestinal tract of rats killed at different time intervals after gavage. Values for stomach to caecum transit were compatible with the distribution of labelled meals in 91% of animals, although in the remainder the hydrogen concentration had not risen even though food residues were in the caecum when the animals were killed. The technique gave reproducible results; the coefficients of variation for four studies carried out in each of six animals varied between 4 and 14%. A meal consisting of homogenised baked beans had a significantly shorter stomach to caecum transit time (88.1 +/- 4.5 min; mean +/- SE; n = 21; p less than 0.001) than an equivalent volume of Complan/lactulose (180.9 +/- 8.7 min; n = 13). This technique was used to investigate the effect of ileal infusion of a fat emulsion (20% Intralipid) via a chronically implanted intestinal cannula on the stomach to caecum transit time of a bean meal, in a series of paired studies carried out in six rats. Stomach to caecum transit time was significantly delayed during ileal infusion of 20% Intralipid compared with the control infusion of an isotonic saline solution (218.3 +/- 21 min v 106.7 +/- 33 min Intralipid v saline; n = 6; p less than 0.001).</ABSTRACT>

A non-invasive double isotope technique was used to investigate these relationships in 27 patients with a duodenal ulcer, before and after operation-truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV + P; n = 15) and highly selective vagotomy (HSV; n = 12). A further 25 patients were studied after operation (TV + P, n = 20: HSV, n = 5). 99Tcm-EHIDA was used as the biliary tracer and 113Inm bran as the gastric content tracer. In patients with a duodenal ulcer before surgery and in 16 of the 17 patients studied after HSV, the patterns of gall bladder emptying were similar to those previously found in normal subjects. In 60% of patients after TV + P, patterns of gall bladder emptying were altered and the onset of gall bladder emptying was significantly delayed (p less than 0.001) compared with unoperated patients and patients with a HSV. The rate of gall bladder emptying did not correlate with the rate of gastric emptying in any of the patients studied. These observations suggest that TV + P, but not HSV, causes considerable alteration in coordination of gall bladder and gastric emptying.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Modulation of human upper gastrointestinal motility by rectal distension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of rectal distension on upper gastrointestinal motility were investigated in six healthy subjects. On a control day, gastric and duodenal motor activity was recorded for nine hours of fasting and for four hours after a meal, duodeno-caecal transit being assessed in both interdigestive and digestive states. Motor activity and transit were also measured on a test day during which the rectum was distended for one hour during fasting and for one hour postprandially. Control and test days were randomised. During fasting, rectal distension increased the incidence of migrating motor complexes (0.8 +/- 0.3 v 0.5 +/- 0.2 h; p less than 0.01) and reduced the duodenal phase 2 motility index to 66 +/- 45% of that observed on the control day (p less than 0.01). Further, duodeno-caecal transit time was increased by rectal distension (99 +/- 30 v 71 +/- 35 min; p less than 0.05). Postprandially, the period of rectal distension was marked by a reduction in the duodenal motility index to 24 +/- 13% of that observed during the comparable period on the control day (p less than 0.001) and a concomitant increase in duodeno-caecal transit time (113 +/- 22 v 80 +/- 17 min; p less than 0.01). We conclude that upper gastrointestinal motor activity, the effector of luminal transit, may be profoundly influenced by stimulation of distal afferents.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Distribution of the 10,000 molecular weight calcium binding protein along the small and large intestine of man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The distribution of the 10,000 molecular weight calcium binding protein along the human small and large intestine was studied using an enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay. Small intestinal mucosal samples were obtained from the duodenal bulb, the second and third part of the duodenum and at about 50 cm intervals from jejunum and ileum of five whole small intestines of necro-kidney donors. Mucosal samples of caecum, colon ascendens, and transversum were also investigated. The amount of calcium binding protein per milligram of cytosolic protein increased throughout duodenum to reach the maximum in the proximal segment of jejunum and then declined steadily to nearly undetectable levels in ileum. In the colon no 10,000 molecular weight CaBP was detectable. The distribution of CaBP along the small and large intestine of man is thus parallel to the efficiency of the active calcium absorption of human intestine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Twenty four hour oesophageal acidity in achalasia before and after pneumatic dilatation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Radiotelemetric ambulatory 24 hour oesophageal pH measurement was carried out in 17 patients with symptomatic manometrically proven achalasia before and after pneumatic dilatation. Before dilatation an abnormally high percentage acid exposure time was present but typical episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred in only one patient. In nine patients who had a oesophageal food residue these values were significantly greater than those found in the remaining patients without retained food. Analysis of oesophageal food residues revealed that the low pH was predominantly caused by lactic acid. These findings indicate that preoperative oesophageal pH studies do not offer a valid means of selection of patients in whom an antireflux procedure should be combined with cardiomyotomy. Repeat studies one week after pneumatic dilatation showed a fall in the acid exposure time in patients with initial food residue presumably resulting from improved oesophageal emptying after treatment. A significant rise in acid exposure time after dilatation was seen in those patients without initial food residue presumably resulting from gastro-oesophageal reflux after therapeutic disruption of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Troublesome symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux were, however, uncommon after bag dilatation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Telenzepine is at least 25 times more potent than pirenzepine--a dose response and comparative secretory study in man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Telenzepine is an analogue of pirenzepine with a higher potency and similar selectivity for M1-receptors in animals. In this placebo controlled, double blind, randomised study mean peptone stimulated gastric acid secretion (mean +/- SEM) of 10 male healthy subjects (58 +/- 6 mmol H+/3 h for placebo) was significantly and dose dependently inhibited by oral telenzepine (2 mg: 31 +/- 5, 3 mg: 23 +/- 5, 5 mg: 21 +/- 4 mmol H+/3 h). Telenzepine 3 and 5 mg were significantly stronger than pirenzepine 50 mg orally (37 +/- 8 mmol H+/3 h). Mean percentage acid inhibition was 37% for pirenzepine, and 48, 61, and 64% for 2, 3, and 5 mg telenzepine, respectively. Basal and peptone stimulated gastrin release was unaffected. Mean salivary output per three hours declined moderately from 156 +/- 45 g (placebo) to 136 +/- 45 g with pirenzepine and significantly to 88 +/- 28 g, 95 +/- 39 g and 39 +/- 13 g with telenzepine 2, 3, and 5 mg, respectively. There was a parallel effect on Na+, K+, Ca++ and amylase output in saliva. Near point vision was not altered by either drug. Pulse rates were lowered by both substances. Complaints of dry mouth were more frequent with telenzepine 5 mg. On a molar basis telenzepine proved to be a 25 and 50 times more potent inhibitor of gastric and salivary secretion, respectively.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hepatic encephalopathy: lack of changes of gamma-aminobutyric acid content in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The aim of the study was to verify the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy occurring in cirrhotic patients by attempting to correlate plasma and cerebrospinal fluid content of authentic gamma-aminobutyric acid with the neurological manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. For this purpose, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were measured by means of mass fragmentography in 17 cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy and in 6 cirrhotics without neurological symptoms. Moreover, in all patients, a second sample was obtained during the clinical course of hepatic encephalopathy. The mean plasma and cerebrospinal fluid gamma-aminobutyric acid levels were not different in patients with or without hepatic encephalopathy and did not change during the evolution of the neurological symptoms. The lack of changes in the gamma-aminobutyric acid content in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid during hepatic encephalopathy is in contrast with the hypothesized importance of increased entry into the brain of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Uneven copper distribution in the human newborn liver.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pattern of copper distribution in human newborn liver was investigated by histochemical methods (rhodamine, orcein and rubeanic acid) and by atomic absorption spectroscopy. A significant correlation (p less than 0.005) was found between the degree of histochemical positivity and the copper concentration found by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In the majority of the 30 livers examined (first group), the copper concentration was much higher than that of normal adult liver, although exhibiting striking individual differences. No correlation between the copper content and sex, body weight or gestational age was found. From a second group of five livers, longitudinal tissue slices 0.5 cm thick were partitioned into regular blocks of about 0.5 gm, which were individually analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Copper appeared unevenly distributed within each liver, with marked differences even between adjacent blocks. However, a consistent tendency of copper to accumulate in the left lobe more than in the right one was evident. Five additional blocks, one for each liver, were further partitioned into 10 small specimens of a final size (0.05 gm), comparable to that of a needle biopsy. Even at this sampling level, consisting of tissue fragments taken from a small tissue area, the copper concentration appeared quite irregularly distributed. These findings may be considered for two different aspects: (a) the biological implications of the pattern of copper accumulation in different lobar and lobular liver compartments and (b) the statistical inference, for diagnostic purposes, of the mean liver copper content from measurements of single percutaneous biopsy specimens.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibition of human cationic glutathione S-transferase by nonsubstrate ligands.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Inhibition of a major hepatic form of human cationic glutathione S-transferase by bilirubin, biliverdin, indocyanine green and chenodeoxycholic acid was investigated as a function of pH (range = 6.5 to 9.1). Changes in pH had little effect on the extent of inhibition by indocyanine green. However, inhibition by bilirubin, biliverdin and chenodeoxycholic acid was found to be pH-dependent, with markedly less inhibition at the high values of pH. The reduced inhibition at the high values of pH could not be ascribed to a failure of the enzyme to bind the nonsubstrate ligand. Instead, the complete inhibition observed at pH 6.5 became partial (hyperbolic) inhibition at pH 9.1. This behavior can be ascribed to the binding of the nonsubstrate ligands at a site other than the active site, i.e., at high values of pH there is formation of an enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex which still retains considerable catalytic activity. At physiologic values of pH (7.0), the human transferase was completely inhibited by saturating concentrations of the tested nonsubstrate ligands. This is in contrast to our previous studies performed with the rat transferases where, although inhibition also was affected by buffer pH, some forms of the enzyme retained significant catalytic activity at pH 7.0 despite high concentrations of nonsubstrate ligands. We conclude that the ability of the human cationic glutathione S-transferases to serve as enzymes of detoxification in the presence of high intracellular concentrations of nonsubstrate ligands may be significantly reduced, and this may render the cholestatic liver unusually susceptible to injury by toxic electrophiles.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acinar redistribution and heterogeneity in transport of the organic cation rhodamine B in rat liver.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied a possible acinar heterogeneity in the transport of organic cations, using rhodamine B as model compound. Employing perfusions of isolated rat livers in the ante- and retrograde mode and quantitative fluorescence microscopy, Zones 1 and 3 were shown to be equally efficient in taking up rhodamine B. Ten minutes after injection in an antegrade perfusion, 95% of the dose was localized in the portal half of the acinus. Fifty minutes later, however, the amount of rhodamine B in Zone 1 had been reduced to 23%; 30 and 31% were in Zones 2 and 3, respectively, and the medium concentration was doubled. Thus, unchanged rhodamine B appeared to be transported downstream within the liver, either via the medium or directly from cell to cell, finally resulting in a relatively higher rhodamine B concentration in Zone 3. To obtain additional data, we designed a perfusion setup in which the zones could be studied separately. In both zones, the amount excreted into the medium was about 30 times the amount excreted into bile. Intracellular sequestration of rhodamine B and the rate constant for sinusoidal secretion were higher in Zone 3, while the sinusoidal uptake rates were equal; biliary excretion was higher in Zone 1. Acinar distribution changed with time because rhodamine B, primarily accumulated in Zone 1, was secreted into the sinusoids and taken up again by downstream cells. The finally higher rhodamine B concentration in Zone 3 was caused by a zonal heterogeneity in intracellular sequestration and sinusoidal secretion of rhodamine B.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Elevation of chemotactic factor inactivator in alcoholic liver disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Defective regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis occurs in patients with alcoholic liver disease. One potent mediator of neutrophil chemotaxis is the complement-derived neutrophil chemoattractant, C5a, which can be inhibited by a serum protein, chemotactic factor inactivator. We hypothesized that chemotactic factor inactivator elevation might, in part, explain the defective neutrophil chemotaxis seen in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. To test this hypothesis, sera were collected from 22 patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 9 normal controls, and evaluated for the antigenic presence of chemotactic factor inactivator using an ELISA test. Chemotactic factor inactivator levels were found to be markedly elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (162 +/- 24 micrograms per ml) compared to normals (60 +/- 3 micrograms per ml, p less than 0.01). Subdividing the hepatitis patients revealed that the elevation of chemotactic factor inactivator was found to be greatest in those patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis (prothrombin time within normal limits and bilirubin less than or equal to 5 mg per dl, 256 +/- 44 micrograms per ml, p less than 0.001), while the group with the severest hepatic dysfunction (prolonged prothrombin time and bilirubin greater than 5 mg per dl) did not differ significantly from controls (71 +/- 11 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.2). Importantly, the inhibition of C5a-induced chemotactic activity by partially purified chemotactic factor inactivator correlated with antigenic amounts of chemotactic factor inactivator in serum (r = 0.63, p less than 0.05). The C5a inhibitory activity in sera obtained from patients with alcoholic hepatitis coprecipitated with chemotactic factor inactivator when serum was precipitated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (45 to 64% saturation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Bile salt shift from albumin to high-density lipoprotein in cholestasis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The distribution of [3H]taurocholate between albumin and the lipoproteins of serum of patients with various diseases in which lipoprotein metabolism and/or bile salt concentrations were altered and of healthy control subjects was investigated by means of the density gradient centrifugation method. 1. In control sera, bile salts distribute mainly between albumin and high-density lipoprotein. An amount of 19.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- S.D., n = 6) of the total serum bile salts was found in the high-density lipoprotein fraction of the density gradient. 2. In sera of nonicteric patients, the distribution pattern of [3H]taurocholate in the fractions of the density gradient showed no essential differences to normal serum. The relative amounts of taurocholate in the albumin-containing fractions and the high-density lipoprotein fractions were dependent on the concentrations of albumin and high-density lipoprotein. 3. In sera of deeply jaundiced patients, the distribution pattern of [3H]taurocholate showed two distinct peaks in the high-density lipoprotein density range, one of which codistributed with high-density lipoprotein2 and the other with a high-density fraction of high-density lipoprotein3 in the density range of 1.19 to 1.23 gm per ml. The distribution of [3H]taurocholate between albumin and high-density lipoprotein was markedly shifted toward high-density lipoprotein. No [3H]taurocholate association with lipoprotein X was observed. 4. Bilirubin was found to cause a shift of taurocholate from albumin to high-density lipoprotein in vitro. It is proposed that bilirubin is responsible, at least in part, for the observed shift in icteric sera.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antibodies to polymerized human serum albumin in acute and chronic liver disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Since antibodies to polyalbumin have been noted to occur in patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis, we investigated sera from 219 patients with a variety of acute and chronic liver diseases with and without HBsAg using an ELISA. The prevalence of circulating polyalbumin antibodies was shown to be significantly increased over that of healthy controls (6.7%) in patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (67%), acute viral hepatitis (41%) and fulminant hepatic necrosis (38%), but such antibodies were absent in chronic hepatitis B patients and other liver diseases. Serial studies in acute hepatitis showed evidence of antibodies early in the course of illness with disappearance prior to full recovery. In acute hepatitis B, the presence of polyalbumin antibodies was significantly associated with female sex (p less than 0.01), 3-fold higher transaminase levels and shorter duration of clinical illness (less than 4 weeks in all cases). Polyalbumin antibodies appear to be associated with diseases characterized by active hepatocyte necrosis. Since they are evident early in acute hepatitis B when complexes of polyalbumin and virus are likely, these antibodies may play an adjunctive role to other hepatitis B-related antibodies in the clearance of hepatitis B virus infection.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The prevalence of gallstone disease (cholelithiasis and previous cholecystectomy for gallstones) in the population of the town of Sirmione, Italy, examined by ultrasonography, was 6.7% in men and 14.6% in women, ranging from 18 to 65 yr of age (overall prevalence = 11%). The prevalence of cholelithiasis in the same age span was 6.9% (4.5% in men and 8.9% in women). Prevalence of cholelithiasis increased with age in both sexes. Twenty-two percent of gallstone subjects suffered from biliary pain vs. 2% of subjects without gallstones. No difference was observed in the frequency of nonspecific symptoms between subjects with and without gallstones. Of the 132 gallstone subjects, 108 (82%) were not aware of having gallstones prior to the study. Prevalence of gallstone disease was found to be higher in obese and hypertriglyceridemic subjects and to increase with the number of pregnancies.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hepatic disease in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The spectrum of liver disease in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the clinical impact of diagnostic percutaneous liver biopsy in this population were evaluated by a retrospective review of hepatic histology, clinical features and laboratory data in 85 patients (26 biopsies, 59 autopsies). Only 1 (3.8%) biopsy and 9 (15%) postmortem livers were histologically normal. Macrosteatosis and nonspecific portal inflammation were the most common histologic abnormalities. Intrahepatic AIDS-specific opportunistic infections or malignancies were detected in 42% of both biopsy and autopsy groups, with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare the most frequent pathogen seen. Kaposi's sarcoma, although not detected on biopsy, was the most common postmortem AIDS-related hepatic finding. Intrahepatic lymphoma, cytomegalovirus hepatitis and hepatic mycoses were less frequently observed. In general, hepatic involvement represented part of a previously diagnosed, widely disseminated disease process, and liver biopsy led to new AIDS-specific diagnoses in only two patients. We conclude that while liver biopsy is a useful diagnostic tool in selected patients with AIDS, the information provided by biopsy rarely influences therapy or leads to improved survival.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Establishment and characterization of a diethylnitrosamine-initiated woodchuck hepatocyte cell line.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Woodchucks free from woodchuck hepatitis virus were treated with diethylnitrosamine in vivo for 2 months, and then hepatocytes obtained by enzymatic perfusion were cultured with the hepatopromoter phenobarbital. This in vivo-in vitro procedure gave rise to proliferating epithelial cell foci, from one of which the presently described hepatocyte cell line (WLC-3) was established and characterized. WLC-3 cells possess morphological and biochemical features of differentiated hepatocytes, including glucose-6-phosphatase activity and albumin production. Histopathological analysis of the tumor which developed transitorily in nude mouse subcutis after inoculation of the cell line revealed glandular structures comprising cells of hepatocellular-like morphology. This is the first established woodchuck hepatocyte cell line free from woodchuck hepatitis virus and is therefore expected to be useful for studying the mode of gene expression and viral proliferation of woodchuck hepatitis virus and the mechanisms underlying woodchuck hepatitis virus-related hepatocarcinogenesis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Oral calcium treatment lowers blood pressure in renovascular hypertensive rats by suppressing the renin-angiotensin system.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of calcium supplementation on blood pressure and its mechanisms were investigated in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats. Two series of experiments were performed: one was begun just after renal artery constriction, the other after the onset of hypertension. Calcium supplementation significantly attenuated the development of hypertension (systolic blood pressure: 183 +/- 8 vs 130 +/- 2 mm Hg) and was found to abate existing renovascular hypertension (systolic blood pressure: from 183 +/- 8 to 151 +/- 4 mm Hg). Calcium treatment did not cause significant alterations in fluid intake, urine volume, or urinary sodium excretion in either study. However, increased plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were suppressed to the basal levels at the end of 3 weeks of calcium treatment (14 +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 2 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr; 530 +/- 50 vs 380 +/- 40 pg/ml). Blood pressure of calcium-treated renovascular hypertensive rats responded poorly to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril injection and angiotensin II analogue (saralasin) infusion. Further, in rats with chronic established renovascular hypertension, calcium treatment attenuated the enhanced pressor response to norepinephrine, but not to angiotensin II. These results suggest that the blood pressure-lowering actions of calcium supplementation are related primarily to suppression of renin secretion and secondarily to alteration of pressor response to norepinephrine in two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertensive rats.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Assessment of the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier in hypertensive rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We assessed the permeability surface area products at the blood-retinal barrier and blood-brain barrier to sucrose (molecular weight, 340) and microperoxidase (molecular weight, 2000) following acute hypertension induced by metaraminol in Wistar-Kyoto rats (controls) and during chronic hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In acute hypertension, the permeability surface area product for sucrose was increased at the blood-retinal barrier and at the blood-brain barrier over control values (p less than 0.02), and the vessels became leaky to microperoxidase. In chronic hypertension, the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier to sucrose was increased over that in control animals (p less than 0.02), whereas the permeability of the blood-brain barrier was unaffected. Neither barrier leaked microperoxidase. These results indicate that the blood-brain barrier and the blood-retinal barrier are similarly affected in acute hypertension and that in chronic hypertension, the blood-brain barrier is unaffected whereas the blood-retinal barrier is rendered more permeable to small, but not large, solutes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Improved myocardial efficiency in the working perfused heart of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We assessed the relationship between determinants of myocardial oxygen demand--wall stress, peak rate of change of pressure and heart rate--and measured myocardial oxygen consumption over a range of loading conditions in the perfused, working heart of 6-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Two isolated heart preparations, an aortic-ejecting heart and an isovolumically contracting preparation with and without isoproterenol (10(-7)M) added, were employed. Under a constant perfusion pressure of 110 mm Hg, the heart rate, developed wall stress, and peak rate of change of pressure were not different between the two groups, but coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were significantly lower in the SHR. Systolic values of myocardial high energy phosphate compounds (adenosine 5'-triphosphate, phosphocreatine) and myocardial lactate in the two preparations were not significantly different between SHR and WKY. Following adenosine infusion at maximum developed pressure (isovolumic preparation), both SHR and WKY demonstrated preservation of coronary reserve. These results indicate that cardiac hypertrophy represents a compensatory adaptation with improved mechanical efficiency in the 6-month-old SHR when maximally stressed and may be related to the shift from V1 to V2 and V3 isomyosin phenotypes that was observed in the hypertensive animals.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibition of muscle sympathetic nerve activity in humans by arginine vasopressin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Arginine vasopressin, a potent vasoconstrictor, does not raise arterial pressure in normal humans even at pathophysiological plasma levels. To examine whether the pressor effect of vasopressin in humans is buffered by baroreceptor reflex inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity, we recorded postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity directly from the peroneal nerve in 12 normal men before, during, and after a 20-minute intravenous infusion of vasopressin, 4 ng/kg/min, that increased mean plasma concentrations from 6.2 +/- 0.6 to 320 +/- 68 (SE) pg/ml. During the first 5 minutes (n = 8), mean arterial pressure increased from 91 +/- 3 to 97 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and integrated sympathetic nerve activity decreased from 271 +/- 45 to 156 +/- 33 units (p less than 0.05). At 15 minutes (n = 12), arterial pressure did not differ from control values whereas forearm vascular resistance fell (p less than 0.05) and central venous pressure and heart rate increased (p less than 0.05). Sympathetic nerve activity remained below control levels throughout the infusion (202 +/- 31 vs 254 +/- 40 units before infusion; p less than 0.05). An effect of vasopressin on ganglionic transmission was excluded, since the sympathoexcitatory response to apnea was not attenuated during vasopressin. Thus, pathophysiologic levels of vasopressin in humans cause inhibition of muscle sympathetic nerve activity that is not due to a ganglionic blocking action. The sympathoinhibition may be caused in part by the modest increases in mean arterial and central venous pressures and attendant stimulation of arterial and cardiac baroreceptors. The reflex decrease in sympathetic nerve activity would be expected to buffer the direct vasoconstrictor effects of vasopressin.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Do hypertensive patients have a different diurnal pattern of electrolyte excretion?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Studies generally indicate that excretion of sodium, potassium, and water is greater during the day than during the night. To determine whether hypertensive patients exhibit this same pattern of excretion, diurnal variations in excretion of sodium, potassium, creatinine, and water were examined in 107 hypertensive men and women from a clinical trial on control of hypertension by nonpharmacological means--the Hypertension Control Program. Each participant provided two carefully timed 24-hour urine collections divided into daytime and overnight specimens. The median ratios of 24-hour to 8-hour overnight excretion were 2.84, 3.95, 2.99, and 2.77 for sodium, potassium, creatinine, and water, respectively. Thus, more than half of this hypertensive group exhibited a greater rate of sodium and water excretion during sleep than during daytime hours, a reversal of the usual pattern. When the group was subdivided based on age, sex, race, trial randomization group, use of diuretics, and hypertension severity, women had significantly lower ratios of 24-hour to overnight excretion for sodium and water than men and blacks had significantly lower 24-hour to overnight ratios for water and potassium than whites. When the 24-hour to overnight ratios for these hypertensive patients were compared with those for a group of 30 men and women with high-normal blood pressure, those with high-normal blood pressure had significantly larger ratios for sodium and water excretion than the hypertensive group. The results of this study suggest that hypertensive patients may have a different diurnal pattern of sodium and water excretion than normotensive subjects and that further research is needed to clarify this issue.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Consequences of worksite hypertension screening. Changes in absenteeism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To confirm reports of increased absenteeism after worksite hypertension screening, we performed a three-stage blood pressure screening among 5888 self-selected heterogeneous workers at 11 electronics plants using standardized screening and labeling procedures. A total of 296 subjects with mean systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater on all three occasions were considered to have sustained hypertension. From the untreated normotensive subjects matched for eight sociodemographic and occupational variables, we prospectively selected one to three controls for each sustained hypertensive subject. Uncorrected absenteeism rates for sustained hypertensive subjects increased 22% from baseline in the postscreening year. Correction by logarithmic transformation for skewed distributions and by rates for matched controls for temporal trends reduced these changes to statistical insignificance with high statistical power. Several subgroups exhibited trends to increased absenteeism. At 12-month follow-up, the blood pressure of the sustained hypertensive subjects showed mean decreases of 12.6/6.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) after the majority had received pharmacological antihypertensive treatment. These results suggest that worksite hypertension screening and labeling produce insignificant absenteeism change overall among self-selected heterogeneous work force populations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Blood pressure response to potassium supplementation in normotensive adults and children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To investigate the effect on blood pressure of a modest increase in dietary potassium intake, 38 healthy, free-living families were enrolled in a study involving 4 weeks of potassium supplementation. This was preceded by collection of five baseline measurements of blood pressure and urinary electrolyte excretion and followed by a 4-week recovery period. Although there was a significant increase in urinary potassium excretion during supplementation in both adults and children (p less than 0.001), there were no significant changes in systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial blood pressure. Height and weight increased significantly in children (p less than 0.001), and weight increased in adults (p less than 0.01) over the course of the study. Multivariate analysis of variance of blood pressure controlling for these confounding variables failed to reveal any effect of the potassium supplementation on blood pressure. These results suggest that increasing intake of dietary potassium alone in a healthy, free-living normotensive population is unlikely to have a discernible effect on blood pressure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Association of haptoglobin with sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure were examined in 117 normotensive and 85 hypertensive subjects by means of a protocol using rapid extracellular fluid volume expansion with intravenously administered saline (2 L over 4 hours) followed by a day of low dietary sodium intake (10 mEq) and volume contraction induced by a diuretic (furosemide, 120 mg orally). Genetic markers were also examined. Both hypertensive and normotensive subjects with haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype were significantly more (p less than 0.05) likely to be sodium-sensitive than were those with 2-1 or 2-2 phenotypes, and subjects with 2-2 phenotypes were more apt to be sodium-resistant. A second population was examined in which both adults and children with haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype were found to have significantly (p less than 0.05) higher casual systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These two studies independently confirm a relationship between haptoglobin phenotypes and blood pressure and suggest an environmental factor (sodium) as well.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pregnancy hypertension, blood pressure during labor, and blood lead levels.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pregnancy hypertension, blood pressure during labor, and the umbilical cord blood lead concentration were assessed in 3851 women for whom additional demographic, medical, and personal information was available. Lead levels correlated with both systolic (Pearson r = 0.081, p = 0.0001) and diastolic (r = 0.051, p = 0.002) blood pressures during labor. The incidence of pregnancy hypertension increased with lead level. Multivariate models of pregnancy hypertension and systolic blood pressure as a function of maternal age, parity, hematocrit, ponderal index, race, and diabetes were improved by including lead as a predictor variable. At these observed levels of exposure (mean blood lead, 6.9 +/- 3.3 [SD] micrograms/dl), lead appears to have a small but demonstrable association with pregnancy hypertension and blood pressure at the time of delivery, but not with preeclampsia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Endocrine and psychologic responses of patients to cardiac pacemaker implantation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The findings that all HPA and SAM indexes increased during the first postoperative days strongly suggest that transvenous, permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation is a stressor. Since the psychologic tests did not demonstrate marked changes in anxiety or affective mood states, and the former was only weakly related to the endocrine responses, psychologic stimuli cannot be ascribed a prominent role in causing the observed endocrine alterations. Thus, the data suggest that physiologic stressors, such as surgical trauma and the irritation of the tissue surrounding the pacemaker, were the primary stimuli that activated the HPA and SAM systems. Although the structured teaching program resulted in a marked improvement of the treatment groups's knowledge of the device and the follow-up care it requires, it did not affect the endocrine or psychologic responses of patients to cardiac pacemaker implantation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Protein synthesis in hyperoxic endothelial cells: evidence for translational defect.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To study the effects of hyperoxia on protein synthesis in primary cultures of porcine aortic endothelial cells, we exposed confluent cells to different O2 concentrations for various durations. Exposure to 95% O2 for 5 days resulted in a 71% inhibition of [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into total proteins. When compared with control cells, we observed no changes in 1) the pool size of free cytoplasmic phenylalanine and of phenylalanine attached to transfer RNA (tRNA), 2) the rate of protein degradation, and 3) the rate of charging of tRNA with phenylalanine. We found that under hyperoxic conditions 1) the incorporation of [3H]-uridine into total and polyadenylated RNA was increased, 2) the efficiency of extracted messenger RNA to direct protein synthesis in a reticulocyte lysate was maintained, 3) the proportion of polymeric to monomeric ribosomes was slightly increased, and 4) the rate of elongation, as measured by the ribosomal transit time, was decreased. Thus the reduction in protein synthesis in hyperoxic cells appears to result primarily from defects at the translational level in polypeptide chain elongation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- In vivo contractile properties of fatigued diaphragm.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of fatigue on diaphragmatic contractility in vivo are unknown. In this study we used sonomicrometry to examine the velocity of shortening and lengthening and the amount of shortening in the fresh and fatigued canine hemidiaphragm (8 dogs) including the force generated. Fatigue was produced by epiphrenic stimulation of the left phrenic nerve; the right hemidiaphragm acted as the control. We found that 1) hemidiaphragmatic fatigue caused an increase in frequency with reduced tidal volume; 2) fatigue resulted in a near complete cessation of tidal shortening during spontaneous breathing; 3) there was an initial decrease in central activation (electromyogram) to the fatigued hemidiaphragm, an indication of central fatigue; 4) force-frequency curves showed a considerable and prolonged loss of the amount of shortening, velocity, and force generated by the fatigued hemidiaphragm during supramaximal stimulation, an indication of peripheral fatigue; and 5) during spontaneous breathing in the fatigued hemidiaphragm, tidal shortening remained reduced for up to 3 h, whereas in the right right hemidiaphragm tidal shortening and electromyographic activity did not change. We conclude that fatigue of a hemidiaphragm alters the spontaneous breathing pattern and produces profound modifications in its contractile properties without altering contralateral hemidiaphragmatic performance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Upstream pressure for systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation, important in perfusing potentially ischemic regions distal to pulmonary vascular obstructions, depends on driving pressure between an upstream site in intrathoracic systemic arterial network and pulmonary vascular bed. The reported increase of pulmonary infarctions in heart failure may be due to a reduction of this driving pressure. We measured upstream element for driving pressure for systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation by raising pulmonary venous pressure (Ppv) until the systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation ceased. We assumed that this was the same as upstream pressure when there was flow. Systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation was measured in left lower lobes (LLL) of 21 anesthetized open-chest dogs from volume of blood that overflowed from pump-perfused (90-110 ml/min) pulmonary vascular circuit of LLL and was corrected by any changes of LLL fluid volume (wt). Systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation upstream pressure was linearly related to systemic arterial pressure (slope = 0.24, R = 0.845). Increasing Ppv caused a progressive reduction of systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation, which stopped when Ppv was 44 +/- 6 cmH2O and pulmonary arterial pressure was 46 +/- 7 cmH2O. A further increase in Ppv reversed systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation with blood flowing back into the dog. When net systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation by the overflow and weight change technique was zero a small bidirectional flow (3.7 +/- 2.9 ml.min-1 X 100 g dry lobe wt-1) was detected by dispersion of tagged red blood cells that had been injected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of estradiol on tissue glycogen metabolism in exercised oophorectomized rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of both physiological and pharmacological doses of estradiol on exercise performance and tissue glycogen utilization was determined in oophorectomized estradiol-replaced (ER) rats. Doses of beta-estradiol 3-benzoate (0.02, 0.04, 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, 4, or 10 micrograms.0.1 ml of sunflower oil-1.100 g body wt-1) were injected 5 days/wk for 4 wk. Controls were sham injected (SI). After treatment, the animals were run to exhaustion on a motorized treadmill. ER animals receiving the 0.02-microgram dose ran significantly longer and completed more total work than the SI group. ER animals receiving doses of greater than or equal to 0.04 microgram ran longer and performed more work than the 0.02-microgram group. At exhaustion, myocardial glycogen content was significantly decreased in animals that were ER with less than or equal to 0.1 microgram, whereas those replaced with doses greater than 0.1 microgram utilized significantly less glycogen. With the 10-micrograms dose no significant decrease in heart glycogen content was observed at exhaustion. A submaximal 2-h run significantly reduced glycogen content in heart, red and white portions of the vastus lateralis, and the livers of SI animals. The latter effect was attenuated in skeletal muscle and liver, and there was no effect in the hearts of the ER animals receiving 2 micrograms. These data indicate that estradiol replacement in oophorectomized rats influenced myocardial glycogen utilization during exhaustive exercise and spared tissue glycogen during submaximal exercise. These glycogen sparing effects may have contributed to the significant improvements in exercise performance observed in this study.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Interaction of contractile responses in canine tracheal smooth muscle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Concentration-response curves for norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine were obtained in vitro alone and after precontraction with histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or acetylcholine. Responses obtained to each agonist after precontraction were greater than responses to the agonist alone after subtraction of the force due to the precontracting stimulus. Augmentation of responses after precontraction was the greatest for norepinephrine, less for 5-hydroxytryptamine, and least for acetylcholine. Verapamil had no significant effect on the augmentation of responses to either 5-hydroxytryptamine or acetylcholine caused by precontraction. When the efficacy of acetylcholine was decreased by receptor alkylation with phenoxybenzamine, the augmentation of responses to acetylcholine caused by precontraction with histamine was significantly enhanced. Differences in the magnitude of the effect of precontraction on responses to different agonists may reflect differences in their efficiency of stimulus-response coupling in canine tracheal smooth muscle, or they may result from an increased expression of distinct receptors or receptor-mediated effects uncovered by the facilitory stimuli.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Operation Everest II: elevated high-altitude pulmonary resistance unresponsive to oxygen.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- High altitude increases pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), but no measurements have been made in humans above 4,500 m. Eight male athletic volunteers were decompressed in a hypobaric chamber for 40 days to a barometric pressure (PB) of 240 Torr, equivalent to the summit of Mt. Everest. Serial hemodynamic measurements were made at PB 760 (sea level), 347 (6,100 m), and 282/240 Torr (7,620/8,840 m). Resting PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from sea level to maximal values at PB 282 Torr from 15 +/- 0.9 to 34 +/- 3.0 mmHg and from 1.2 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 mmHg.l-1 X min, respectively. During near maximal exercise PAP increased from 33 +/- 1 mmHg at sea level to 54 +/- 2 mmHg at PB 282 Torr. Right atrial and wedge pressures were not increased with altitude. Acute 100% O2 breathing lowered cardiac output and PAP but not PVR. Systemic arterial pressure and resistance did not rise with altitude but did increase with O2 breathing, indicating systemic control differed from the lung circulation. We concluded that severe chronic hypoxia caused elevated pulmonary resistance not accompanied by right heart failure nor immediately reversed by O2 breathing.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Operation Everest II: preservation of cardiac function at extreme altitude.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hypoxia at high altitude could depress cardiac function and decrease exercise capacity. If so, impaired cardiac function should occur with the extreme, chronic hypoxemia of the 40-day simulated climb of Mt. Everest (8,840 m, barometric pressure of 240 Torr, inspiratory O2 pressure of 43 Torr). In the five of eight subjects having resting and exercise measurements at the barometric pressures of 760 Torr (sea level), 347 Torr (6,100 m), 282 Torr (7,620 m), and 240 Torr, heart rate for a given O2 uptake was higher with more severe hypoxia. Slight (6 beats/min) slowing of the heart rate occurred only during exercise at the lowest barometric pressure when arterial blood O2 saturations were less than 50%. O2 breathing reversed hypoxemia but never increased heart rate, suggesting that hypoxic depression of rate, if present, was slight. For a given O2 uptake, cardiac output was maintained. The decrease in stroke volume appeared to reflect decreased ventricular filling (i.e., decreased right atrial and wedge pressures). O2 breathing did not increase stroke volume for a given filling pressure. We concluded that extreme, chronic hypoxemia caused little or no impairment of cardiac rate and pump functions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of halothane on control of breathing in intact and decerebrated cats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of halothane anesthesia have been investigated in intact and in decerebrated cats. Pulmonary ventilation and breathing pattern were studied during room-air breathing, hypercapnia, and O2 inhalation. The following results have been demonstrated. First, halothane anesthesia does not modify pulmonary ventilation, but a tachypnea much more intense in intact than in decerebrated cats is observed. This indicates that halothane-induced tachypnea originates mainly in structures rostral to the brain stem. Second, decerebrated animals exhibit a breathing pattern and a ventilatory response to CO2 similar to those of intact conscious cats, suggesting that forebrain facilitatory and inhibitory influences on brain stem are cancelled out by decerebration. However, the tidal volume vs. inspiratory duration relationship observed in decerebrated cats differs from that in conscious cats. Finally, during halothane anesthesia, ventilatory response to CO2 is markedly depressed. Third, during O2 inhalation, except in decerebrated, anesthetized animals, ventilation is only slightly depressed. This suggests that central stimulatory effect of O2 is enhanced and/or that peripheral chemoreceptor drive is reduced.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of autonomic blockade on cardiac function at rest and during upright exercise in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The cardiac function was studied by radionuclide cardiography in eight healthy subjects at rest and during submaximal upright exercise before and after autonomic blockade with metoprolol and atropine. At rest the median stroke volume was reduced by 21% during autonomic blockade (P less than 0.01), but cardiac output was maintained by a concomitant increase in heart rate. The systolic blood pressure was reduced from 120 to 105 mmHg (P less than 0.01), and left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced from 61 to 56% (P less than 0.05). After autonomic blockade the heart rate reached during exercise was the same. Stroke volume and cardiac output were maintained through cardiac dilation. The increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume was 31 vs. 10% during control conditions (P less than 0.01). The systolic blood pressure was reduced from 174 to 135 mmHg (P less than 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced from 75 to 67% (P less than 0.05), but the increase from rest to exercise was preserved. Total peripheral resistance was reduced by 17% (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that the heart possesses intrinsic mechanisms to maintain cardiac output during submaximal upright exercise. End-diastolic dilation results in a preserved stroke volume despite a reduced contractility.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Structural and functional responses to prolonged hindlimb suspension in rat muscle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to investigate alterations in structural and functional properties in the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of rats after 1, 2, and 5 wk of tail suspension. Maximal O2 uptake was 19% lower after 5 wk suspension. Loss of muscle mass was greater in SOL (63%) than in EDL (22%) muscle. A reduction of type I distribution was accompanied by an increase of intermediate fiber subgroups (int I in SOL, int II in EDL). The cross-sectional area of all three fiber types was reduced by hypokinesia. The decrease in capillaries per fiber in SOL was greater than the decrease in citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities after 5 wk. No alteration in lactate dehydrogenase activity was noted. In EDL, no changes in fiber area, capillarization, and enzymatic activities occurred. Energy charge remained unchanged (0.91) whatever the muscle. These results suggest that type I fibers showed an earlier and greater susceptibility than type II fibers to suspension which is also accompanied by a decreased aerobic capacity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Human skeletal muscle function and metabolism during intense exercise at high O2 and N2 pressures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The maximal contractile force (peak torque) of the quadriceps femoris was studied during 60 repeated unilateral dynamic knee extensions in nine subjects under three different conditions, viz., during air breathing at normal (1 ATA) and raised (6 ATA) ambient pressures and during O2 breathing at 1.3 ATA. In six subjects the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the working muscle was recorded. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis before, immediately after, and 1 min after exercise. Tissue specimens were subsequently assayed for various muscle metabolites. Peak torque, as an average of the 60 knee extensions, was higher (P less than 0.05) at 1.3 ATA than at 6 or 1 ATA. Peak torque of the exercising muscle declined more rapidly at 1 ATA than at 1.3 ATA, differing in the final 24 contractions by 14%. At 6 ATA peak torque of the initial 12 contractions was 6% lower (P less than 0.05) than at 1 ATA but equaled 1-ATA values in the latter third of the exercise bout. Although the EMG activity at 1 ATA increased relative to that at 6 ATA as exercise proceeded, the rate of force decline was greater at 1 ATA. Despite greater total work produced at 1.3 ATA than at 1 ATA, the metabolic response to exercise was not substantially altered at increased O2 pressure. However, the restitution rate of energy-rich phosphagens and the elimination of lactate during recovery were greater (P less than 0.05) at 1.3 ATA. These results suggest that hyperoxia may enhance the rate of energy release, whereas high N2 pressure and/or high hydrostatic pressure seem to interfere with neuromuscular activity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physiological responses of aged men to head-up tilt during heat exposure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of age on cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses to passive tilting were investigated using six old (61-73 yr) and 10 young (21-39 yr) unacclimatized men. Experiments were carried out at 26 degrees C and after exposure to 40 degrees C and 40% relative humidity for 105 min. Continuous measurements of esophageal (Tes) and mean skin (Tsk) temperatures and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Other variables studied included blood pressure (BP), forearm blood flow (FBF), and cardiac output (CO), which were measured at 4- to 5-min intervals. Measurements were made in the supine position and after 70 degrees head-up tilt for 15 min. Cardioacceleration during the tilt test was greater in the young men than in the old. Other cardiovascular responses of the old men to orthostatism were qualitatively similar to that of the young except for FBF and forearm vascular conductance. The old men did not show significant changes in FBF during tilting, suggesting a deterioration in the sympathetic nervous reflex in the aged. However, other circulatory adaptations seemed to overcome this deficiency resulting in orthostatic tolerance similar to that of the young. During head-up tilt at 26 and 40 degrees C, Tes of both age groups increased. This may reflect a decrease in conductive heat transfer presumably due to diminished blood flow to the periphery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparative effects of leukotrienes on porcine pulmonary circulation in vitro and in vivo.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The present study examined the effect of leukotrienes on porcine pulmonary vasculature both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro studies using isolated vascular strips demonstrated that pulmonary arterial smooth muscle contracted to leukotriene C4 (LTC4), whereas pulmonary vein smooth muscle did not. Pulmonary arterial contraction was due to both the direct action of LTC4 and secondarily generated thromboxane A2 (TxA2). In vivo, LTC4 injection caused a pronounced but transient increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (Ppw), with a smaller effect on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Effects of LTD4 were smaller with comparable pressure changes at all three sites, suggesting a primary cardiac effect. Like LTC4, histamine caused a disproportionate increase in Ppw vs. left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These observations suggest that LTC4 causes pulmonary venoconstriction in vivo despite its lack of effect on pulmonary vein smooth muscle in vitro. This discrepancy may be due to venoconstrictor effects of TxA2 generated from upstream pulmonary arterial vessels.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of theophylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor-adenosine receptor antagonist) and substrate feeding (Ensure, 250 kcal/235 ml) on cold resistance were studied in seminude males undertaking submaximal (50% maximum O2 consumption), intermittent (34% of total time) exercise in the cold (-5 to 15 degrees C, individually adjusted) for 3 h. Each subject (n = 7) served as his own control and was tested on a weekly schedule. Under control treatment, rectal temperature (Tre) decreased by 0.9 degrees C to approximately 36.2 degrees C after cold exposure, whereas under theophylline and Ensure, the decrease of Tre was only 0.4 degrees C, indicating a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in cold resistance (50% better than control). The plasma concentration of theophylline was 4.8-5.9 micrograms/ml and was positively correlated with plasma concentration of free fatty acids. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) increased significantly during cold exposure; the absolute concentration was significantly higher after theophylline pretreatment. The plasma concentrations of glucose, epinephrine, cortisol, and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate did not change and the changes of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were minor. Together, the effectiveness of theophylline + Ensure in acutely increasing cold resistance may be due to increased substrate availability for thermogenesis, part of which, through theophylline's potentiation of both sympathetic release of NE and NE-stimulated lipolysis and part of which, through supplementary feeding of Ensure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Species variation in lung antioxidant enzyme activities.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Exposure of several different animal models to O2-induced lung injury has revealed marked differences in sensitivity of various species to O2 damage. These differences may be due in part to variation of cellular antioxidant defenses. To characterize lung antioxidant enzyme activities in different species, we measured lung activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GSH S-trans) in rat, hamster, baboon, and human lung. Soluble lung fractions were also fractionated on Sephadex G-150-S columns and GSH-Px activity was measured using both cumene hydroperoxide and H2O2. This was done to evaluate non-Se-dependent GSH-Px activity in these lung samples. Human lung was obtained at surgery from patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy for localized lung tumors. SOD activity was similar for all four groups. GSH-Px activity was higher in rat lung than baboon or hamster lung. Lung CAT activity was variable with the highest activity present in the baboon which revealed a lung CAT activity 10 times higher than activity present in the rat. Lung GSH S-trans activities were higher in hamster, baboon, and human lung than in rat lung. Non-Se-dependent GSH-Px was present in rat lung but absent in hamster, baboon, and human lung. We conclude that the hamster was the best model of the animals studied for mimicking human lung antioxidant enzyme activities. Rat lung antioxidant enzyme activities were markedly different from any of the other species examined.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Neuromuscular and mechanical responses to inspiratory resistive loading during sleep.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purposes of this study were 1) to characterize the immediate inspiratory muscle and ventilation responses to inspiratory resistive loading during sleep in humans and 2) to determine whether upper airway caliber was compromised in the presence of a resistive load. Ventilation variables, chest wall, and upper airway inspiratory muscle electromyograms (EMG), and upper airway resistance were measured for two breaths immediately preceding and immediately following six applications of an inspiratory resistive load of 15 cmH2O.l-1 X s during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep. During wakefulness, chest wall inspiratory peak EMG activity increased 40 +/- 15% (SE), and inspiratory time increased 20 +/- 5%. Therefore, the rate of rise of chest wall EMG increased 14 +/- 10.9% (NS). Upper airway inspiratory muscle activity changed in an inconsistent fashion with application of the load. Tidal volume decreased 16 +/- 6%, and upper airway resistance increased 141 +/- 23% above pre-load levels. During sleep, there was no significant chest wall or upper airway inspiratory muscle or timing responses to loading. Tidal volume decreased 40 +/- 7% and upper airway resistance increased 188 +/- 52%, changes greater than those observed during wakefulness. We conclude that 1) the immediate inspiratory muscle and timing responses observed during inspiratory resistive loading in wakefulness were absent during sleep, 2) there was inadequate activation of upper airway inspiratory muscle activity to compensate for the increased upper airway inspiratory subatmospheric pressure present during loading, and 3) the alteration in upper airway mechanics during resistive loading was greater during sleep than wakefulness.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Maturation of spontaneous fetal diaphragmatic activity and fetal response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The electromyogram (EMG) of the diaphragm, lateral rectus, and nuchal and hindlimb muscles were studied during spontaneous activity and during hypercapnia or hypoxemia in eight fetal sheep from 0.5 to 0.8 gestation (73-128 days). At the earliest gestational age, diaphragmatic EMG activity was mainly tonic and associated with tonic activity of somatic muscles. The stimulus for the diaphragmatic activity originated centrally. Brief periods of a rapid-eye-movement (REM) state characterized by phasic lateral rectus and diaphragmatic activity and absence of nuchal activity were recognized. Furthermore, from 0.5 to 0.7 gestation onward, activity of all muscles increased. Thereafter increased specificity of activity in relation to the apparent REM and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) state occurred. With maturation, phasic diaphragmatic activity increased at the expense of tonic activity. The most striking effect of maturation on apnea was a greater proportion of apnea lasting greater than 1 min, but the total duration of apnea as a percent of a total recording remained unchanged. The quantitative response to hypercapnia during maturation was independent of the pattern of spontaneous diaphragmatic activity. Hypercapnia at 0.5 gestation changed the pattern of diaphragmatic EMG activity from mainly tonic to phasic. Thus the central chemoreceptors and appropriate neuronal pathways are present and functional as early as 0.5 gestation. Hypercapnia at 0.5 gestation caused a shift in diaphragmatic EMG power to lower frequencies similar to that found during control conditions in the older fetus. This might suggest that during maturation there is increased recruitment of phrenic motoneurons. Hypoxemia abolished tonic somatic activity at 0.5 gestation and decreased phasic diaphragmatic activity at more advanced gestational ages. Therefore the central inhibitory mechanisms of hypoxemia are developed by 0.5 gestation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Plasma fibronectin therapy and lung protein clearance with bacteremia after surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Plasma fibronectin modulates macrophage phagocytic function and can also incorporate into the insoluble tissue pool of fibronectin where it influences endothelial cell adhesion and tissue integrity. We studied the effect of postoperative bacteremia on lung protein clearance in relation to plasma fibronectin levels using the unanesthetized sheep lung lymph fistula model and the effect of infusion of purified human plasma fibronectin on lung protein clearance. Sheep received live Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 X 10(8) iv) at a time of normal plasma fibronectin (590 +/- 37 micrograms/ml) or 5 days later at a time corresponding to elevation of plasma fibronectin (921 +/- 114 micrograms/ml). After the first bacterial challenge, there was a 22% decrease (P less than 0.05) in plasma fibronectin. Lung lymph flow (QL) initially increased 308% (P less than 0.05) by 2 h (0 h = 4.7 +/- 1.1 ml/h; 2 h = 14.4 +/- 3.5 ml/h), and the total protein lymph-to-plasma concentration ratio (L/P) declined. This was followed by a sustained second phase response over 3-12 h which was characterized by a 202-393% elevation in QL (P less than 0.05), an increase in the L/P ratio, and a 240-480% (P less than 0.05) increase in lung transvascular protein clearance (TVPC = QL X L/P). Sheep with elevated fibronectin levels also manifested the early (2 h) elevation in QL (P less than 0.05) coupled with a decline in L/P ratio after the second bacterial challenge, but the second-phase increase in TVPC was markedly attenuated. Intravenous infusion of 500 mg of human plasma fibronectin into normal sheep to elevate the fibronectin level comparable to that in the hyperfibronectinemic sheep also attenuated (P less than 0.05) the second-phase (3-12 h) increase in lung protein clearance with sepsis. Thus elevation of plasma fibronectin during postoperative Gram-negative bacteremia may protect the lung vascular barrier. This response may be mediated by either fibronectin's opsonic support of phagocytic function or its influence on lung endothelial cell adhesion.</ABSTRACT>

- We studied the interdependence of arterial and venous extra-alveolar vessel (EAV) leakage on the rate of pulmonary vascular fluid filtration (measured as the change in lung weight over time). Edema was produced in continually weighed, excised rabbit lungs kept in zone 1 (alveolar pressure = 25 cmH2O) by increasing pulmonary arterial (Ppa) and/or venous (Ppv) pressure from 5 to 20 cmH2O (relative to the lung base) and continuing this hydrostatic stress for 3-5 h. Raising Ppa and Ppv simultaneously produced a lower filtration rate than the sum of the filtration rates obtained when Ppa and Ppv were raised separately, while the lung gained from 20 to 95% of its initial weight. When vascular pressure was elevated in either EAV segment, fluid filtration always decreased rapidly as the lung gained up to 30-45% of its initial weight. Filtration then decreased more slowly. The lungs became isogravimetric at 60 and 85% weight gain when the Ppa or Ppv was elevated, respectively; when Ppa and Ppv were raised simultaneously substantial fluid filtration continued even after 140% weight gain. We conclude that the arterial and venous EAV's share a common interstitium in the zone 1 condition, this interstitium cannot be represented as a single compartment with a fixed resistance and compliance, and arterial and venous EAV leakage influences leakage from the other segment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hypoxia and monosynaptic reflexes in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The recruitment curves of the monosynaptic Hoffmann (H) reflex and of the direct motor (M) excitation of alpha-motor fibers of the posterior popliteal nerve were studied in seven human subjects in normoxic and hypoxic conditions at sea level. The amplitude of the H and M responses were determined from the computerized full-wave rectified and integrated surface electromyographic (EMG) signal derived from bipolar surface electrodes placed over the soleus muscle. Hypoxic exposure [end-tidal O2 fraction (FETO2) = 0.066 +/- 0.003 and end-tidal CO2 fraction (FETCO2) = 0.0504 +/- 0.001 (SE)] did not affect the maximal M (Mmax) response but decreased significantly (7%) the maximal H (Hmax) response. The Hmax/Mmax ratio decreased from 0.60 to 0.53. Furthermore, by fitting the rising phase of the recruitment curves of the H and M responses vs. stimulus intensity with linear regressions, hypoxia was found to produce a significant decrease of similar magnitude (6%) in the threshold of both the H and M responses with no change in slope. Using a constant stimulus strength eliciting an H response of half the maximum (H50%) of the control conditions, hypoxia resulted in a 50% increase in the amplitude of the H response within 12 min. These results suggest that the effects of hypoxia on the nervous system consist of a direct depolarizing action on the peripheral alpha-fibers and 1A sensory fibers and of a central effect on supraspinal structures affecting the spinal alpha-motoneurons.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of substance P on mucus secretion of isolated submucosal gland from feline trachea.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To elucidate how substance P (SP) produces submucosal gland secretion, we examined the effects of SP on the glandular contractile response and 3H-labeled glycoconjugate release in isolated submucosal glands from feline tracheae. SP (10(-12) to 10(-4) M) produced dose-dependent increases in the contractile response, and the maximal tension induced by SP was approximately 70% of the response to methacholine. SP-induced contraction is blocked completely by atropine and augmented by neostigmine. Pretreatment with hemicholinium 3, an acetylcholine synthesis inhibitor, inhibited the contractile response to SP. Pretreatment with tetrodotoxin did not inhibit the contractile response to SP. Capsaicin induced tension of a magnitude similar to that of SP. SP (10(-7) M) produced a significant increase (74% above control) in radiolabeled glycoconjugate release from isolated glands, whereas SP had no significant effects on glycoconjugate release from tracheal explants, probably because of epithelial suppression. Atropine abolished SP-evoked glycoconjugate release in isolated glands. Our findings indicate that 1) SP induces glandular contraction, which is related to the squeezing of mucus in the ducts and secretory tubules, 2) SP stimulates radiolabeled glycoconjugate release in isolated submucosal gland, probably involving mucus synthesis and/or cellular secretion, and 3) these two actions are mediated by a peripheral cholinergic mechanism.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Plasma free and sulfoconjugated catecholamine responses to varying exercise intensity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Plasma free catecholamines rise during exercise, but sulfoconjugated catecholamines reportedly fall. This study examined the relationship between exercise intensity and circulating levels of sulfoconjugated norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. Seven exercise-trained men biked at approximately 30, 60, and 90% of their individual maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) for 8 min. The 90% VO2max period resulted in significantly increased plasma free norepinephrine (rest, 219 +/- 85; exercise, 2,738 +/- 1,149 pg/ml; P less than or equal to 0.01) and epinephrine (rest, 49 +/- 49; exercise, 555 +/- 516 pg/ml; P less than or equal to 0.05). These changes were accompanied by consistent increases in sulfoconjugated norepinephrine at both the 60% (rest, 852 +/- 292; exercise, 1,431 +/- 639; P less than or equal to 0.05) and 90% (rest, 859 +/- 311; exercise, 2,223 +/- 1,015; P less than or equal to 0.05) VO2max periods. Plasma sulfoconjugated epinephrine and dopamine displayed erratic changes at the three exercise intensities. These findings suggest that sulfoconjugated norepinephrine rises during high-intensity exercise.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cold-induced bronchoconstriction: role of cutaneous reflexes vs. direct airway effects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine the relative contributions of direct airway vs. reflex cutaneous thermal receptor stimulation in cold-induced bronchoconstriction, we isolated these two aspects of cold exposure in 10 asthmatics and 13 normal subjects. Ice packs were applied to the skin of the face, chest, thigh, and upper arm in random sequence while serially measuring specific conductance. In this fashion a limited mapping of skin-mediated bronchoconstriction was established. Warm packs were applied to the same areas of control for any potential nonspecific stimulatory effects. Cooling the skin induced bronchoconstriction to a similar degree in both groups; this effect was very small, did not induce symptoms, and was only seen with stimulation of the face. At another time, the subjects performed isocapnic hyperventilation of frigid air to ascertain their response to direct airway cooling. A moderate but significant correlation existed between skin and airway sensitivity; however, the magnitude of the two responses differed markedly. Breathing cold air at rest had no effect on lung function; however, elevating ventilation promptly produced bronchial narrowing. Hence, in a cold environment, the most potent stimulus for the development of airway obstruction in asthmatics derives from a direct airway effect.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dive response of children in relation to cold-water near-drowning.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The strength of the dive response, as judged by the combination of breath-hold duration (BHD) and bradycardia, was compared in 87 children (4-13 yr old) and 68 adults (20-68 yr old) during simulated dives in 29 degrees C water. Mean BHD in children (16.1 s) was only 37.4% (P less than 0.001) of adult BHD (43.0 s). Within children, BHD was significantly (P less than 0.001) dependent on age (A in yr) according to the regression BHD = -1.46 + 2.27A. No age dependency of BHD occurred in adults. Due to the low BHD of children, only 14/87 (16.1%) were able to breath hold for the 25 s necessary to develop full diving bradycardia. For these 14 children, their bradycardia (36.1% reduction) was insignificantly different (P greater than 0.50) from that of adults (36.4%). These experimental findings demonstrate that the dive response of children is extremely weak, due mainly to their very low BHD. Since lower water temperature would probably accentuate the shortness of BHD (according to previous findings for adults), it is concluded that the dive response is unlikely to make a significant contribution to the prolonged resuscitatibility of children who are victims of cold-water near-drowning.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Time-dependent effect of hypoxia on carotid body chemosensory function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The time-dependent effects of hypoxia on the discharge rate carotid chemoreceptors were measured in anesthetized cats. Hypoxic exposure of two different durations were used: a short-term exposure (2-3 h) was used to measure the response of the same carotid chemoreceptors; and a long-term exposure (28 days at inspired PO2 of 70 Torr) to study carotid chemoreceptor properties in one group of cats relative to those of a control group. In the chronically hypoxic and control groups, determinations were made of the 1) steady-state responses to four levels of arterial PO2 (PaO2) at constant levels of arterial PCO2; 2) steady-state responses to acute hypercapnia during hyperoxia; and 3) maximal discharge rates during anoxia. We found that the acute responses of carotid chemoreceptor afferents to a given level of hypoxia (PaO2 = 30-40 Torr) did not significantly change within 2-3 h. After long-term exposure the carotid chemoreceptor responses to hypoxia significantly increased, with no significant changes in the hypercapnic response and in the maximal discharge rate during anoxia. We conclude that isocapnic hypoxia may not elicit a sufficient cellular response within 2-3 h in the cat carotid body to sensitize the O2 responsive mechanism, but hypoxia of longer duration will sensitize such a mechanism, thereby augmenting the chemosensory activity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surfactant-associated protein inhibits phospholipid secretion from type II cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Secretion of [3H]phosphatidylcholine ([3H]PC) from isolated rat pulmonary type II epithelial cells was inhibited by the surfactant-associated protein of Mr = 35,000 (SAP-35) purified from canine lung surfactant. SAP-35 inhibited [3H]PC secretion in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibited basal, phorbol ester, beta-adrenergic, and P2-purinergic agonist-induced [3H]PC secretion. SAP-35 significantly inhibited [3H]PC secretion from 1 to 3 h after treatment. The IC50 for inhibition of [3H]PC secretion by canine SAP-35 was 1-5 X 10(-6) g/ml and was similar for inhibition of both basal and secretagogue-stimulated release. Heat denaturation of SAP-35, addition of monoclonal anti-SAP-35 antibody, reduction and alkylation of SAP-35, or association of SAP-35 with phospholipid vesicles reversed the inhibitory effect on secretagogue-induced secretion. Inhibitory effects of SAP-35 were observed 3 h after cells were washed with buffer that did not contain SAP-35. Although SAP-35 enhanced reassociation of surfactant phospholipid with isolated type II cells, its inhibitory effect on secretion of [3H]PC did not result from stimulation of reuptake of secreted [3H]PC by type II cells. The inhibition of phospholipid secretion by SAP-35 was also not due to inhibition of PC or disaturated PC synthesis by SAP-35. SAP-35, the major phospholipid-associated protein in pulmonary surfactant, is a potent inhibitor of surfactant secretion from type II cells in vitro and may play an important role in homeostasis of surfactant in the alveolar space.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Naloxone reduces ventilatory depression of brain hypoxia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess whether endogenous opioids participate in respiratory depression due to brain hypoxia, we determined the ventilatory response to progressive carboxyhemoglobinemia (1% CO, 40% O2) before and after administration of naloxone (NLX, 0.1 mg/kg iv). Minute ventilation (VI) and ventral medullary surface pH (Vm pH) were measured in six anesthetized, peripherally chemodenervated cats. NLX consistently increased base-line hyperoxic VI from 618 +/- 99 to 729 +/- 126 ml/min (P less than 0.05). Although NLX did not alter the Vm pH response to CO [initial alkalosis, Vm pH +0.011 +/- 0.003 pH units, followed by acidosis, Vm pH -0.082 +/- 0.036 at carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) 55%], NLX attenuated the amount of ventilatory depression; increasing HbCO to 55% decreased VI to 66 +/- 6% of base line before NLX and to 81 +/- 9% of base line after NLX (P less than 0.05). The difference in response after NLX was primarily the result of a linear increase in tidal volume (VT) with decreasing Vm pH (delta VT = 60.3 ml/-pH unit) which was absent before NLX. To assess whether the site of action of the endogenous opioid effect was the central chemosensors, the ventilatory and Vm pH response to progressive HbCO was determined in three additional cats before and after topical application of NLX (3 X 10(-4) M) to the ventral medullary surface. The effect of topical NLX was similar to systemic NLX; significant attenuation of the reduction in VI with increasing HbCO. We conclude that 1) endogenous opioids mediate a portion of the depression of ventilation due to acute brain hypoxia, and 2) this effect is probably at the central chemosensitive regions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of airway wall flexibility on clearance by simulated cough.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In our previous study, we investigated the relationship between mucus rheology, depth of mucus layer, and clearance by simulated cough. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of airway wall flexibility on the clearance of mucuslike gels. Transient airflows similar to cough were generated by both positive and negative pressure, the latter to mimic the dynamic compression that occurs during real cough. As in the previous study, the trachea was modeled as a trough of rectangular cross section with only the bottom lined with the mucus simulant. Clearance was followed by observing the displacement of marker particles. Since cough clearance is intimately related to wave formation in the mucus blanket, we hypothesized that clearance might be impeded if the wave formation occurred simultaneously in the wall and its lining layer. Thus, in one set of experiments the bottom rigid surface of the model trachea was replaced with a frame over which a flexible membrane could be drawn, whereas in the other set the rigid top was replaced by the frame. We also examined the effect of negative-pressure cough in excised canine tracheae, comparing the case where the tracheal membrane was free to deform vs. the case where it was secured. For the rigid-walled model, clearance by positive or negative pressure, with matched flow pattern, was the same. With the mucus simulant lining the flexible bottom surface, clearance increased with increasing membrane flexibility for negative-pressure cough and decreased for positive-pressure cough.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Patterns of EMG activity of rat plantaris muscle during swimming and other locomotor activities.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of the study was to examine the patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activity of the rat plantaris during loaded swimming in comparison with other locomotor activities. Five female Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with chronic bipolar electrodes in the plantaris muscle of the left hindlimb under pentobarbital anesthesia. Characteristics of EMG bursts recorded while the conscious rat was performing treadmill walking (0.24 m/s) were stable and reproducible 10-14 days postsurgery. Following this stabilization period, records of EMG activity were obtained during walking, loaded swimming (6.5 g attached to tail), and several other locomotor tasks. Compared to walking, EMG bursts during loaded swimming were significantly higher (67%) in maximum amplitude, one-third as long in duration, and occurred at a greater rate (4.4 vs. 1.7 bursts/s, P less than 0.05). Swimming bursts were of higher amplitudes than those of all other activities examined and reached 65% of the EMG amplitude recorded following stimulation of the sciatic nerve with supramaximal voltage. The addition of a mass to the animal's tail during swimming did not increase the EMG burst amplitudes but resulted in a higher frequency of bursts. Compared with treadmill walking, loaded swimming elicited burst of high variability in amplitude. Swimming in the rat involves rapid, extensive activation of plantaris, thus providing an exercise model to study the adaptability of the neuromuscular system to prolonged activity of this type.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hysteresis in response to descending and ascending lower-body negative pressure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have investigated the pattern of fluid redistribution and cardiovascular responses during graduated orthostatic stress. Twelve men, age 30-39 yr, underwent a 25-min lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) test protocol that involved sequential stages of LBNP at -8 mmHg (1 min), -16 mmHg (1 min), -30 mmHg (3 min), -40 mmHg (5 min), -50 mmHg (5 min), -40 mmHg (5 min), -30 mmHg (3 min), -16 mmHg (1 min), and -8 mmHg (1 min). Data were recorded at the end of each stage. For many measured variables values during the descending phase of LBNP (-8 to -40 mmHg) were significantly different from values during the ascending phase of (-40 to -8 mmHg). These differences appear to be due to a component of fluid translocation that occurs during LBNP and cannot be reversed within the duration of the procedure. We hypothesize that this slowly reversed component is sequestration of fluid in the interstitial and lymphatic compartments. In contrast, venous pooling is a rapidly reversible component of fluid movement during LBNP. A scheme describing fluid and cardiovascular responses to LBNP based on these data and the data of other investigators is presented.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- O2 delivery to contracting muscle during hypoxic or CO hypoxia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The consequences of a decreased O2 supply to a contracting canine gastrocnemius muscle preparation were investigated during two forms of hypoxia: hypoxic hypoxia (HH) (n = 6) and CO hypoxia (COH) (n = 6). Muscle O2 uptake, blood flow, O2 extraction, and developed tension were measured at rest and at 1 twitch/s isometric contractions in normoxia and in hypoxia. No differences were observed between the two groups at rest. During contractions and hypoxia, however, O2 uptake decreased from the normoxic level in the COH group but not in the HH group. Blood flow increased in both groups during hypoxia, but more so in the COH group. O2 extraction increased further with hypoxia (P less than 0.05) during concentrations in the HH group but actually fell (P less than 0.05) in the COH group. The O2 uptake limitation during COH and contractions was associated with a lesser O2 extraction. The leftward shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve during COH may have impeded tissue O2 extraction. Other factors, however, such as decreased myoglobin function or perfusion heterogeneity must have contributed to the inability to utilize the O2 reserve more fully.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cardiorespiratory responses to chemical activation of right ventricular receptors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous reports have shown that activation of left ventricular receptors with sympathetic afferents elicits increases in respiratory output and arterial pressure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether similar responses are produced by chemical activation of epicardial receptors in the right ventricle. Receptors were stimulated by applying either capsaicin (10 micrograms) or bradykinin (500 ng) to the epicardial surface of the right ventricle in anesthetized cats. Application of either chemical evoked an increase in respiratory output (phrenic nerve activity), a decrease in heart rate, and a nonsignificant increase in arterial pressure in intact cats. However, capsaicin and bradykinin produced significant increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory output after bilateral cervical vagotomy. In contrast, a fall in both heart rate and arterial pressure with only small increases in respiratory output were evoked after bilateral removal of the stellate ganglia in cats with intact vagi. Only small responses to the chemical stimulation of right ventricular receptors persisted after combined vagotomy and stellate ganglionectomy. These findings suggest that 1) activation of epicardial receptors with sympathetic afferents originating in the right ventricle causes an increase in cardiorespiratory function, and 2) activation of right ventricular receptors with vagal afferents produces decreases in heart rate and arterial pressure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Factors producing elevated core temperature in spontaneously hypertensive rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Core temperature (Tco) of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is consistently higher by approximately 1 degree C than that of normotensive controls. To analyze factors producing the elevated Tco, mean skin temperature (Tsk), metabolic heat production (M), respiratory evaporative heat loss (Eres), effective tissue thermal conductance (K), systolic blood pressure (BP), and Tco were determined in eight male SHR and nine male normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats habituated to rest quietly in neck stock restraint while exposed to ambient temperatures (Ta) of 12.5, 17, 23, 28.5, 32, 34, and 35 degrees C. At all temperatures steady-state BP, Tco, and M were higher for SHR's than for WKY's. SHR's could maintain thermal balance up to Ta 32 degrees C, and WKY's up to 34 degrees C. Eres from SHR's was greater than from WKY's at Ta of 12.5, 17, and 28.5 degrees C. K of SHR's was not different from or was higher than K of WKY's, and K for both groups was 2.6 times greater at Ta 32 degrees C than at 17 degrees C. These results indicate that the high Tco of SHR's is due to increased M uncompensated by increased K or Eres.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibitory effect of almitrine on dopaminergic activity of rat carotid body.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Almitrine increases ventilation by stimulating the peripheral arterial chemoreceptors. This study assessed the effects of acute and chronic almitrine treatments on the dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) contents and utilization rates in the rat carotid body. Almitrine (5 mg/kg ip) caused a 34% reduction in DA content after 30 min. Extending the almitrine treatment for 15 days (one daily ip injection) produced a further progressive diminution in DA stores (-55%; P less than 0.01). The utilization rate of DA measured after inhibiting catecholamine biosynthesis by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine was strongly reduced by almitrine (-98% after 15 days; P less than 0.01). The effects of almitrine were dose dependent. The noradrenergic activity was much less altered by the drug. The data showed that almitrine can modify the dynamics of DA in rat carotid body producing a decrease in both content and utilization rate.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Enhanced fibrin formation in high-altitude pulmonary edema.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and arterial blood gases were examined in 66 nonacclimatized mountaineers at 4,557 m. Subjects were classified according to a clinical score as healthy (n = 25), having mild acute mountain sickness (AMS) (n = 24), showing severe AMS (n = 13), and suffering from high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) (n = 4). Coagulation times, euglobulin lysis time, and fibrin(ogen) fragment E were normal in all groups without significant changes. Fibrinopeptide A (FPA), a molecular marker of in vivo fibrin formation, was elevated in HAPE to 4.2 +/- 2.7 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001) compared with the other groups showing mean values between 1.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.8 +/- 0.7 ng/ml. FPA was normal in one patient with HAPE, however. Severe AMS was accompanied by a significant decrease in arterial PO2 due to an increase in alveolar-arterial O2 difference, whereas arterial PCO2 did not change significantly. We conclude that activation of blood coagulation is not involved in the pathogenesis of AMS and the impairment of gas exchange in this disease. Fibrin generation occurring in HAPE is probably an epiphenomenon of edema formation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Electrolyte composition changes of chronically K-depleted rats after K loading.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The responses of whole body, skeletal muscle, and plasma to oral K loading were studied in K-depleted male rats. Potassium depletion was induced by feeding the rats a K-deficient diet for 4 wk and injecting deoxycorticosterone acetate during the first week. After 4 wk, the rats were growth retarded and hypokalemic (1.9 mmol/l plasma) and had low whole-body and muscle K content, 188 +/- 27 and 276 +/- 19 mmol/kg fat-free dried tissue (FFDT), respectively, compared with 296 +/- 10 and 454 +/- 13 mmol/kg FFDT for the control group. Sodium and water retention also occurred in the K-deficient group. After K depletion, the rats were divided into four groups and received either 0, 1, 2, or 3 intragastric doses of 10 mmol KCl/kg at 8-h intervals. The rats were killed 8 h after the last dose. Control rats were treated similarly. K-depleted and control rats responded differently to K loading. In the normal rats, plasma K remained at 5.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, muscle K increased to 502 +/- 24 mmol/kg, and muscle K/N ratio increased from 3.0 to 3.4 mmol/g. In the K-depleted rats, plasma K increased to 7.2 +/- 0.7 mmol/l, muscle K increased to 453 +/- 50 mmol/kg, and muscle K/N ratio increased from 1.8 to 3.1 mmol/g. These data indicate that the capacity of the muscles to accumulate K was impaired after severe K depletion and caused elevated plasma K levels when repletion was complete.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Three-dimensional reconstruction of the rat acinus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study provides a quantitative description of the small airways and alveolar duct-alveolar architecture of the rat lung. To accomplish this, quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions were made of small airways, the alveolar duct system, and alveoli. The branching pattern of the small airways immediately proximal to the alveolar ducts varied significantly. For example, the number of bronchiole-alveolar duct junctions per parent bronchus (terminal bronchiole) ranged from two to six. The number of bronchiole-alveolar duct junctions per lung was 7,280 +/- 250 (mean +/- SE). The general shape of the ventilatory unit arising from each bronchiole-alveolar junction was that of a space-filling sphere with an outer diameter of 1,490 +/- 130 microns. The average distance from the bronchiole-alveolar duct junction to alveoli at the end of the alveolar sac termination was 1,290 +/- 100 microns. Numerous trifurcations were found in the branching pattern of the alveolar ducts. The branching of the alveolar ducts did not fit a regular dichotomous pattern. The volume of the terminal branches (alveolar sacs) accounted for 64 +/- 5% of the volume of the ventilatory unit. Both of these factors, the pattern of branching and the substantial volume distributed in the most peripheral branches, contribute to the uniform distribution of gas within the ventilatory unit and thus minimize potential diffusion limitations to gas exchange.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in left ventricular geometry during spontaneous breathing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of these experiments was to determine the effects of a spontaneously generated inspiration on the size and shape of the left ventricle (LV) in anesthetized supine dogs. We implanted markers in the LV to establish three perpendicular axes and recorded the motion of these markers using biplane cinefluoroscopy at 60 Hz. The primary changes in LV size that accompanied inspiration occurred at end diastole (ED). The largest change in LVED dimension was a 2.46-mm narrowing of the septal-lateral wall dimension, but the apex-base dimension decreased also, by 0.74 mm. The anteroposterior dimension actually widened by 1.07 mm. The septal-lateral narrowing was caused by both a 1.0-mm narrowing of the distance between the septal marker and the apex-base axis, as well as by a 1.4-mm narrowing between the apex-base axis and the lateral wall marker. Narrowing of the septal portion seemed expected because of presumed enhanced right ventricular filling during inspiration. Narrowing of the lateral portion of the LV, while the anteroposterior dimension widened, was surprising because a change in LVEDV shape is implied. Assuming ventricular homogeneity, this change in LVED shape implies that the forces applied to the epicardial surface were not uniform. There must have been a retraction on the anterior and posterior surface that was not experienced by the lateral LV wall. The net effect of these dimensional changes of the LV at end diastole (estimated from the product of the three ED axes) was a 3.5-cm3 reduction in LVED volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percent carboxyhemoglobin in resting humans exposed repeatedly to 1,500 and 7,500 ppm CO.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Eleven nonsmoking male resting subjects were exposed to two transient CO profiles to examine whether the resultant carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) differs with CO concentration for a fixed total CO dose and to determine the predictive capability of the theoretical model of Coburn et al. (J. Clin. Invest. 44: 1899-1910, 1965) using measured alveolar ventilation. One profile consisted of five sequential exposures to 1,500 ppm CO for 5 min each and spaced 3 min apart. The other consisted of five sequential exposures to 7,500 ppm CO for 1 min each and spaced 7 min apart. The subjects, therefore, were exposed to the same overall nominal dose of 37,500 ppm.min. During the experiment, the subject's ventilatory functions and respiratory gases were recorded continuously, and the resultant HbCO% was measured in venous blood samples by gas chromatography. Mean increase (+/- SD) in HbCO% per exposure was 2.08 +/- 0.27% for the 1,500 ppm CO exposures and 2.05 +/- 0.29% for the 7,500 ppm CO exposures with no significant difference between the two. When the measured values of the subject's alveolar ventilation were applied to the theoretical model of Coburn et al., the predicted rate of HbCO% formation was found to agree with the experimental results.</ABSTRACT>

SAM flux began between 0.82 and 0.85 gestation in the females and between 0.85 and 0.89 gestation in the males and matured more rapidly thereafter in the females than in the males (P less than 0.01). beta-Adrenergic receptor binding, using [3H]dihydroalprenolol as the ligand, was saturable, linear, and stereospecific. The order of potency of competitive beta-agonists was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine. The maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of pulmonary beta-receptors approximately doubled between 0.84 and 0.89 gestation, coinciding with the onset of SAM flux. Bmax matured as a third degree polynomial function of gestational age in females (r = 0.9, P less than 0.001) but as a linear function in males (r = 0.8, P less than 0.005). Between 0.86 and 0.93 gestation, Bmax was 1.45-fold greater in females than males (P less than 0.001). The dissociation constant of beta-receptors was not influenced significantly by gender or gestation. We conclude that maturation of pulmonary beta-receptors coincides with the onset of SAM flux in fetal lambs and that both mature more rapidly in females. We speculate that pulmonary beta-receptor maturation and SAM flux are coregulated by hormonal factors. More rapid maturation of pulmonary beta-receptors and SAM flux in females may be a factor in the female advantage with regard to pulmonary surfactant maturation and the survival of premature neonates.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of blood pressure on force production in cat and human muscle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In anesthetized cats reducing local arterial pressure from 125 to 75 Torr decreased blood flow (53 +/- 5%) and force production (57 +/- 7%) in soleus and medial gastrocnemius. Force was produced in these muscles by aerobic, slowly fatiguing fibers. Similar reductions in arterial pressure did not affect force production in caudofemoralis, which contains mainly fast-fatiguing fibers. In human subjects the electromyogram produced by the ankle extensors during rhythmic constant-force contractions increased as the contracting muscles were raised above the heart during legs-up tilt. This suggests that force production of active muscle fibers at a given level of activation fell with muscle perfusion pressure, thus requiring augmentation of muscle activity to sustain the standard contractions. Because aerobic fibers contributed to these contractions, it appears that force production of human muscle fibers is sensitive to small changes in perfusion pressure and, presumably, blood flow. The critical dependence of developed muscular force on blood pressure is of importance to motor control and may also play a significant role in cardiovascular control during exercise.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antioxidants protect cultured bovine lung endothelial cells from injury by endotoxin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Endotoxin injures bovine pulmonary endothelial cells in culture but the cytotoxicity is unaffected by a host of antiinflammatory drugs. We hypothesized that agents which could decrease intracellular concentrations of toxic metabolites of O2 would prevent endotoxin effects on cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells. We measured endotoxin-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from and production of prostanoids by cultured bovine pulmonary endothelial cells in the presence and absence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Escherichia coli endotoxin (0.001-10 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-related release of LDH and stimulated production of both prostacyclin [measured as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha)] and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Both DMSO and allopurinol decreased endotoxin-induced LDH release; this effect was related to concentration of the drugs (0-2% for DMSO and 0-0.3 mg/ml for allopurinol). Both drugs also prevented endotoxin-induced changes in endothelial morphology. Endotoxin increased intracellular reduction of the redox dye nitro blue tetrazolium, caused intracellular oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and caused release of conjugated dienes from endothelial cells; both DMSO and allopurinol inhibited those responses. DMSO, but not allopurinol, prevented endotoxin-induced production of prostacyclin and PGE2 by endothelium. Direct injury of pulmonary endothelium by endotoxin is inhibited by two chemically dissimilar drugs which have a common potential for decreasing intracellular concentrations of toxic metabolites of O2; indirect evidence suggests that potential as a mechanism for the protective effects of the drugs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Does rib cage-abdominal paradox signify respiratory muscle fatigue?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Studies suggesting that abnormal motion of the rib cage (RC) and abdomen (Ab) may indicate respiratory muscle fatigue have not separated the influence of respiratory load from that of fatigue in its pathogenesis. We hypothesized that abnormalities on RC-Ab motion are primarily related to increased load rather than fatigue. We tested this hypothesis in subjects breathing against resistive loads while maintaining 30 and 60% of maximum mouth pressure (Pmmax). RC-Ab asynchrony and paradox and the degree of variation in compartmental contribution to tidal volume were measured by inductive plethysmography and quantitated by the Konno-Mead method of analysis. Comparing measurements of base line and 30 and 60% of Pmmax indicated that the degree of asynchrony, paradox, and variation in compartmental contribution were significantly related to the level of the load; significant abnormalities were observed at even 30% of Pmmax, a target pressure that can be sustained indefinitely. In another group of subjects, fatigue was induced by sustaining 60% of Pmmax to the limits of tolerance. Indexes of abnormal RC-Ab motion increased from base line during the 1st min of loaded breathing but displayed no progression from the beginning to the end of the fatigue run. Immediately on discontinuation of the load, the indexes returned to levels similar to base line despite persistence of the fatigue state. These results in healthy subjects breathing against severe resistances indicate that RC-Ab asynchrony and paradox and variation in compartmental contribution to tidal volume are predominantly due to increases in respiratory load rather than muscle fatigue.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Information content of multiple inert gas elimination measurements.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The multiple inert gas elimination technique provides a fundamental assessment of the distribution of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) ratios in the lung. The resolution of the finer structure of this distribution is limited however. This study examines the theoretical basis of this limitation and presents an objective method for evaluating the independence of inert gas measurements. It demonstrates the linear dependence of the inert gas kernels and their filtering characteristics to be the factors most limiting information content. The limited number of gases available for measurement and experimental error are lesser limitations. At usual levels of experimental error, no more than seven different inert gases having partition coefficients between those of SF6 and acetone will provide independent information, and information content will be maximized by choosing gases with partition coefficients spaced equally on a logarithmic scale. A fivefold reduction in experimental error will not significantly alter the information content of the measurements. The analysis applies equally to other methods of multiple inert gas elimination data interpretation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Detailed characterization of a tank used for head-out water immersion in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Water immersion has long been known to produce marked diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis and suppression of the renin-aldosterone system. These effects are mediated primarily by an increase in central blood volume. Immersion has therefore gained increased acceptance in human physiology for the investigation of the effects of central volume expansion on renal function and hormonal responsiveness without altering the composition of the extracellular fluid. An immersion tank used for studies in humans is described. Requisite features to ensure study reproducibility include a constant temperature, capability to alter the depth of immersion by adjusting water height, and the ability to maintain hygienic quality by means of constant circulation of the water through a sand filter. A constant temperature of 34.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C is maintained by thermostatically controlling the heat exchange to a unidirectional closed-circuit water system in the bottom of the immersion tank coursing through a stream source. The level of the water may be adjusted to any desired level by means of a waste line or an inlet of tap water.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Estimating left ventricular offset volume using dual-frequency conductance catheters.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The measurement of left ventricular volume by the conductance-catheter technique has many advantages, but it is difficult to determine absolute volumes with this method. Current procedure requires that a bolus of concentrated hypertonic saline be injected to measure absolute volume. It also demands that the subject be in a steady state and that measurements only be made at discrete intervals. The saline bolus may affect the cardiovascular state of the subject. This paper describes a new technique for estimating absolute volume utilizing the conductance catheter that relies on the different frequency responses of blood and muscle. Good correlation between the salt-injection method and the dual-frequency method was found in nine closed-chest pigs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (r = 0.922). Further refinements may extend the utility of the dual-frequency approach.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Operation Everest II: man at extreme altitude.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Rapid ascent to high altitude may cause serious problems for climbers, skiers, and aviators. In contrast, gradual ascent enables humans to function where the unacclimatized cannot. To examine changes in the O2 transport system that produce acclimatization, eight men were taken in a decompression chamber (without other stresses experienced on high mountains) to a simulated altitude of 8,840 m (29,028 ft, ambient PO2 = 43 Torr) in 40 days. Maximal O2 uptake fell to 1.2 l/min, and arterial PO2 and PCO2 were 30 and 11 Torr, respectively, with arterial pH of 7.56. Many sophisticated studies were done: Swan-Ganz catheterization and inert gas diffusion studies at three altitudes showed that normal cardiac function persisted, pulmonary vascular resistance increased and at extreme altitude was not lowered by O2, and pulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch increased, though variably. This appears to be an important factor limiting performance at extreme altitude. This paper presents the background, general approach, and a summary of major observations reported in detail in other papers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regional trapping of microspheres in the lung compares well with regional blood flow.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Microspheres (MS) are often used to measure the distribution of pulmonary blood flow in the assumption that the number of MS trapped in a region is proportional to blood flow. However, regional distribution of trapped MS has not been directly compared with regional blood flow in the lung. Regional trapping of MS was compared with regional flow of erythrocytes (RBC's) in isolated, perfused left lungs of dogs. Radioactivity from labeled MS and RBC's was measured by external detection using a gamma camera. We defined six regions of interest in the image of the left lateral surface of the lung: a dorsocaudal, a caudal, two ventral, an apical, and a central region. In each lung, regional trapping of MS was measured from the image of radioactivity obtained after slow injection of a suspension of MS into the arterial perfusion tubing. A radioactive bolus of labeled RBC's was injected during rapid imaging of the lung to obtain radioactivity vs. time curves from each region. The peaks of the regional radioactivity vs. time curves were used to estimate regional flows, though compensation had to be made for overlap of the washout and washin phases of the bolus of labeled RBC's. The results indicated that there were no differences in the regional distribution of MS compared with the regional distribution of RBC flow in isolated, perfused dog lungs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Continuous monitoring of blood volume changes in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The mass density of antecubital venous blood was measured continuously for 80 min/session with 0.1 g/l precision at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min in six male subjects. Each person participated in two different sessions with the same protocol. To induce transvascular fluid shifts, the subjects changed from sitting to standing and from standing to supine positions. There was transient blood density shifts immediately after postural changes, followed by an asymptotic approach to a new steady-state blood density level. Additional deviations from a simple time course were regularly observed. Blood density increased by 3.5 +/- 1.4 (SD) g/l when standing after sitting and decreased by 5.0 +/- 1.2 g/l while supine after standing. The corresponding half time of the blood density increase was 5.6 +/- 1.4 min (standing after sitting) and 6.9 +/- 3.1 min (supine after standing) of the blood density decrease. Erythrocyte density was calculated and did not change with body position. Whole-body blood density was calculated from plasma density, hematocrit, and erythrocyte density, assuming an F-cell ratio of 0.91. Volume shifts were computed from the density data; the subject's blood volume density decreased by 6.2 +/- 1.2% from sitting to standing and increased by 8.5 +/- 2.1% from standing to supine. Additional discrete plasma density and hematocrit measurements gave linear relations (P less than 0.001) between all possible combinations of blood density, plasma density, and hematocrit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hypoxia-induced inhibition of converting enzyme activity: role in vascular regulation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Systemic and pulmonary vascular reactivity to graded doses of angiotensin I (ANG I), angiotensin II (ANG II), and, as a control, phenylephrine were examined in 14- or 28-day hypoxia-exposed and air control rats. Hypoxic rats exhibited pulmonary hypertension that was reversible on return to room air, but systemic arterial pressure was not altered by hypoxia. Systemic pressor responses to ANG I and ANG II were significantly less in the hypoxic rats than in the control rats at 14 and 28 days but returned to control levels in hypoxic animals that were then returned to room air, demonstrating reversibility of the hypoxia-induced changes in vascular reactivity. Pulmonary pressor responses to ANG I were significantly less at 14 days, whereas responses to ANG II were significantly greater at 28 days, in hypoxic rats than in controls. There were no significant differences in systemic and pulmonary pressor responses to phenylephrine between the hypoxic and air control animals. The altered systemic and pulmonary pressor responsiveness to ANG I and ANG II in hypoxic rats is probably related to mechanisms specific to the renin-angiotensin system, such as inhibition of intrapulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and down regulation of ANG II receptors in the systemic circulation. Further study is needed to elucidate these mechanisms.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Control of ventilation in elite synchronized swimmers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Synchronized swimmers perform strenuous underwater exercise during prolonged breath holds. To investigate the role of the control of ventilation and lung volumes in these athletes, we studied the 10 members of the National Synchronized Swim Team including an olympic gold medalist and 10 age-matched controls. We evaluated static pulmonary function, hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory drives, and normoxic and hyperoxic breath holding. Synchronized swimmers had an increased total lung capacity and vital capacity compared with controls (P less than 0.005). The hypoxic ventilatory response (expressed as the hyperbolic shape parameter A) was lower in the synchronized swimmers than controls with a mean value of 29.2 +/- 2.6 (SE) and 65.6 +/- 7.1, respectively (P less than 0.001). The hypercapnic ventilatory response [expressed as S, minute ventilation (1/min)/alveolar CO2 partial pressure (Torr)] was no different between synchronized swimmers and controls. Breath-hold duration during normoxia was greater in the synchronized swimmers, with a mean value of 108.6 +/- 4.8 (SE) vs. 68.03 +/- 8.1 s in the controls (P less than 0.001). No difference was seen in hyperoxic breath-hold times between groups. During breath holding synchronized swimmers demonstrated marked apneic bradycardia expressed as either absolute or heart rate change from basal heart rate as opposed to the controls, in whom heart rate increased during breath holds. Therefore the results show that elite synchronized swimmers have increased lung volumes, blunted hypoxic ventilatory responses, and a marked apneic bradycardia that may provide physiological characteristics that offer a competitive advantage for championship performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of the pericardium on right and left ventricular filling in the dog.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We compared the influence of the pericardium on left and right ventricular (LV, RV) filling by measuring LV and RV pressures and segment lengths (SL, LV free wall, and RV inflow and outflow tracts) in six open-chest, pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs before and after pericardiectomy. End-diastolic pressure (EDP) was varied by partial caval occlusion and dextran infusion. At each site the ln EDP-SL relation was fitted by linear regression and characterized by its slope and 1-Torr EDP intercept. The slope and 1-Torr intercept of the LV ln EDP-SL relation changed variably after pericardiectomy, but in each dog a change occurred that shifted this relation downward. In contrast, the RV inflow tract slope invariably decreased significantly after pericardiectomy, whereas its intercept was unchanged in all but one dog. The RV outflow tract results were similar to the inflow tract but less consistent. By the use of the raw EDP-SL data points, we calculated that the absolute contribution of the pericardium to EDP (i.e., the effective pericardial surface pressure) was similar at the three sites. However, as EDP values increased the proportional contribution of the pericardium to right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) increased, whereas that to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) remained relatively constant. As a result, at the higher EDP values tested, the pericardium was responsible for a larger proportion of RVEDP than LVEDP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in quantity, composition, and surface activity of alveolar surfactant at birth.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We hypothesized that when the lung makes the transition from the fluid- to the air-filled state at birth, there are changes in physical and functional properties of the alveolar surfactant. To test this hypothesis, newborn rabbits were killed at different times in the first 24 h of life, their lungs lavaged with ice-cold saline, and the lavage fluid subfractionated by differential centrifugation. The phospholipid and protein content and composition and the kinetics of surface tension lowering of the subfractions were examined. We found that with the onset of breathing, shifts occur in the distribution of surfactant subfractions as a surfactant apoprotein-free phospholipid fraction is generated. The ratio of rapidly sedimentable apoprotein-rich to slowly sedimentable, apoprotein-free fractions decreases from 31 at birth to 4 at 24 h of life. Concurrently, rates of surface tension lowering by the subfractions increase with time. The results suggest that the adult pattern of pool sizes and surface activity of alveolar surfactant is not present at birth but evolves slowly over the 1st day of life.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ventilatory effects of stimulation of phrenic afferents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The diaphragm, a ventilatory muscle, has abundant sensory innervation. The effects of phrenic afferent activation on ventilation have been varied. In this study the proximal end of the phrenic nerve was electrically stimulated, and the effects on ventilation were measured in supine dogs anesthetized with either alpha-chloralose or pentobarbital sodium. We found a maximum increase in ventilation of 45 +/- 4% in the alpha-chloralose group and an increase in mean arterial blood pressure of 18 +/- 4%. This response was obtained at high stimulus intensities (60 times twitch threshold). Stimulation of the proximal end of the gastrocnemius nerve produced a similar ventilatory response (61 +/- 10%) but at lower stimulus intensities. During pentobarbital sodium anesthesia both the hyperventilation and the pressor response were produced; however, ventilation was increased by an increase in respiratory frequency. The reflex was abolished by sectioning of the cervical dorsal roots (C4-C7). Proximal cold blockade of the nerve abolished the response at a perineural temperature of 1.35 +/- 0.64 degrees C. The main effect of activation of phrenic afferents was an increase in ventilation and blood pressure that was mediated by unmyelinated fibers and possibly thin myelinated fibers. This response is similar to skeletal muscle afferent activation and may play a role in ventilatory drive during such conditions as exercise and respiratory muscle fatigue.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Absence of regional differences in the size and oxidative capacity of diaphragm muscle fibers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The oxidative capacity and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers were compared between the costal and crural regions of the cat diaphragm and across the abdominal-thoracic extent of the muscle. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of individual fibers was quantified using a microphotometric procedure implemented on an image-processing system. In both costal and crural regions, population distributions of SDH activities were unimodal for both type I and II fibers. The continuous distribution of SDH activities for type II fibers indicated that no clear threshold exists for the subclassification of fibers based on differences in oxidative capacity (e.g., the classification of fast-twitch glycolytic and fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fiber types). No differences in either SDH activity or cross-sectional area were noted between fiber populations of the costal and crural regions. Differences in SDH activity and cross-sectional area were noted, however, between fiber populations located on the abdominal and thoracic sides of the costal region. Both type I and II fibers on the abdominal side of the costal diaphragm were larger and more oxidative than comparable fibers on the thoracic side.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of age on heat-activated sweat gland density and flow during exercise in dry heat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Physiological responses of eight postmenopausal older women (age 52-62 yr) and eight younger women (age 20-30 yr) were compared during moderate intensity exercise in a hot dry environment (48 degrees C dry bulb, 25 degrees C wet bulb). The age groups were matched on the basis of maximal O2 consumption (VO2max), body surface area, and body fatness. After heat acclimation the women walked at 40% VO2max for up to 2 h in the hot dry environment while heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (Tre), mean skin temperature (Tsk), whole-body sweating rate (Msw), and local sweating rates (msw; forearm, chest, and scapula) were measured. Additionally, the density of heat-activated sweat glands (HASG) was determined and average sweat gland flow (SGF) was calculated for the scapular area. Although no differences between age groups were found in HR response (when analyzed as percent of maximal HR) or Tsk, the older women had a significantly higher Tre throughout the heat-exercise session. The greater heat storage of the older women may be explained by their significantly lower Msw and msw. There were no differences between the younger and older women in the density of HASG after 30 min; therefore, the lower msw reflects a diminished output per HASG rather than a decrease in the number of sweat glands recruited. The diminished thermoregulatory ability of the older women, unrelated to differences in VO2max, appears to reflect either 1) a diminished response of the sweat glands to central and/or peripheral stimuli, or 2) an age-related structural alteration in the eccrine glands or surrounding skin cells.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physiologically derived critical evaporative coefficients for protective clothing ensembles.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- When work is performed in heavy clothing, evaporation of sweat from the skin to the environment is limited by layers of wet clothing and air. The magnitude of decrement in evaporative cooling is a function of the clothing's resistance to permeation of water vapor. A physiological approach has been used to derive effective evaporative coefficients (he) which define this ability to evaporate sweat. We refined this approach by correcting the critical effective evaporative coefficient (K for sweating efficiency (Ke,eta') since only a portion of the sweat produced under such conditions is evaporated through the clothing. Six acclimated men and women walked at 30% maximal O2 consumption (150-200 W.m-2) at a constant dry bulb temperature as ambient water vapor pressure was systematically increased 1 Torr every 10 min. Critical pressure was defined as the partial pressure of water vapor (Pw) at which thermal balance could no longer be maintained and rectal temperature rose sharply. Each test was performed in various clothing ensembles ranging from cotton shirt and pants to "impermeable" suits. This approach was used to derive he by solving the general heat balance equation, M - W +/- (R + C) = w.he.(Psk - Pw), where M is metabolic heat production, W is external work, R is radiant heat exchange, C is convective heat transfer, w is skin wettedness, and Psk is water vapor pressure of fully wet skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Age-dependent effects of chronic hypoxia on pulmonary vascular reactivity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Effects of age on the pulmonary vascular responses to histamine (HIST), norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and KCl were studied in isolated, perfused lungs from juvenile (7-wk-old), adult (14-wk-old), and mature adult (28-wk-old) normoxic rats and compared with age-matched rats exposed to chronic hypoxia for either 14 or 28 days. Chronic hypoxia changed vasoconstriction to HIST and NE to vasodilation in lungs from juvenile and adult rats. Mature adult lungs only vasoconstricted to these amines in both control and hypoxic animals. Pressor responses to 5-HT were not affected by chronic hypoxia regardless of age group. Pressor responses to KCl were also not altered by hypoxia, but lungs from older rats showed greater control responsiveness to KCl compared with lungs from juveniles. Only lungs from juvenile animals developed significant elevations of base-line resistance as a result of hypoxic exposure. To investigate the contribution of H1-, H2-, and beta-receptors in these changes, we employed chlorpheniramine, metiamide, and propranolol, respectively, as blocking agents in another series of experiments. Chlorpheniramine either reduced vasoconstriction or increased vasodilation to HIST in lungs from both control and hypoxic animals, whereas metiamide was without effect. Propranolol either increased vasoconstriction or reversed vasodilation to HIST and NE in all lungs studied. The present data demonstrate the important interaction between chronic hypoxia and age that can alter pulmonary vascular tone and reactivity. The inverse relationship between age and elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance after chronic hypoxic exposure may be the key element that changes pulmonary vascular reactivity observed during hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- An analysis of decrements in vital capacity as an index of pulmonary oxygen toxicity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Decrements in vital capacity (% delta VC) were proposed by the Pennsylvania group in the early 1970s as an index of O2-induced lung damage. These workers used the combined effects of PO2 and time of exposure to develop recommendations to limit expected % delta VC. Adopting this general approach, we fitted human pulmonary O2 toxicity data to the hyperbolic equation % delta VC = Bs.(PO2 - B1).(time)B3 using a nonlinear least squares analysis. In addition to the data considered in 1970, our analysis included new data available from the literature. The best fit was obtained when 1) an individual slope parameter, Bs, was estimated for each subject instead of an average slope; 2) PO2 asymptote B1 = 0.38 ATA; and 3) exponent B3 = 1.0. Wide individual variation imposed large uncertainty on any % delta VC prediction. A 12-h exposure to a PO2 of 1 ATA would be expected to yield a median VC decrement of 4%. The 80% confidence limits, however, included changes from +1.0 and -12% delta VC. Until an improved index of pulmonary O2 toxicity is developed, a simplified expression % delta VC = -0.011.(PO2 - 0.5).time (PO2 in ATA and time in min) can be used to predict a median response with little loss in predictability. The limitations of changes in VC as an index are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Measurement of pleural pressure at low and high frequencies in normal rabbits.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In eight tracheotomized adult rabbits placed in the supine position, we employed a catheter-tip piezoresistive pressure transducer to measure esophageal pressure (Pes) and assessed the validity of taking the changes in Pes to be the changes in pleural pressure (Ppl). We applied an occlusion test in which the tracheal cannula was occluded during either spontaneous inspiratory efforts or body surface oscillations ranging from 3 to 50 Hz. The relationship between Pes and airway opening pressure (Pao) was recorded. In all instances, the changes in Pes and Pao were virtually identical in both amplitude and phase. We conclude that, as evaluated by the occlusion test, a catheter-tip pressure transducer placed in the esophagus of rabbits can give adequate estimation of local pleural changes up to at least 50 Hz.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Increased bronchovascular permeability after allergen exposure in sensitive asthmatics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To investigate the possibility that an increase in bronchovascular permeability is associated with allergen exposure in sensitive asthmatics we evaluated the amounts of serum proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) effluents before and after local challenge with allergen. After exposure of sensitive asthmatic airways (n = 15) to allergen significant increases in total protein compared with controls were observed: 0.08 +/- 0.01 mg/ml in control airways and 0.13 +/- 0.02 mg/ml in challenged airways; P less than 0.05. The greatest changes induced by allergen exposure involved small-molecular-weight proteins (less than 345,000) and an inverse correlation was observed between log molecular weight and percent increase in the concentrations of the specific proteins; r = -0.61. BAL-serum distribution coefficients of serum proteins in airway fluids reflected a greater diffusability of low-molecular-weight proteins immediately after allergen exposure. We also evaluated the movement of serum proteins into lung after local allergen exposure using intravenously administered 99mTc-albumin (n = 10) and found an immediate 3.8-fold increase in amounts of radioactive albumin in allergen exposed airways compared with airways exposed to diluent. Most of the radioactivity was recovered in the first 5 ml of aliquot withdrawn, suggesting a marked increase in the permeability of the bronchial (large airway) vascular-epithelial membrane. An increase in serum proteins was also observed in BAL fluid of asthmatics 2-4 h after aerosol challenge (n = 4), including all proteins in the molecular weight range 45,000-900,000. These studies suggest that allergen exposure in sensitive asthmatics causes an acute increase in bronchovascular permeability to serum proteins.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Isometric contractile properties of diaphragm strips from alcoholic rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Chronic ethanol consumption alters the structure and function of human respiratory muscle. We have examined its effect on the active and passive mechanical properties of rat diaphragm strips in vitro. We conditioned eight rats using a liquid diet containing ethanol as 36% of calories. Eight control rats were pair-fed an isocaloric, ethanol-free liquid diet. Rats were killed after 23 wk. Two strips from the left hemidiaphragm were suspended in Krebs-Ringers solution at 25 degrees C, equilibrated with 5% CO2-95% O2. Isometric stresses were calculated from force transducer measurements. Strips were stimulated directly at supramaximal voltage. Twitch stress (Pt), measured at optimal length (Lo), was greater in ethanol-conditioned strips: 5.1 vs. 3.8 N/cm2. Times to peak Pt and twitch half-relaxation times were equal. Tetanic stress at Lo (Po) was also greater after ethanol conditioning: 17.2 vs. 12.8 N/cm2. Pt/Po ratios were equal. Expressed as %Po, tetanic stress-stimulation frequency curves and tetanic stress-length curves were identical. Ethanol-conditioned strips were marginally less compliant when passively stretched to lengths between Lo and 130% Lo. We postulate that ethanol may have increased active stress development by reducing intracellular free water.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of the parasympathetic nervous system in airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone inhalation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Airway hyperresponsiveness develops in dogs after ozone inhalation. This study examined the role of the parasympathetic nervous system in ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in dogs. Dose-response curves to acetylcholine (n = 8) and histamine (n = 4) were measured before and after exposure to ozone (3 ppm for 30 min). The provocative concentration of each agonist was measured on two randomly assigned days separated by at least 1 wk. On one day a control experiment was performed, and on the other day the dogs were pretreated with the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium bromide in doses that block ganglionic transmission. The acetylcholine provocative concentration decreased on the control day from 5.5 mg/ml (%SE 1.8) before ozone to 0.5 mg/ml (%SE 2.0) after ozone (P less than 0.0001). After pretreatment with hexamethonium the acetylcholine provocative concentration decreased from 9.0 mg/ml (%SE 1.8) before ozone to 1.0 mg/ml (%SE 2.0) after ozone (P = 0.002). The results were similar when histamine was used as the agonist. Therefore, ganglionic blockade does not prevent airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone inhalation, and a parasympathetic reflex mechanism is not responsible for airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone inhalation in dogs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Collagen and elastin fibers in human pulmonary alveolar mouths and ducts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To provide a quantitative basis for the understanding of the mechanical properties of the lung tissue, the morphology of the pulmonary alveolar ducts was studied and the dimensions of the collagen and elastin fiber bundles in the alveolar mouths were measured. Statistical data are presented in this report. It was found that the probability frequency functions of the widths of both the collagen and elastin fibers are skewed to the right, but the fourth roots of the widths are normally distributed. Hence, knowing the mean and standard deviation of (width)1/4, the probability of finding fiber bundles of width D is known. On the other hand, we already know the analytic expressions of the strain energy per unit length of fibers of given width. With the probability distribution of width and an estimation of the length of alveolar mouths, the strain energy of the alveolar mouths can be computed. Then the contribution of the alveolar mouths to the stress in the lung parenchyma due to any strain can be obtained by a differentiation of the strain energy function with respect to that strain.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Airway deposition of hygroscopic heterodispersed aerosols: results of a computer calculation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A new computer model is developed and used to calculate the deposition of inhaled heterodispersed hygroscopic aerosols for mouth breathing in a Weibel symmetric bronchial tree. The model was first validated by obtaining good agreement with recent experimental and theoretical data on regional and total airway deposition of monodispersed and heterodispersed nonhygroscopic aerosols. The model was then used to obtain predictions of regional and total deposition of heterodispersed hygroscopic aerosol particles (droplets of NaCl solutions). Parameters that were varied in the hygroscopic calculations include initial droplet NaCl concentration, time of inspiration and expiration, volume of aerosol inspired, period of breath holding, and initial inhaled lognormal aerosol mass median diameter and geometric standard deviation. Results of the computer calculations show that increasing heterodispersity tends to flatten and broaden regional deposition curves when fraction of inhaled mass deposited is plotted vs. inhaled mass median aerodynamic particle diameter. Hygroscopicity is shown to increase tracheobronchial and pulmonary airway deposition with hypertonic NaCl solution aerosols showing increases over isotonic and nonhygroscopic aerosols of up to 200%.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Maximization of pulmonary hygroscopic aerosol deposition.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A newly developed computer model is used to predict the aqueous salt solution concentration, breathing pattern, and inhaled droplet size distribution parameters that will maximize pulmonary deposition of hygroscopic medicinal aerosols. The parameter values providing maximum pulmonary deposition include 1) a NaCl concentration in the aerosolized solution of 0.035 g/ml or higher if the subject can tolerate it, 2) as nearly a monodispersed inhaled aerosol size distribution as possible, 3) an aerosol mass median diameter of 2-3 micron, and 4) slow (7 breaths/min) uninterrupted breathing of 1.5-2 liters of aerosol/breath. With these values, the model predicts that pulmonary deposition can be increased by greater than 100% relative to the deposition achieved in conventional inhalation therapy with isotonic saline-based medications.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cooling different body surfaces during upper and lower body exercise.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of varying the body surface area being cooled by a liquid microclimate system was evaluated during exercise heat-stress conditions. Six male subjects performed a total of six exercise (O2 uptake = 1.2 l/min) tests in a hot environment (ambient temperature = 38 degrees C, relative humidity = 30%) while dressed in clothing having low moisture permeability and high insulation. Each subject completed two upper body exercise (U; arm crank) tests: 1) with only the torso surface (T) cooled; and 2) with the surfaces of both the torso and upper arms (TA) cooled [coolant temperature at the inlet (Ti) was 20 degrees C for all upper body tests]. Each subject also completed four lower body exercise (L; walking) tests: 1) with only the T cooled (Ti = 20 degrees C); 2) with only the T cooled (Ti = 26 degrees C); 3) with torso, upper arm, and thigh surface (TAT) cooled (Ti = 20 degrees C); and 4) with TAT cooled (Ti = 26 degrees C). During U exercise, TA cooling had no effects compared with cooling only T. During L exercise, sweat rates, heart rates, and rectal temperature (Tre) changes were less with TAT cooling compared with cooling only the T. Altering Ti had no effect on Tre changes, but higher heart rates were observed with 26 than with 20 degrees C. These data indicate that cooling arms during upper body exercise provides no thermoregulatory advantage, although cooling the thigh surfaces during lower body exercise does provide an advantage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cardiovascular responses to military antishock trouser inflation during standing arm exercise.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Military antishock trousers (MAST) inflated to 50 mmHg were used with 12 healthy males (mean age 28 +/- 1 yr) to determine the effects of lower-body positive pressure on cardiac output (Q), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and O2 uptake (VO2) during graded arm-cranking exercise. Subjects were studied while standing at rest and at 25, 50, and 75% of maximal arm-cranking VO2. At each level, rest or work was continued for 6 min with MAST inflated and for 6 min with MAST deflated. Order of inflation and deflation was alternated at each experimental rest or exercise level. Measurements were obtained during the last 2 min at each level. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant increases (P less than 0.001) in Q, SV, and MABP and a consistent decrease in HR with MAST inflation. There was no apparent change in Q/VO2 between inflated and control conditions. There was no effect of MAST inflation on VO2 or TPR. MAST inflation counteracts the gravitational effect of venous return in upright exercise, restoring central blood volume and thereby increasing Q and MABP from control. HR is decreased consequent to increased MABP through arterial baroreflexes. The associated decrease in TPR is not observed, being offset by the mechanical compression of leg vasculature with MAST inflation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of aerobic training on forced expiratory airflow in exercising asthmatic humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pulmonary function after exercise was evaluated in 22 asthmatic subjects before and after a 36-session training sequence of aerobic exercise. Training did not change pulmonary function values, except for a small increase in maximal voluntary ventilation (P less than 0.02), which was attributed to respiratory muscle training. After aerobic training, both external work at a given heart rate and peak O2 consumption increased by 30 and 15%, respectively. At the same minute ventilation (VE), immediate postexercise forced expiratory airflow was higher after training (P less than 0.02), and reduction in forced expiratory airflow during the first 9 min postexercise was less after training (P less than 0.01). The posttraining airflow response to the pretraining work load was, as expected, less than the pretraining response (P less than 0.02). Although the difference in maximal-to-minimal airflow at the same VE was similar before and after training, the airflow increase accounted for 50% of the response after training compared with 16% of the pretraining response. Furthermore the strong negative correlation (P less than 0.01) between maximal and minimal airflow both pre- and posttraining indicates that exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) severity is, in part, determined by the degree of exercise-induced bronchodilation. We conclude that aerobic training significantly increases exercise-induced bronchodilation and diminishes EIB.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Relationship between distance running mechanics, running economy, and performance.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relationships between biocmechanical aspects of distance running, running economy (VO2 submax), and performance were investigated. A variety of biomechanical measures for 31 subjects running at 3.6 m/s was obtained, including three-dimensional angular and translational kinematics, ground reaction forces and center of pressure patterns, mechanical power, and anthropometric measures. Physiological measures obtained included maximal and submaximal O2 consumption, muscle fiber composition, and measures of the ability to store and return elastic energy during knee bends. A subset of 16 runners was also evaluated in relation to performance in a 10-km run. Biomechanical variables were identified which showed significant differences or consistent trends between groups separated on the basis of VO2 submax, establishing the importance of biomechanical influences on running economy. It appears that no single variable or small subset of variables can explain differences in economy between individuals but rather that economy is related to a weighted sum of the influences of many variables.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of hyperthermia and hypothermia on oxygen extraction by tissues during hypovolemia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- As systemic delivery of O2 (QO2 = QT X CaO2) is reduced during progressive hemorrhage, the O2 extraction ratio [(CaO2 - CVO2)/CaO2] increases until a critical delivery is reached below which O2 uptake (VO2) becomes limited by delivery (O2 supply dependence). When tissue metabolic activity and O2 demand are increased or reduced, the critical QO2 required to maintain VO2 should rise or fall accordingly, unless other changes in the distribution of a limited QO2 precipitate the onset of O2 supply dependence at a different critical extraction ratio. We compared the critical QO2 and critical extraction ratio in 23 normothermic (38 degrees C), hyperthermic (41 degrees C), or hypothermic (34 decrees C) dogs during stepwise reduction in delivery produced by bleeding, as arterial O2 content was maintained. Dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. Hypothermia reduced whole-body VO2 by 31%, whereas hyperthermia increased VO2 by 20%. The critical QO2 was significantly reduced during hypothermia (5.6 +/- 0.95 ml.min-1.kg-1) (P less than 0.05) and increased during hyperthermia (8.9 +/- 1.1) (P approximately equal to 0.06) compared with normothermic controls (7.4 +/- 1.2). The extraction ratio at the onset of supply dependency was significantly increased in hyperthermia (0.76 +/- 0.05) compared with hypothermia (0.65 +/- 0.10) (P less than 0.05), and the normothermic critical extraction was 0.71 +/- 0.1. These results suggest that higher body temperatures are associated with an improved ability to maintain a VO2 independent of QO2, since a higher fraction of the delivered O2 can be extracted before the onset of O2 supply dependence, relative to lower body temperatures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regional differences in neutrophil margination in dog lungs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We investigated the relationship between polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) retention and erythrocyte (RBC) velocity in the lungs of mongrel dogs. Regional velocity was estimated by measuring regional RBC transit times and was correlated with the retention of PMN found in the same lung sample 10 min after the injection of a bolus of labeled cells. Data from the whole lung showed that the total number of cells marginated in the pulmonary vasculature was 2.4 times as great as the number present in the circulation and that this pool turned over at a rate of 1%/s. The regional data showed increased retention, indicating slower PMN turnover in the upper lung regions, which have longer transit times and therefore slower blood velocities than the RBC is attributed to a greater discrepancy between PMN and RBC is attributed to a greater discrepancy between PMN and capillary size and the fact that PMN are less deformable than RBC. The large number of capillary segments present in the lung allows neutrophils to move more slowly while RBC stream around them. We conclude that there are approximately 2.5 times as many PMNs marginated in the lung as there are in the total circulating blood volume of the dog and that the pulmonary marginated pool turns over at approximately 1%/s with slower turnover in the upper compared with the lower regions of the lung.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Estimation of amount of stationary pulmonary blood from carbon monoxide uptake measurements.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A mathematical model of CO uptake from a single alveolus is modified to include stationary pulmonary blood arising from a pulmonary vascular obstruction. From this model an estimator model is developed that produces simultaneous estimations of the diffusing capacity of the lung for CO and the fraction of the pulmonary capillary blood that is stationary. The estimator model was tested using simulated data from uniform and non-uniform simulators and found to be only mildly sensitive to noise and incorrect values for the pulmonary capillary blood volume. Both the estimator model and breath-to-breath changes in the diffusing capacity of the lung for CO (exhaled) were found to be greatly affected by inhomogeneity of diffusing capacity and ventilation. At times both returned false positive results that limit their use as a screening test for stationary pulmonary blood. Although changes in CO uptake may at times indicate the presence of stationary pulmonary blood, the confounding effects of inhomogeneity of ventilation and diffusing capacity make the use of such changes impractical under most circumstances.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pulmonary edema with smoke inhalation, undetected by indicator-dilution technique.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite experimental evidence for an increase in extravascular lung water (EVLW) after inhalation injury, thermal-dye estimations of EVLW, extravascular thermal volume (EVTV), have repeatedly failed to demonstrate its presence in patients. This situation was evaluated in a sheep model. Under halothane anesthesia one lung was insufflated with cotton smoke and the other with air. EVTV values were 8.4 +/- 0.48 ml/kg at base line and were not elevated at 24 h after smoke inhalation (8.3 +/- 0.45 ml/kg; means +/- SE). Gravimetric analysis 24 h after smoke inhalation showed the development of edema in smoke-exposed lungs. The blood-free wet weight-to-dry weight ratio of the smoke-exposed lungs (5.4 +/- 0.32) was significantly higher compared with the contralateral unsmoked lungs (4.3 +/- 0.15; P less than or equal to 0.05). The thermal-dye technique thus underestimates EVLW. Poor perfusion of the smoke-exposed lungs 24 h after injury was demonstrated indirectly by killing a group of sheep with T-61, an agent that causes a dark red coloration of well-perfused lung areas, as well as directly by measurement of blood flow utilizing a radiolabeled microsphere technique. Thus the inability of the thermal-dye technique to detect the lung edema may be the result of poor perfusion of the injured lung.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Possible sensory receptor of nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine the sensory receptor of the nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system (NAIS), 22 cats were anesthetized and serotonin was continuously administered (50-250 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv) to increase pulmonary resistance (RL) to 377 +/- 57% (SE) of the control value. We then 1) mechanically irritated the trachea, 2) intravenously administered capsaicin (5 micrograms/kg), or 3) induced hypoxia (arterial PO2 30-40 Torr) to stimulate irritant and bronchial C-fiber receptors, pulmonary C-fiber receptors, or the carotid body (chemoreceptors), respectively. After treatment with atropine (3 mg/kg iv) and propranolol (2 mg/kg iv), the serotonin-induced change in RL was reduced by 58.6 +/- 14.3% by mechanical irritation and 63.3 +/- 12.1% by intravenous capsaicin. However, hypoxia produced no dilatation of the airways. In further experiments, we employed capsaicin inhalation to stimulate bronchial C-fiber receptors. Inhaled capsaicin (0.1%, for 5 breaths) also reduced RL by 79.2 +/- 9.2% of the elevated value, after atropine and propranolol. Treatment with a ganglionic blocking agent, hexamethonium (2 mg/kg iv), abolished bronchodilator responses, implying that a reflex pathway through vagal nerves is involved in this phenomenon. These results suggest that pulmonary and bronchial C-fiber receptors may be involved as sensory receptors in NAIS reflex bronchodilatation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Thermoregulation during prolonged exercise in heat: alterations with beta-adrenergic blockade.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thermoregulation and cardiovascular drift were studied under conditions of prolonged exercise in a warm environment (dry bulb temperature 31.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C, rh 44.7 +/- 4.7%) during beta-adrenergic blockade. Fourteen subjects performed 90-min rides on a cycle ergometer at a work rate equivalent to 40% of their control maximal O2 uptake under each of three treatments provided in a randomized double-blind manner: atenolol (100 mg/day), propranolol (160 mg/day), and a placebo. Exercise during the propranolol trial resulted in significantly higher forearm vascular resistance values and significantly lower forearm blood flows (FBF) compared with the placebo trial. However, the significantly lower FBF during propranolol did not significantly alter the rectal temperature (Tre) response to prolonged exercise. In addition, both beta-blockers produced lower FBF for any given Tre, suggesting that beta-adrenergic blockade affects FBF through nonthermal factors. The slight differences in Tre, despite the large differences in FBF between the various treatments, are apparently the result of an enhanced sweat loss and a lower mean skin temperature during exercise with beta-blockade. The uncoupling of FBF and sweat loss provides evidence of independent regulation. The reduction in FBF at any given Tre was concomitant to lower blood pressure values during beta-blockade and suggests that baroreflexes provide significant input to the control of skin blood flow when both pressure and temperature maintenance are simultaneously challenged.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Body composition in adolescents: estimation by total body electrical conductivity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This comparative study, conducted on 28 boys and girls of widely varying fatness, was designed to validate a new whole-body composition method [total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC)], based on bioelectrical properties of the human body. A significant correlation [r = 0.911; standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 5.3 kg] was demonstrated between the transformed TOBEC scores (TOBEC0.5 X Ht) and lean body mass (LBM) determined by hydrodensitometry and corrected for individual variations in hydration (LBMd + W). TOBEC determinations also correlated well with 1) total body water determined by deuterium oxide dilution (r = 0.877; SEE = 4.5 liters), 2) total body potassium determined by means of a 4 pi whole-body counter (r = 0.860; SEE = 430.7 meq), 3) LBM derived from skinfold thicknesses (r = 0.850; SEE = 5.8 kg). The residuals of the regression between LBMd + W and TOBEC scores did not show any significant correlation with either the potassium or the water content of the LBM. The results indicate that TOBEC is a simple, rapid, reliable, and noninvasive technique for delineating changes in body composition that occur in children during growth.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A model of the respiratory pump.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The interaction of forces that produce chest wall motion and lung volume change is complex and incompletely understood. To aid understanding we have developed a simple model that allows prediction of the effect on chest wall motion of changes in applied forces. The model is a lever system on which the forces generated actively by the respiratory muscles and passively by impedances of rib cage, lungs, abdomen, and diaphragm act at fixed sites. A change in forces results in translational and/or rotational motion of the lever; motion represents volume change. The distribution and magnitude of passive relative to active forces determine the locus and degree of rotation and therefore the effect of an applied force on motion of the chest wall, allowing the interaction of diaphragm, rib cage, and abdomen to be modeled. Analysis of moments allow equations to be derived that express the effect on chest wall motion of the active component in terms of the passive components. These equations may be used to test the model by comparing predicted with empirical behavior. The model is simple, appears valid for a variety of respiratory maneuvers, is useful in interpreting relative motion of rib cage and abdomen and may be useful in quantifying the effective forces acting on the rib cage.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Blood flow was measured in leg and torso skin of conscious or anesthetized sheep by using 15-micron radioactive microspheres (Qm) and the 133Xe washout method (QXe). There was a good relationship between Qm in the cutaneous compartment and QXe calculated from the fast component of the biexponential washout curves (QXe = 0.40.Qm + 6.2, r = 0.90, P less than 0.001) with QXe values substantially below those determined with microspheres. Only at low blood flow levels was there a tendency for QXe to overestimate capillary blood flow as assessed with microspheres, but at higher blood flow levels the 133Xe washout method resulted in values substantially below those determined with microspheres. The slope of the slow component of the washout curves was inversely related to the tissue-blood partition coefficient in the subcutaneous tissue (r = 0.52, P less than 0.001), indicating an influence of the amount of subcutaneous fat on the washout rate. QXe calculated from the slow component of the washout curves was not significantly correlated with Qm in the subcutaneous compartment (r = 0.19, P greater than 0.10). In leg skin with dilated arteriovenous anastomoses, QXe was generally higher than in torso skin and leg skin with constricted arteriovenous anastomoses, indicating that shunt blood flow increases the washout of 133Xe.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gastrointestinal transit during mild exercise.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although exercise is often recommended as therapy for constipation, almost nothing is known of the effects of exercise on rates of movement of material in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study we investigated the influence of mild exercise on transit of a liquid meal from the mouth to the large intestine. Orocecal transit time was determined by a consistent elevation of H2 concentration in a rebreathing apparatus after ingestion of 30 g lactulose; the lactulose was part of a 360-kcal, 350-ml liquid meal. Comparison of transit time was made, in 12 young healthy subjects, between seated rest and a treadmill walk at 5.6 km/h up a 2% grade. The walk elevated heart rate from 64 +/- 4 to 109 +/- 5 beats/min, O2 uptake (VO2) from 0.29 +/- 0.02 to 1.20 +/- 0.07 l/min STPD, and final rectal temperature from 37.0 +/- 0.1 to 38.3 +/- 0.1 degrees C (all P less than 0.01). Exercise speeded transit of the liquid meal, with mean rises in H2 concentration taking place 66 +/- 10 min after ingestion at rest, compared with 44 +/- 6 min after food intake during exercise (P less than 0.02). H2 concentrations in the rebreathing apparatus showed similar base lines in the two experiments, and quantitative increases in H2 concentration, although shifted in time by exercise, were otherwise identical. Subjects with the slowest resting transit rates showed the largest exercise effects (r = 0.79, P less than 0.05). These results indicate that mouth-to-cecum transit of at least the first portion of a liquid meal-based nonabsorbable carbohydrate marker is significantly accelerated during mild exercise.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hypoxia-induced alterations of norepinephrine vascular reactivity in isolated perfused cat lung.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Past work in the isolated perfused cat lung has shown that acute hypoxia (H) changes the response to norepinephrine (NE) from vasoconstriction to vasodilation but has no effect on the response to serotonin (S). These results could be related to the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure or vascular resistance during the hypoxic pressor response or a direct effect of H. We addressed this question, in the same preparation, by comparing responses to NE under four conditions in each experimental animal (n = 12): 1) NE infused during normoxia; 2) NE infused after vascular resistance (Rpv) was increased with serotonin; 3) NE infused after Rpv was increased by H; 4) NE infused after lobar pressure was raised by an increase in flow (P/F). PO2 values during H were varied (27-56 Torr). S and H produced a 137 +/- 35 and 43 +/- 8% delta Rpv increase in lobar vascular resistance, respectively. P/F increased lobar pressure 91 +/- 10%. Only NE infusion during H demonstrated significant differences in lobar pressure and Rpv compared with control normoxic periods. There was no correlation between responses to NE during S, H, and P/F and degree to which each stimulus increased Rpv or lobar pressure (r = 0.003, 0.28, 0.24). A significant relationship between response to NE during H vs. PO2 during H was observed (r = 0.78; P less than 0.001). In a subset of animals, we repeated the infusion of NE during H and P/F post-beta-blockade. The decrease in vascular response to NE during H and the correlation of PO2 with NE response were abolished (n = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chemical control of tracheal vascular resistance in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- With anesthetized dogs we have measured upper tracheal vascular resistance on both sides of the trachea simultaneously by perfusing the cranial tracheal arteries and measuring inflow pressures at constant flows. The ratio of pressure to flow gave vascular resistance (Rtv). Lung airflow, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and pressure in a cervical tracheal balloon (Ptr) were also measured. In paralyzed dogs, systemic hypoxia due to artificial ventilation with 10% O2-90% N2 increased Rtv by +8.1 +/- 1.0% (SE), Ptr by +76 +/- 22.8%, and BP by +18.9 +/- 24%. After bilateral cervical vagosympathectomy the increases in Rtv and BP were present (+8.8 +/- 0.9 and +22.3 +/- 0.3%, respectively). After carotid body denervation Rtv, Ptr, and BP increased (+6.4 +/- 1.3, +58.6 +/- 31.6, and +14.6 +/- 3.3%, respectively). After vagotomy Rtv and BP increased (+14.1 +/- 1.7 and +22.4 +/- 10.1%, respectively). Tracheal perfusion with hypoxic blood caused a small vasodilation (-2.2 +/- 1.1%). Systemic hypercapnia due to artificial ventilation with 8% CO2-92% air increased Rtv by +16.7 +/- 3.8%, Ptr by +67 +/- 2.0%, and BP by +12.9 +/- 9.9%. Tracheal perfusion with hypercapnic blood caused a small vasodilation (-2.5 +/- 1.2%). Stimulation of the carotid body chemoreceptors with KCN caused a small increase in Rtv (+1.2 +/- 0.5%) and increases in Ptr (+49.8 +/- 13.6%) and BP (+11.1 +/- 2.1%). Systemic hypoxia and hypercapnia caused tracheal vasoconstriction mainly by an action on the central nervous system.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ozone exposure alters tracheobronchial mucociliary function in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Mucociliary function is a primary defense mechanism of the tracheobronchial airways, and yet the response of this system to an inhalational hazard, such as ozone, is undefined in humans. Utilizing noninvasive techniques to measure deposition and retention of insoluble radiolabeled particles on airway mucous membranes, we studied the effect on mucus transport of 0.2 and 0.4 ppm ozone compared with filtered air (FA) in seven healthy males. During 2-h chamber exposures, subjects alternated between periods of rest and light exercise with hourly spirometric measurement of lung function. Mechanical and mucociliary function responses to ozone by lung airways appeared concentration dependent. Reduction in particle retention was significant (P less than 0.005) (i.e., transport of lung mucus was increased during exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone and was coincident with impaired lung function; e.g., forced vital capacity and midmaximal flow rate fell by 12 and 16%, respectively, and forced expiratory volume at 1 s by 5%, of preexposure values). Regional analysis indicated that mucus flow from distal airways into central bronchi was significantly increased (P less than 0.025) by 0.2 ppm ozone. This peripheral effect, however, was buffered by only a marginal influence of 0.2 ppm ozone on larger bronchi, such that the resultant mucus transport for all airways of the lung in aggregate differed only slightly from FA exposures. These data may reflect differences in regional diffusion of ozone along the respiratory tract, rather than tissue sensitivity. In conclusion, mucociliary function of humans is acutely stimulated by ozone and may result from fluid additions to the mucus layer from mucosal and submucosal secretory cells and/or alteration of epithelial permeability.</ABSTRACT>

- Forty-nine patients who had a complete tear and forty-one who had a partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament were examined as regards long-term healing. All had had a positive clinical diagnosis just after the injury, which was confirmed in the majority under anesthesia, at arthrotomy, on arthroscopy, or with a combination of these methods. The re-examination was performed an average of eight years after the injury. Besides a functional and objective evaluation, radiographic examination and evaluations of isokinetic and isometric strength were made. The multidimensional analysis revealed that in an unselected population the long-term results of the complete tears were poor, because of chronic instability. In many, reconstructive operations were needed, and post-traumatic arthritis was common. In the patients who had a partial tear, the results were quite good even if the stability of the knees had not improved when compared with the initial post-traumatic status. Conservative treatment of complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament cannot be recommended as a treatment of choice, whereas partial tears can be treated by non-operative methods.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Resection arthroplasty as a salvage procedure for a knee with infection after a total arthroplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1970 and 1983, resection arthroplasty was done as a salvage procedure for twenty-eight knees (twenty-six patients) with infection after total arthroplasty. Eleven patients had multiarticular rheumatoid arthritis; fourteen, osteoarthritis; and one, multiarticular neuropathic arthropathy. Systemic signs of infection were eliminated in all patients and local signs, in 89 per cent of the patients. After resection arthroplasty alone, fifteen patients were able to walk independently. Six patients with monoarticular osteoarthritis who found the resection arthroplasty to be unacceptable had a successful secondary arthrodesis. In three patients a spontaneous bone fusion developed after the resection, with the knee in a good position. Two patients who were unable to walk before the resection arthroplasty were still unable to do so postoperatively. Neither the patient's disease nor the type of prosthesis that had been used was a reliable predictor of success of the resection arthroplasty. The patients who had had the most severe disability before the total knee arthroplasty were most likely to be satisfied. Patients who had had less disability were more likely to find the results of resection arthroplasty to be unsatisfactory.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Anatomy of the abductor muscles of the hip as studied by computed tomography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Computed tomography provides a non-invasive method for studying anatomy in live subjects. The abductor muscles of the hip were studied by using computed tomography to describe their position, size, and orientation. The outlines of the muscles were clearly identifiable; patterns that are associated with trauma, arthritis, and so on, differed from normal. The patterns in eighteen normal hips in twelve adults were mapped in detail. The cross-sectional areas of the abductor muscles were measured and vectors representing the total pull of the abductor muscle in the frontal and sagittal planes were constructed for each hip. The variations in individual and composite muscular anatomy were recorded. The inclination of the axis of the abductor muscle ranged from 17 to 26 degrees (standard deviation, 2.9 degrees) in the frontal plane and from -2 to 14 degrees (standard deviation, 4.2 degrees) in the sagittal plane.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Subtrochanteric fracture of the femur. Fixation using the Zickel nail [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1988 Jan;70(1):152]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We divided 131 patients who had a subtrochanteric fracture into four clinical groups: elderly patients who had a fracture secondary to minor trauma, patients who had a fracture due to high-energy trauma, those who had a pathological fracture, and patients who had a fracture that previously had been treated unsuccessfully with internal fixation. In each patient operative fixation was performed using the Zickel device, and overall satisfactory results were obtained in 90 per cent. Considering the challenging nature of subtrochanteric fractures, complications, which included a rate of non-union of approximately 5 per cent, were minimum. Technical details for each of the four groups are emphasized.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Isokinetic strength of the shoulder after repair of a torn rotator cuff.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The strength of the shoulder was measured isokinetically in forty patients who had undergone surgical repair of a torn rotator cuff. Thirty-three patients were tested six months postoperatively and twenty-four, after a year. There was an increase in strength between the two intervals (p less than 0.05) for abduction measured at 180 degrees per second, external rotation measured at 60 and 180 degrees per second, and flexion measured at 60 degrees per second. On the average, strength reached 80 per cent of normal in abduction and 90 per cent of normal in external rotation at one year postoperatively. Strength of forward flexion reached 75 per cent of normal. In seventeen patients with paired data (recorded at both six and twelve months), an increase in strength (p less than 0.05) was found for each motion and speed that was tested. Patients who had a small tear scored higher than those who had a large tear, but not to a significant degree. Whether the operation was done on the dominant extremity or on the non-dominant one did not appear to affect the results, nor did the timing of the repair after injury.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint. An end-result study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The cases of 127 patients who had an acute dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint were studied. Fifty-two patients, with an average follow-up of 10.8 years, were managed operatively, and seventy-five patients, with an average follow-up of 9.5 years, were managed non-operatively. Using a rating system that included subjective, objective, and roentgenographic criteria, it did not appear that reduction of the acromioclavicular joint was necessary to obtain consistently good results. Operative management, using either coracoclavicular or acromioclavicular fixation, was associated with a higher rate of complications than non-operative treatment. The use of a sling for four weeks without reduction of the joint, followed by a graduated exercise program, led to acceptable clinical results. In patients who had persistent pain and stiffness of the acromioclavicular joint, or in whom symptomatic post-traumatic arthritis developed, resection of the distal part of the clavicle reliably produced significant improvement.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The optimum position of arthrodesis of the ankle. A gait study of the knee and ankle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Findings from biomechanical analyses of gait were used to estimate the optimum position of arthrodesis of the ankle. Nineteen patients who were followed for an average of 10.4 years (range, four to seventeen years) were studied. By including the knee in the analysis as well as studying the effects on gait of different ground conditions, objective data for the weight-bearing extremities in the transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes were generated. Genu recurvatum was shown to be associated with a plantar-flexion position of fusion of the ankle. Laxity of the medial collateral ligament of the knee was noted in twelve patients (63 per cent). Among these patients, in three (16 per cent) the laxity was graded as moderate to severe, possibly due to external rotation of the extremity during gait to avoid rolling over the rigid plantar-flexed ankle. The patterns of gait showed that a valgus position of the arthrodesis is more advantageous and provides more normal gait, particularly on uneven ground. To attain more normal function of the knee and improve performance on rough ground, the optimum position of arthrodesis of the ankle appears to be neutral flexion, slight (zero to 5 degrees) valgus angulation, and approximately 5 to 10 degrees of external rotation. Posterior displacement of the talus under the tibia tends to produce a more normal pattern of gait and decreases the stress at the knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study has shown the ideal position of fusion of the ankle to be neutral flexion, slight (zero to 5 degrees) valgus angulation of the hind part of the foot, and 5 to 10 degrees of external rotation. This position allows the greatest compensatory motion at the foot and places the least strain on the knee.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of antibiotics on the destruction of cartilage in experimental infectious arthritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In joints with bacterial arthritis, continuing prolonged destruction of cartilage may occur in spite of prompt, effective antibiotic therapy. We measured the extent to which early antibiotic therapy with ceforanide altered the degradation of the cartilage after arthritis due to Staphylococcus aureus had been produced in the knee joint in rabbits. Degradation of the cartilage was quantified by analyses for glycosaminoglycan and collagen. Three weeks after the infection was produced, the cartilage had lost more than half of its glycosaminoglycan whether the antibiotic therapy had been started at one, two, or seven days after infection. Beginning the antibiotic treatment one day after infection reduced over-all loss of collagen by 37 per cent and decreased the area of erosion of the infected articular surfaces. When antibiotic treatment was begun at four, eight, or twelve hours after infection, the loss of glycosaminoglycan averaged 18 per cent. Prophylaxis with antibiotics completely prevented any degradation of the cartilage. Clinical relevance: The findings reported here show how rapidly cartilage loses glycosaminoglycan when it is involved by arthritis caused by staphylococci and how early treatment of the infection reduces the loss of collagen. There is less protection against loss of glycosaminoglycan. The results emphasize the need for early diagnosis and treatment of infectious synovitis and support the rationale for early administration of antibiotics without waiting for identification of the responsible bacteria.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Pyogenic osteomyelitis rarely affects the first and second cervical vertebrae, and when it does it can progress to abscess formation, compressing the spinal cord. If the process is unrecognized, it can be fatal. The cases of five patients are reported. Two patients were treated by anterior debridement and posterior cervical-occipital arthrodesis; one, by transoral drainage; one, by posterior cervical-occipital arthrodesis; and the fifth, by posterior atlanto-axial arthrodesis. The causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus in four patients and Pasteurella multocida in one. In all patients, intravenous antibiotics were used, followed by prolonged administration of oral antibiotics. All five patients recovered.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgical margins for soft-tissue sarcoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective analysis was done of the rates of local recurrence in eighty-one patients in whom soft-tissue sarcomas in the extremities and the trunk were treated by surgery only. The minimum length of follow-up was six years or until death. The surgical margin was wide in all patients according to the definition of the surgical staging system of Enneking et al., but we defined three types of wide margin. None of them included a whole anatomical compartment, so that the radical resection, as defined by the surgical staging system, was excluded from the study. The crude rates of local recurrence in the three subgroups that were studied differed significantly. There was no correlation between the rate of local recurrence and the histological grade of malignancy. Our findings suggest that the subclassification of the wide margin that we have applied to the surgical staging system of Enneking et al. is of value. The low rates of recurrence (less than 10 per cent) for subcutaneous lesions, and intramuscular lesions that were treated by primary myectomy, were comparable with those of radical resections and usually were followed by minor loss of function. The higher rate of recurrence (30 per cent) for the third subgroup, which included deep tumors that were not treated by myectomy, was comparable with the rates found in other studies.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The outcome in eleven patients in whom Grade-III and IV spondylolisthesis was treated non-operatively (Group I) was compared with that in twenty-one patients in whom the same degrees of spondylolisthesis were treated by posterior interlaminar fusion (Group II). At an average eighteen-year follow-up of the eleven patients in Group I, four (36 per cent) were asymptomatic, six (55 per cent) had mild symptoms, and only one had significant symptoms. Five (45 per cent) had one or more neurological findings, but none were incontinent. All of the patients in this group led an active life, and all had required only minor adjustments in their life-style. At an average twenty-four-year follow-up of the twenty-one patients in Group II, twelve (57 per cent) were asymptomatic, eight (38 per cent) had mild symptoms, and only one had significant symptoms. Nine (50 per cent) of the eighteen patients who had a physical examination had one or more neurological findings. Roentgenographically demonstrated failure of fusion did not adversely affect the results, and the patients remained asymptomatic despite the development of pseudarthrosis in one patient and bending of the fusion mass in three (14 per cent). In situ arthrodesis provides acceptable results for the patient who has Grade-III or IV spondylolisthesis and pain that interferes with life-style and that is unresponsive to non-operative treatment. In the skeletally immature patient, in situ fusion is recommended for disturbances of gait secondary to tight hamstrings and when the spondylolisthesis progresses.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Synovectomy of the rheumatoid knee using intra-articular injection of dysprosium-165-ferric hydroxide macroaggregates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred and eleven patients who had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and persistent synovitis of the knee were treated with intra-articular injection of 270 millicuries of dysprosium-165 bound to ferric hydroxide macroaggregates. A two-year follow-up was available for fifty-nine of the treated knees. Thirty-nine had a good result; nine, a fair result; and eleven, a poor result. Of the twenty-five knees that had Stage-I radiographic changes, nineteen had a good result. Of the thirty-four knees that had Stage-II radiographic changes, twenty showed a good result. Systemic spread of the radioactivity from the injected joint was minimum. The mean whole-body dose was calculated to be 0.3 rad and that to the liver twenty-four hours after injection, 3.2 rads. The results indicated that dysprosium-165-ferric hydroxide macroaggregate is an effective agent for performing radiation synovectomy, particularly in knees that have Stage-I radiographic changes. Because of the minimum rate of systemic spread of the dysprosium-165, it offers a definite advantage over agents that previously have been used.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- An evolutionary perspective of the knee.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The complex asymmetrical design of the human knee is ancient in origin. The distinctive characteristics of this design were well established more than 300 million years ago. The knees of most classes of tetrapods exhibit similar morphological characteristics, including a bicondylar cam-shaped distal part of the femur, intra-articular ligaments, menisci, and asymmetrical collateral ligaments. The functional characteristics are also similar, with the dynamic point of femorotibial contact moving posteriorly on the tibia in flexion, approximating a four-bar linkage system. The common design and function among knees of tetrapods imply a profound underlying similarity of kinematic principles. Despite the over-all similarity of the design of knees in tetrapods, no ideal animal model exists for the human knee. The human is the only known species that is both plantigrade and biped. By taking into account the retained complex asymmetry of motion of the human knee, such as the differentially greater femoral rollback of the lateral compartment as compared with the medial compartment, external bracing systems and designs for total knee replacement might be improved.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Arthroplasty of the basal joint of the thumb using a silicone prosthesis. Long-term follow-up.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-three hands were followed for an average of 7.8 years after arthroplasty of the basal joint of the thumb using a silicone prosthesis. The minimum length of follow-up was 5.6 years. All of the patients had relief of pain, but three complained of weakness. Radiographs of twenty hands showed that four prostheses had subluxated, three had dislocated, and thirteen had evidence of wear. Ten hands had destructive changes in the adjacent bones. We now recommend the use of a silicone prosthesis for arthroplasty of the basal joint only in elderly patients or in patients who have a low level of functional activity. In younger or more active patients, interpositional arthroplasty using tendon is recommended.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Total wrist replacement using the modified Volz prosthesis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Eighteen total wrist arthroplasties in sixteen patients were done using the modified Volz prosthesis. The length of follow-up ranged from twenty-four to sixty-six months, with a mean of forty months. A 100-point scoring system was used to evaluate the outcome. Muscle imbalance developed in five wrists, the carpal component became loose in three wrists, and two prostheses dislocated. In five patients six arthroplasties (33 per cent) were considered to have failed because one reoperation or more was required for loosening of the components in two wrists, dislocation in two wrists, and muscle imbalance in two wrists. Of the remaining twelve arthroplasties (eleven patients) eight (45 per cent) had an excellent result; two (11 per cent), a good; and two (11 per cent), a poor result. The over-all rate of complications was 44 per cent. Patients who had significant preoperative deformity did poorly postoperatively. The surgeon should be prepared to perform other types of arthroplasty or an arthrodesis if the extensor tendons are structurally inadequate, as this may lead to progressive flexion deformity postoperatively.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Neuropsychiatric complications are commonly seen in major burn patients. Haloperidol is frequently used to treat severe psychopathic behavior. We have noted severe muscle rigidity-an extrapyramidal side effect of the agent-in a number of burn patients. Haloperidol causes a relative imbalance of dopaminergic and cholinergic neuronal activity in the basal ganglia with a relative increase in cholinergic activity being responsible for EPS. The burn patient may be more prone to extrapyramidal symptoms because of increased sensitivity of skeletal muscle neuromuscular junctions to acetylcholine after thermal injury.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Patient self-reports three months after sustaining a major burn.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- As survival rates of patients with major burns increase, it is becoming more important to study the course and quality of their recovery. Few studies of the recovery of these patients exist that use a prospective design and standardized measures. This paper describes a preliminary study of the self-reported health of patients three months after sustaining a major burn. An initial analysis was conducted on selected data gathered from 29 patients as part of a more comprehensive, prospective study of burn rehabilitation outcome. Measurements analyzed included the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Health-Specific Locus of Control Scale (HLC), and the total body surface area burned (TBSA). Findings showed that TBSA was related to the degree to which patients perceived they had control over their health, but few correlations were found between TBSA, and HLC scale, and the SIP scale. On the SIP, most patients reported few or no problems, but a significant minority reported major problems in one or more areas of their lives. The problems that were reported tended to cluster in the areas of vocation and emotional adjustment. These results suggest that patients with major burns should not be considered a homogeneous group with respect to rehabilitation outcome.</ABSTRACT>

- The literature investigating the psychosocial adjustment of burn survivors is limited and that addressing such adjustment in burned children is contradictory. Forty-two adults, burned in childhood, were assembled into burn severity cohorts and compared as to burn severity, intensity of stress, and extent of disfigurement and disability. The findings substantiated the hypothesis that the biologic variables of years since burn and severity would not explain psychosocial adjustment in adulthood; lower adjustment correlated with visible disfigurement and less peer support rather than with severity of burn.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Psychological regression and marital status: determinants in psychiatric management of burn victims.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Major burn trauma is ordinarily associated with psychological regression, which regularly assumes either an immature, dependent (childlike), or primitive (animal-like) form. Also, the severely burned patient is exquisitely responsive, both constructively and destructively, to behavioral nuances in his or her "significant other," typically, the spouse. Two variables, type of regression and marital status, provide an empirically derived rationale for the psychiatric treatment of behavioral problems affecting patient management, including especially (1) pain-related behavior, (2) intrusive reexperiencing of the trauma, (3) depletion/despair phenomena, and (4) problems related to scarring. Results are more favorable when regression is of the dependent type rather than primitive type. Treatment is enhanced when the partner in a committed relationship is included in the treatment program.</ABSTRACT>

- One of the most frequent concerns of convalescent burn patients is that of sexual functioning. Using the degree of agreement between current performance and ideal performance as a measure of satisfaction with current performance, we have found a sex-related difference in 54 postburn patients. Postburn sexual functioning in males appears to be excellent; no specific factors could be identified by which this could be improved. However, in female patients, a much less satisfactory level of postburn sexual functioning is evident, which appears to be strongly correlated with physical dysfunction and with body image.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We examined the prevalence of depression after burn injury in 139 adults treated at a major burn center. Interviews were held from one to eight years following the burn. Our subsample, taken from 882 patients treated over a six-year period, comprised all patients with 30% total body surface area burns and a random sample of those with burns of lesser severity. We considered 17 possible predictors of depression (including the severity and placement of the burn and the patient's age, educational background, medical history, employment status, income level, and emotional and psychiatric history). We found that it is the person, rather than the injury, that best predicts postburn depression. The factor most strongly linked with depression was a past history of emotional disturbance. However, after being burned, a significant number of even previously well-adjusted patients show clinical postburn depression.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A survey of attitudes of burn unit nurses.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The staff of a burn unit was surveyed concerning attitudes about their patients and the treatment procedure. Previous research indicates that in such medical settings paradoxical interactions (double binds) may occur among staff, patient, and family. We hypothesized that the paradoxical environment of burn care units facilitates individuals who can change their perspective (or reframe these situations) and that this ability is related to attitudes and feelings about burn patients and their treatment. Contrary to expectation, however, reframing ability and attitudes about burn care were not related. Staff members are quite positive about burn treatment and agree that the staff instills hope. The staff's endorsement of providing accurate information, while behaving optimistically even if pessimistic about the patient's condition, does represent possible double-binding communication patterns. Nursing managers with high reframing ability may facilitate staff coping with these issues.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Sustaining a burn injury is a devastating and painful experience. After acute concerns have been dealt with, continued support of the child and family is important in achieving a smooth return to normal activities. Reports from burned patients for whom physical therapy was a concern identified a need for physical therapy involvement in school reentry to facilitate a resumption of normal school routine. Physical therapy involvement in school reentry has been successful and rewarding with a reasonable commitment of manpower. Utilization of personnel in the administrative structure of state and local school systems promoted the acceptance of the program by local school personnel. Although this program is designed to meet the needs of burned children, the goals of the school reentry program may meet similar needs of children with other chronic illnesses.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prognostic factors in the surgical treatment of aorto-iliac aneurysmal disease. Factors affecting survival and long-term results.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Factors governing the immediate and long-term outcome of surgical treatment of aorto-iliac aneurysmal disease were investigated in 182 elective and 116 ruptured consecutive cases. There was a 3.3% operative mortality for elective procedures and a 46.6% mortality for ruptured aneurysms. Long-term survival of elective resections was significantly reduced by age (0.01 less than p less than 0.025) and concomitant heart disease (0.025 less than p less than 0.05). Compensated renal insufficiency and chronic obstructive pneumopathy were not enough individually to preclude elective resection. In the emergency procedures the correlation of pre-, per- and postoperative factors to mortality was assessed: patient age (p = 0.01) and preoperative duration of symptoms less than 6 hours (p = 0.0076), arterial hypotension at the outset, during and at the end of operation (p = 0.0195; 0.0076 and 0.005 respectively), blood loss (p = 0.003), suprarenal extension of aneurysm (p = 0.0098) and intraperitoneal hemorrhage (p = 0.0094) were significant predictive factors in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis peroperative duration of hypotension greater than 30 minutes was the strongest single independent discriminator (p = 0.0076), death being caused by myocardial ischemia in elderly patients, secondary to poorly tolerated severe hypovolemia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Aorto-enteric fistulas as postoperative complication.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This report is based on 15 own observations and 164 patients collected from the literature. The most frequent location both of primary and secondary aortic-enteric fistulas (AEF) is the end part of the duodenum (60-70%). In the group of secondary AEF the paraprosthetic type represents the most frequent morphological finding. The best diagnostic approach should be seen in a gastroduodenoscopy. The choice of surgical repair is still controversal. Most of the surgeons insist on a radical repair (Type A: restoration of the intestinal tract, complete removal of the vascular prosthesis, blind closure of the infrarenal aortic stump, axillo-bifemoral bypass). Type A repair is loaded with a high operative mortality (52%) and a number of secondary complications (e.g. recurrent AEF; bleeding from the aortic stump). As an alternative surgical approach the author present an in-situ-repair (Type B: closing of the intestinal defect, partial exchange of inserted vascular prosthesis, an encircling omentum sleeve covering the prosthesis and anastomoses). The Type B repair offers a time saving procedure with a reduced operative mortality (26%) and a better outcome for the patients. This method is only contraindicated in the presence of a spread infection of the retroperitoneal space including the vascular prosthesis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Preservation of compliance in a small diameter microporous, silicone rubber vascular prosthesis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Compliance is believed to be a significant factor in maintaining the patency of small diameter vascular grafts. This study evaluated the compliance changes with time of microporous Replamineform silicone rubber prostheses. The compliance of 15 canine femoral artery interpositions (4 mm internal diameter X 6 cm length) was measured by in-vivo electromagnetic rheoangiometry immediately following implantation and at intervals to eight months. At implantation, silicone rubber grafts were overcompliant (15.0 +/- 1.1% radial change/mmHg X 10(-2); mean +/- S.E.) compared to the proximal artery (7.7 +/- .6%). The compliance of the prostheses decreased within two weeks (6.3 +/- .9%) and remained isocompliant to the proximal artery for eight months. The compliance determinations for the silicone rubber grafts were compared with those from PTFE prostheses and vein grafts acquired by the same method in a previous study. The analysis demonstrates the preservation of isocompliance of the silicone rubber prostheses compared to the native arteries. In contrast, the minimally compliant vein grafts and PTFE prostheses continued to decrease in compliance following implantation. This microporous silicone rubber graft may improve the success of small internal diameter arterial reconstructions by eliminating failures caused by compliance mismatch between the artery and the prosthesis.</ABSTRACT>

- A woven, double velour Dacron vascular graft was made nonporous by coating it with a layer of collagen prepared from fresh, young calf skin. Grafts were implanted in the thoracic aorta of 24 mongrel dogs and were examined at intervals up to 180 days. The grafts did not require preclotting or special preparation before being implanted. They sutured easily and did not bleed. When explanted all grafts were patent and covered with neointima. The bovine collagen was almost completely resorbed by 90 days and was replaced with native tissue. The collagen was neither thrombogenic, antigenic, cytotoxic, or pyrogenic.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Renovascular hypertension in pediatric patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifteen pediatric patients (ages 5-17 years) with renovascular hypertension (RVH) are reported. The diagnosis was made by arteriogram in all patients as the intravenous pyelogram was not helpful in this group. Five patients had a coarctation of the abdominal aorta. Four of these had associated renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenosis alone was present in 14 patients, unilateral in 8, and bilateral in 6. Three of the former had a contralateral hypoplastic kidney. A nephrectomy was performed in 2 patients, both of whom continue to be hypertensive. Renal revascularization was performed in 13 patients; one of these died of sepsis. Eight are normotensive, 2 are improved (normotensive with diuretics), and 2 remain hypertensive. The follow-up is from 1 to 15 years.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Late arterial aneurysm proximal to corrected post-traumatic arteriovenous fistula.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 60 year-old man presented with an extensive iliofemoral aneurysm discovered 11 years after the closure of a long-standing (28 years) post-traumatic arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Treatment by exclusion and bypass was successful. Fifteen other such cases have been reported in the literature in the last 15 years. While cardiomegaly is reversible once the AVF has been closed, arteriomegaly continues to increase or may begin only after closure. The mechanism for this phenomenon is debated. All arterial dilatations discovered during or after closure of AVF must be treated because of the risk of rupture. Prevention implies early treatment of all AVF. If the AVF is long-standing, the caliber of the artery proximal to the site of repair must be carefully measured and all dilated segments replaced. The patient should be warned of the possibility of late arteriomegaly proximal to the site of closure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Assessment of a standard exercise test in peripheral arterial disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A recently proposed standard exercise procedure for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease has been tested in patients with unilateral intermittent claudication. The immediate post-exercise fall in systolic ankle pressure after a 1 minute walk at 4 km/h on a 10% slope has been compared with the results from the contralateral and control limbs. The test was acceptable to the patients and easy to perform but has not in this study proven sensitive enough, as described, to detect asymptomatic (but angiographically verified) arterial lesions. The test is found valuable, however, especially in patients with inconclusive resting pressure recordings i.e. with an ankle to brachial pressure index close to 0.9. A pressure drop of 30% or more in this group of patients seems to indicate functionally important arterial disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Carotid occlusive disease: an electrophysiological macular investigation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirteen patients with carotid stenosis were studied by the authors by the measuring the Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) before and after thromboendarterectomy. This test of retinal function measures the recovery time of the amplitude of the major positive peak (P100) after photostress. When compared to that we observed in controls, we found, a significant increase of the P100 recovery time in patients suffering from carotid disease with severe stenosis. The method proved suitable for the functional evaluation of the vascular reconstruction of the carotid area, since four weeks after surgery a physiological recovery of the amplitude of VEP was observed. This method is proposed by the authors for the long-term functional evaluation of patients subjected to carotid thromboendarterectomy for tight stenosis of the carotid bifurcation.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- An 18 year old girl suffering from a giant angiolipoma of back and chest wall with A-V malformation underwent total excision of the tumor in 4 stages. The first two stages included surgical ligation of the arterial blood supply to the tumor. In the third and fourth stages the tumor was resected with the use of an autotransfusion system. The last stage was complicated with massive bleeding and disseminated intravascular clotting. Control of bleeding was achieved by the use of autotransfusion system, right thoracotomy and massive transfusion of blood and its components. After long convalescence period associated with renal and respiratory failure the patient recovered completely without sequellae. This case demonstrates the complexity associated with the treatment of these rare tumors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of addition of magnesium to potassium-containing fluorocarbon cardioplegic preparations. An experimental study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of magnesium on potassium fluorocarbon cardioplegia was studied in 20 rabbits. Isolated hearts with ascending aortas were perfused with oxygenated and cooled (+4 degrees C) fluorocarbon solutions. In 10 experiments, the solution contained 20 mmol/l of potassium, in 10 further experiments, 20 mmol/l of potassium and 15 mmol/l of magnesium. Ultrastructural preservation of the myocardium was studied using transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the cation contents of the myocardium were studied by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (calcium, magnesium) or electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry (copper). After 120 minutes of ischaemia, areas of moderate or severe ultrastructural myocardial cell damage were observed in both groups but severe damage was more extensive and commoner in the group with no access to magnesium. Preservation of the capillary endothelium was also worse in that group. There was a highly significant increase in magnesium content, a decrease in calcium content and an increase in the magnesium/calcium ratio following magnesium-potassium fluorocarbon infusion. The copper content remained unchanged. A protective effect of magnesium was observed. The electrolyte content of cardioplegic solutions also alters the electrolyte content of the myocardium. This may be important in reperfusion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cold induced endothelial cell detachment in human saphenous vein grafts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of profound (4 degrees C) and moderate cooling (20 degrees C) on the endothelium of human saphenous vein grafts for aortocoronary bypass was studied. When harvesting the vein, a piece (5-6 cm) was taken for the study and divided in two equal parts. The segments were incubated in cell culture medium for 45 minutes at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C respectively. They were then perfused with cell culture medium at a flow rate of 100 ml/min, with a pressure of 85 mmHg and a temperature of 20 degrees C. After termination of perfusion the percentage of luminal surface without endothelial cells was determined by morphometry with scanning electron microscopy. The veins that were exposed to 4 degrees C had a significantly higher degree of endothelial cell detachment than those exposed to 20 degrees C (p less than 0.003). This study indicates that cooling to 4 degrees C may be harmful to the endothelial lining of veins which are prepared for grafting into the arterial system. Such cooling should therefore probably be avoided.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Between February 1982 and January 1984 27 St. Jude Medical cardiac valve prostheses were implanted in 24 children ranging in age from 5 to 20 years (mean 12.38 years). There were 10 isolated aortic valve replacements, 14 isolated mitral valve replacements and one triple valve replacement (aortic, mitral and tricuspid). There was one operative and four late deaths. All patients were maintained on Aspirin and Dipyridamole from the early postoperative period. There were six documented thromboembolic events occurring in five patients. There were 0.68 thromboembolic events per patient year in the aortic valve group and 0.19 events in the mitral valve group. Because of the significant incidence of thromboembolic events in our patients, we now recommend universal anticoagulation with Coumadin in all pediatric age patients in whom the St. Jude Medical prosthesis is implanted.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Clinical usefulness of plasma androstanediol glucuronide measurements in women with idiopathic hirsutism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Serum androstanediol glucuronide (3 alpha-diol G), a metabolite of the active androgens dihydrotestosterone and androstanediol, was elevated in 28 consecutive women with idiopathic hirsutism (IH). The mean 3 alpha-diol G level in the women with IH was 487 +/- 192 (+/- SD) ng/dL compared to 119 +/- 37 ng/dL in normal women (n = 50), and only 1 patient had a value overlapping with the normal range. Since 3 alpha-diol G appears to be formed entirely in target organs and has a long serum half-life, we studied its clinical usefulness by following women with IH during treatment. In 15 of 17 women with IH treated for 1-4 yr with glucocorticoids, contraceptives, or spironolactone, serum 3 alpha-diol G levels changed concordantly with clinical responses, in contrast to the poor concordance of serum testosterone (5 of 17), free testosterone (7 of 17), and androstenedione (7 of 17). Specifically, in IH patients treated with spironolactone, serum testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione levels changed little, yet clinical improvement frequently occurred, and this improvement was reflected by concomitantly lowered 3 alpha-diol G levels. Further, in 4 IH patients, discontinuation of effective therapy resulted in prompt increases in serum 3 alpha-diol G as harbingers of worsening hair growth. We, thus, conclude that serum 3 alpha-diol G measurements are clinically useful in evaluating hirsute women and correlate with the clinical responses to therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Characterization of serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I in active acromegaly with minimal elevation of serum GH.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In most patients with acromegaly basal serum GH concentrations are elevated and remain above 5 micrograms/L after oral glucose administration. In some patients, however, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations are elevated with only minimal elevations of serum GH. We studied the serum GH and IGF-I of two such patients to determine whether these peptide hormones are normal in this clinical situation. The serum GH of these patients was found to bind normally to receptors of the IM-9 lymphocyte. The elution pattern of IGF-I extracted from the patients' serum was similar to that of (Thr59) human IGF-I after passage through a Bio-Rad P-60 column in 0.5 M acetic acid. The IGF-I was further characterized by isoelectric focusing and C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The isoelectric points of the IGF-I components were similar to those of IGF-I in normal serum. The IGF-I in one patient had two components by HPLC, while that of the other patient had only one major component. The IGF-I components isolated by HPLC were normally active in stimulating [3H] alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by normal human fibroblasts. The elevated serum IGF-I concentrations of these two patients were GH dependent. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy in one patient resulted in a decline in serum IGF-I to a high normal concentration. Lowering the serum GH to subnormal concentrations by the administration of the somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 (Sandoz) restored normal IGF-I concentrations in the second patient. We conclude that the GH and IGF-I of these two patients cannot account for their apparent enhanced GH responsiveness.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Active transport of iodothyronines into human cultured fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thyroid hormone uptake into human cultured fibroblasts was studied using 2-min incubations with labeled iodothyronines. The results indicate the presence of an active T4 uptake process with two saturable sites with apparent Km values of 1.9 and 141 nM, respectively, and an active T3 uptake process with two saturable sites with Km values of 29 and 650 nM. The uptake of both hormones was energy dependent, i.e. inhibited by KCN or by incubation of the cells in the absence of glucose. By analogy with similar findings in rat hepatocytes we postulate that the high affinity systems represent active transport of thyroid hormone into the cell. Preincubation of the cells with 2 mM ouabain resulted in a decrease in the uptake of both T3 and T4, suggesting that a sodium gradient is necessary for transport. Similar to that in rat hepatocytes, uptake of T3 was inhibited by high concentrations of T4, and uptake of T4 was inhibited by high concentrations of T3. These data indicate that regulation of thyroid hormone uptake at the level of the plasma membrane may be operative in humans.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Toxic multinodular goiter: a variant of autoimmune hyperthyroidism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The aim of this study was to examine whether at least a subgroup of patients with toxic multinodular goiter may have autoimmune thyroid disease. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) activity, measured by a sensitive bioassay employing cultured human thyroid cells, was determined in patients with toxic multinodular goiter and other thyroid disorders. All patients with active Graves' disease (n = 47) had detectable serum TSI activity, whereas TSI was undetectable in patients with thyroid disease not believed to be of autoimmune origin: toxic adenoma (n = 13), cold nodule (n = 5), and nontoxic goiter (n = 19), with a single exception in the latter group. Toxic multinodular goiter (n = 26) was diagnosed based on clinical and laboratory evidence of hyperthyroidism associated with a multinodular goiter on palpation and scintiscan. The toxic multinodular goiter group was then subclassified according to scintiscan pattern (type A, diffuse but uneven distribution of technetium uptake; type B, multiple discrete nodules of varying size and function). All but 1 of the 11 TSI-positive toxic multinodular goiter patients had a type A scintiscan pattern. The patients with the type A scintiscan pattern were younger and more often had elevated antithyroid antibody titers, ophthalmopathy, and concurrent development of goiter and hyperthyroidism (rather than long-standing goiter preceding hyperthyroidism) compared to the type B patients. Thus, a subgroup of patients with clinically defined toxic multinodular goiter (type A) probably have autoimmune hyperthyroidism (a variant of Graves' disease), while in another subgroup (type B) hyperthyroidism is not related to an autoimmune etiology (a variant of toxic adenoma).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Human retroocular fibroblasts in vitro: a model for the study of Graves' ophthalmopathy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Orbital connective tissue and extraocular muscles are histologically abnormal in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO). Although extraocular muscles have been extensively studied as a target for autoimmune attack in the disease, no system has been available to study retroocular fibroblasts in GO. We developed a technique to isolate fibroblasts from minced explants of connective tissue removed in the course of transantral orbital decompression surgery for GO. Postmortem specimens from individuals without evidence of thyroid disease were obtained from the same anatomical site. Confluent cells could be passaged at least 10 times with stable morphology and frozen with greater than 75% viability. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to study the in vitro binding of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) to these cells. We found no difference in the degree of specific binding between GO cells and cells from normal individuals. However, there was significantly greater binding of IgG from GO sera than of that from normal serum to retroocular GO fibroblasts. These results suggest that serum IgG autoantibodies against normal retroocular fibroblasts are present in some GO patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Growth hormone treatment in short children: relationship between growth and serum insulin-like growth factor I and II levels.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-one children who were short but not GH deficient, whose serum GH responses to provocative tests were normal, and whose spontaneous GH secretion was low received daily sc injections of human GH (Crescormon; 0.1 IU/kg BW) for 1 yr. Their initial serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II responses to GH were compared with their 1-yr growth response to therapy. In the prepubertal group (n = 18) the growth rate of all but two children increased 3.4 +/- 0.2 (+/- SEM) cm (from 4.1 +/- 0.2 to 7.5 +/- 0.3 cm/yr). The mean increment in the growth rate of the pubertal group was 5.2 +/- 0.5 cm. In both groups the growth increase was strongly correlated with both the percent increase in serum IGF-I and the percent increase in serum IGF-II during the first 10 days of treatment. No correlation was found between the basal growth rate and basal serum IGF-I or IGF-II levels. In the prepubertal group of children, both the percent increase in serum IGF-I levels in response to GH and the age at start of treatment were predictors of long term growth. We conclude that this subgroup of normal short children with low spontaneous GH secretion and high percent increase in serum IGF values benefits from GH treatment with an increased growth rate.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long term treatment of Graves' disease with iopanoic acid (Telepaque).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To investigate the long term utility of the cholecystographic contrast agent iopanoic acid (Telepaque) for treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism, we studied 40 patients treated with 500 mg, orally, daily for 1-12 months. We measured thyroid size; body weight; serum T3, T4, and free T4 concentrations; and antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibody levels at monthly intervals. Based on the effects of the therapy, the patients were divided into 3 groups: 6 patients had excellent responses with return of serum thyroid hormone levels to normal (group A); 12 patients had fair responses, but 1 thyroid hormone test remained elevated (group B); and 22 patients had minimal benefit (group C) with only slight clinical improvement and transient reduction of serum T3 concentration. Mean serum T3 levels decreased significantly after 1 month of therapy in all 3 groups and became normal in groups A and B, but the reduction in group C was not sustained. Mean serum T4 and free T4 levels remained above normal during the course of therapy in groups B and C. Sixty-eight percent of patients in group C had large goiters compared with 33% of group A and 25% of group B, and those in group C tended to have more severe biochemical hyperthyroidism initially. There were no significant changes in antibody titers during therapy. These data indicate that iopanoic acid is not effective therapy for many hyperthyroid patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Distribution, plasma concentration, and in vivo prolactin-releasing activity of peptide histidine methionine in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The distribution of immunoreactive peptide histidine methionine (PHM) in human tissues and its plasma concentrations were examined using a specific RIA and gel filtration chromatography. The effects of synthetic PHM on anterior pituitary hormone secretion also were studied. Immunoreactive PHM was found in all tissues studied; high concentrations were found in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and parotid gland. Subsequent but smaller amounts of PHM were found in the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, olfactory lobe, and cerebral cortex. The distribution of immunoreactive PHM in human tissues was very similar to that of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and PHM and VIP were in equimolar concentrations. Immunoreactive PHM was also detectable in plasma of normal subjects, and similar plasma concentrations were found in patients with prolactinomas. Molecular sieve chromatography of extracts of nonneural tissues and plasma extracts revealed only one peak, eluting in the position of synthetic PHM. Two peaks of immunoreactive PHM were found in brain tissue; one coeluted with synthetic PHM, and the other eluted in the high mol wt region. Bolus injections of synthetic PHM significantly increased plasma PRL levels in a dose-dependent manner. However, PHM did not alter plasma GH, TSH, ACTH, LH, or FSH levels. These results indicate that PHM is distributed widely in human tissues, and posttranslational processing of the VIP-PHM precursor molecule may be different in different tissues. The finding of equimolar distributions of PHM and VIP is consistent with the notion that these two peptides are synthesized from a common precursor. The presence of immunoreactive PHM in human hypothalamic and pituitary stalk tissue and its specific in vivo PRL-releasing activity suggest that PHM may play an important role in the regulation of PRL secretion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Bone mass and its relationship to age and the menopause.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To examine the influence of age and the menopause on bone loss we studied 178 healthy women, aged 29-78 yr. Bone mass was measured at 2 forearm sites, in the total spine, in the lumbar spine, and in the whole body by single and dual photon absorptiometry. Women of the same age but different menopausal status had significantly different bone masses, whereas a 5-yr difference in age had no effect on bone mass in women with the same menopausal status. At the menopause the hormone changes (low serum estrogen and high serum gonadotropin levels) occurred simultaneously with the appearance of biochemical indices of increased bone turnover. Neither biochemical values nor bone measurements indicated significant bone loss before the menopause. We conclude that the menopause has a greater effect on bone loss than does chronological age.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Production of 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide in human genital skin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 3 alpha-Androstanediol glucuronide (3 alpha diol-G) is produced extrasplanchnically and is a good clinical marker of androgen action in peripheral tissues. However, the direct formation of androgen glucuronides in peripheral sites such as skin has not been determined in man. Genital skin from 21 premenopausal women and 8 men and foreskin from 6 neonates were incubated with either [14C]testosterone [14C]dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to determine the production of DHT glucuronide and 3 alpha diol-G in skin. After hydrolysis of incubation medium with glucuronidase, followed by extraction and sequential chromatography, constant 3H to 14C ratios of 3 alpha diol confirmed the production of DHT glucuronide and 3 alpha diol-g. The conversion of DHT to 3 alpha diol-G was higher than the conversion from testosterone (P less than 0.05), and conversion was higher in men than in women. These data provide evidence for the direct formation of C19 steroid glucuronides by human skin.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sleep-associated decrease in luteinizing hormone pulse frequency during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle: evidence for an opioidergic mechanism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To investigate the possible role of an opioidergic mechanism(s) in the sleep-associated decrease in LH pulse frequency during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, 10 normal cycling women were studied on days 3 and 4 of their cycles before and after the administration of a specific opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone. Sequential 24-h infusions of naloxone (10-mg iv bolus dose followed by an infusion of 30 micrograms/kg . h) or NaCl were administered randomly. Pulsatile LH activity was assessed for 48 h. Sleep was confirmed by electroencephalogram monitoring during the night hours (2300-0700 h). Significant sleep-associated decreases in LH pulse frequency (P less than 0.01) and mean serum LH levels (P less than 0.01) were found during the NaCl control studies. While naloxone infusion had no effect on LH pulse frequency during the waking hours, it prevented the sleep-associated decrease in pulse frequency and, in fact, significantly (P less than 0.001) increased the LH pulse frequency during the sleeping hours. These observations provide evidence that a diurnal variation of naloxone sensitivity exists in early follicular phase women and that the decrease in LH pulse frequency normally found during sleep is based at least in part on increased opioidergic inhibition.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reevaluation of the effects of methylmercaptoimidazole and propylthiouracil in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of methylmercaptoimidazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) were compared in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Firstly, the duration of action of the drugs was studied by the perchlorate discharge test, which was performed 2, 12, or 24 h after administering a single dose of 15 mg MMI or 300 mg PTU. After 2 h, the 9 MMI-treated patients who were tested had marked discharge (mean +/- SD, 65.0 +/- 15.8%), as did the 6 patients treated with PTU (57.6 +/- 26.6%). The mean values for the percent discharge 12 and 24 h after drug administration were 34.9 +/- 31.9% (4 patients) and 36.5 +/- 26.9% (69 patients), respectively, in the MMI group and 19.1 +/- 11.7% (11 patients) and 8.6 +/- 10.5% (7 patients) in the PTU group, indicating that the effect of MMI lasted longer. Secondly, the clinical effects of long term administration of the drugs were compared in a different group of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Within 5 weeks after the onset of treatment, 34 (52%) of 66 patients treated with MMI (10 mg, 3 times daily) were euthyroid, while only 1 of 17 patients treated with PTU (100 mg, 3 times daily) was euthyroid. The average time required to achieve euthyroidism, namely normal serum T3 and T4 levels, was significantly shorter in the MMI group [6.7 +/- 4.6 (+/-SD) weeks] than in the PTU group (16.8 +/- 13.7). In spite of the well known effect of PTU on the extrathyroidal conversion of iodothyronines, the serum T3 level normalized much faster with MMI than with PTU. These results indicate that in our patient population 15 mg MMI had a longer inhibitory effect on the organification of iodide than did 300 mg PTU, and that MMI was more rapidly effective in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Age-related changes in serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone and its biological action in healthy men and women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Circulating levels of PTH and related parameters of calcium and phosphate metabolism were measured in healthy free-living elderly and young subjects residing in the Southwest to determine if parathyroid function changes with aging. Serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) was measured with two well characterized antisera; an amino (N)-terminal antiserum which cross-reacts with the biologically active domain (1-34) and recognizes intact hormone, and a midregion (44-68) antiserum which cross-reacts with intact hormone and biologically inactive midregion/C-terminal fragments. Serum iPTH in both RIAs was significantly increased in the elderly population. An age-related increase was also found for total urinary cAMP and serum alkaline phosphatase, whereas the tubular reabsorptive maximum for phosphate (TmP/GFR) decreased with age. No difference was found between men and women of the same age group for serum iPTH, urinary cAMP, or serum alkaline phosphatase. TmP/GFR declined with age in men, but not women. Correspondingly, serum phosphate was significantly lower in elderly men than in elderly women. Urinary calcium excretion was higher in elderly women than in men of the same age group. Neither serum total or ionized calcium decreased with age. In conclusion, the age-related increase in N-terminal PTH and alterations in associated parameters of phosphate and calcium metabolism are consistent with increased parathyroid function as men and women age. Factors other than PTH are responsible for the sex-related differences observed in TmP/GFR, calcium excretion, and serum phosphate. The cause of the increased circulating levels of apparently biologically active PTH is unclear, but extends beyond the age-related decrease in renal function.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Studies of acute effects of insulin-like growth factors I and II in human fat cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The acute metabolic effects and receptor binding of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II were studied in human adipose tissue. The IGFs inhibited fat cell glycerol release and stimulated adipocyte 3-O-methylglucose transport and adipose tissue glucose oxidation as effectively as did insulin, but the biological potencies of the IGFs, on a molar basis, were 600-1000 times less than that of insulin. The insulin dose-response curve for antilipolysis gradually shifted to the left in the presence of submaximally and maximally effective IGF-I concentrations, whereas no additive response was found when fat cells were incubated with maximally effective concentrations of insulin and the IGFs. Adipocyte [125I]IGF-I and -II binding was low and was not inhibited by excess unlabeled IGF. In contrast, IGF-I inhibited [125I]insulin binding with a molar potency 1600 times lower than that of native insulin. In adipose tissue segments obtained from patients with untreated noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IGF-I and insulin inhibited glycerol release in a normal way. Conversely, neither insulin nor IGF-I increased the rate of glucose oxidation significantly above the nonhormone-stimulated level. We conclude that human fat cells lack specific cell surface IGF-binding sites. However, the IGFs definitely produce acute insulin-like effects in the human adipocyte, which seems to be mediated via the insulin receptor.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in oxytocin and vasopressin secretion during sexual activity in men.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We measured plasma oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations in 13 normal men during sexual arousal and ejaculation. Mean plasma AVP increased from 1.4 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) to 5.3 +/- 1.7 pmol/L (P less than 0.05) during arousal, but there was no significant change in OT. In contrast, at ejaculation mean plasma OT rose from a basal value of 1.4 +/- 0.3 to 7.3 +/- 0.6 pmol/L (P less than 0.01) and then fell to basal concentrations in 30 min. AVP, however, had returned to basal levels at the time of ejaculation and remained stable thereafter. We conclude that in man AVP is secreted during sexual arousal, and there is, subsequently, a selective release of OT at the time of ejaculation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Identification of calcitonin receptors in human spermatozoa.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Calcitonin (CT) is a powerful hypocalcemic hormone which regulates calcium balance in cells. The presence of CT and CT receptors has been demonstrated in many extrathyroidal tissues, including the male genital tract. CT immunoreactivity has also been found in human seminal fluid, and an inhibitory effect of salmon CT on human sperm motility in vitro was recently reported. In this study the presence of specific binding sites for synthetic salmon CT in intact human spermatozoa was investigated using [125I]salmon CT. Binding experiments demonstrated a CT-sperm interaction involving a receptor-mediated mechanism. The binding was very rapid and minimally reversible, with the maximal site saturation occurring at approximately 2 nM labeled peptide. The dissociation of the CT-receptor complex was only slightly influenced by the addition of unlabeled hormone. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled salmon, eel, and human CT produced a dose-dependent inhibition of [125I]salmon CT binding. These data fulfill the major criteria for demonstration of specific receptors for salmon CT in human spermatozoa. Owing to the key role of calcium ions in regulating sperm motility and the onset of the acrosomal reaction, CT receptors could be important in male gamete physiology.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- In vitro net progesterone production by human corpora lutea: effects of human chorionic gonadotropin, dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, cholera toxin, and forskolin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Slices of human corpora lutea (CL) obtained at varying stages of the luteal phase from 21 women were used to study the effect of hCG on progesterone (P4) production. Slices obtained from mid- and late CL incubated with 10 IU/mL hCG exhibited a significant increase in net P4 production (P less than 0.001), whereas slices from early CL did not. Mid-CL slices were the most sensitive to hCG (4.2-fold increase in P4 production compared to 1.2-fold for early CL and 2.7-fold for late CL). To investigate the unresponsiveness of early CL to hCG, [125I]hCG binding was studied. All early CL had LH/hCG-specific receptors, and the apparent Kd for this binding was 1.95 X 10(-10) M. Dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM), cholera toxin (0.84 mM), and forskolin (50 microM) stimulated net P4 production (P less than 0.05) in slices of early CL tissue incubated in the presence of methylisobutylxanthine (0.1 mM). Cholera toxin and forskolin stimulated cAMP formation by the early CL, but hCG failed to do so. These results confirm that hCG has an age-dependent stimulatory effect on CL P4 synthesis. Our findings suggest that there is inadequate coupling of the LH/hCG receptor and adenylate cyclase in the early human CL, which explains in part the relative insensitivity of this tissue to the steroidogenic action of hCG.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The sex pheromone precursor androsta-5,16-dien-3 beta-ol is a major early metabolite in in vitro pregnenolone metabolism in human testicular homogenates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In an earlier report we described the early time sequence of the in vitro metabolism of [4-14C]pregnenolone ([4-14C]P5) to testosterone in homogenates of human and rat testes and demonstrated the appearance of mainly delta 5 (humans)- and delta 4 (rats)-steroids within minutes after starting the incubation. In this study strong evidence is presented for the substantial synthesis from P5 of the sex pheromone precursor androsta-5,16-dien-3 beta-ol (ADL) in human, but not rat, testicular homogenates. The 16-unsaturated C19 steroid ADL appeared after 1 min of incubation, and within 5 min reached values (17-23% of total radioactivity added as [4-14C]P5) comparable to those of the major delta 5-steroids 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone. Thus, in humans, as in boars, the sex attractant precursor ADL is a major early testicular metabolite of P5.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of diet on oxidation of 17 beta-estradiol in vivo.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of a high fat, low carbohydrate, low protein diet on the in vivo oxidation of 17 beta-estradiol was studied using radiometric methods. Five male chimpanzees were fed a normal (13%) fat diet or a high (65%) fat diet for 8 weeks. After a 4-week rest period, the animals were fed the alternative diet. The mean percent oxidation of 16 alpha-[3H]estradiol-17 beta 24 h after injection was 3.8 +/- 1.3% (+/- SD) on the normal diet vs. 18.4 +/- 4.7% on the high fat diet (P less than 0.01). In contrast, the mean percent oxidation of 2-[3H]estradiol 24 h after injection was 31.6 +/- 3.8% (+/- SD) on the normal diet vs. 20.0 +/- 3.5% on the high fat diet (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that the oxidation of 17 beta-estradiol to estriols relative to that to catechol estrogens is increased by a high fat diet.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dependence of mean levels of circulating luteinizing hormone upon pulsatile amplitude and frequency.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We investigated the relationship between mean serum LH levels and the amplitude and frequency of LH pulses in 23 women. Serum LH levels were determined every 10 min for 8-12 h in 6 normal cycling women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, in 9 women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and in 8 postmenopausal women. A striking linear correlation (r = 0.98; P less than 0.00001) was found between the mean LH value during the study period (range, 11.1-137.7 IU/L) and the product of the mean LH pulse amplitude and frequency. The interdependence of these variables was further explored using a mathematical model which identifies two main determinants of the slope of the regression line relating the mean LH value to the product of mean pulse amplitude and frequency: 1) the set of constants that specify the biexponential disappearance pattern of LH from serum and 2) the fraction of LH associated with a given pulse which is released from the anterior pituitary after the peak peripheral LH level is reached. Our data, viewed in the light of this model, suggest that 1) the rate at which LH is cleared from the peripheral circulation (expressed as percentage removed per unit time) is independent of both LH concentrations and the sex steroid milieu, and 2) most circulating LH is released in discrete pulses and little, if any, is released in a nonpulsatile or "tonic" mode.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Enhanced calcium bioavailability from a solubilized form of calcium citrate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An improved formulation of calcium citrate with higher aqueous solubility and bioavailability was sought. Mixtures of calcium hydroxide and citric acid, with a calcium to citrate molar ratio ranging from 0.67-1.5, dissolved rapidly in water, creating a metastably supersaturated solution. The presence of an excess of citrate in the mixture delayed the precipitation of calcium citrate and kept calcium in solution longer. Thus, the mixture with a calcium to citrate molar ratio of 1.25, containing 500 mg elemental calcium, dissolved in 300 mL water within 2 min and could be kept in solution for 1 h at a wide pH range between 2 and 7. Intestinal calcium absorption, measured from the increment in urinary calcium during the second 2 h following an oral calcium load (500 mg) in 15 normal subjects was significantly higher from the mixtures (calcium to citrate molar ratios of 1.5 and 1.25) than from tricalcium dicitrate. The fractional calcium absorption, obtained from fecal recovery of radiocalcium after oral administration of 500 mg calcium prelabeled with 47Ca in 11 normal subjects, was also higher for the mixture with a calcium to citrate molar ratio of 1.25. The most efficient calcium absorption was obtained with the mixture of calcium hydroxide and citric acid with a calcium to citrate molar ratio of 1.25. The increment in urinary calcium after an oral load with this mixture was 62.4% greater than that obtained with tricalcium dicitrate [0.138 +/- 0.056 (+/- SD) vs. 0.085 +/- 0.086 mg/dL glomerular filtrate; P less than 0.05]. The fractional calcium absorption was 88.4% higher (0.324 +/- 0.107 vs. 0.172 +/- 0.061; P less than 0.05). This mixture provided the highest concentration of ionic calcium, indicating that calcium (rather than calcium-citrate complex) is the fraction absorbed from the intestinal tract. This study, therefore, suggests that a liquid calcium preparation formulated from the mixture of calcium hydroxide and citric acid is more effective than a solid preparation of tricalcium dicitrate in providing soluble and bioavailable calcium.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The O-linked oligosaccharide structures are striking different on pregnancy and choriocarcinoma HCG.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- hCG is a glycoprotein hormone which is detected in the serum and urine of pregnant women and of patients with hydatidiform mole and choriocarcinoma. The molecule contains 4 O-linked sugar chains. In an effort to identify cancer markers, the structures of these sugar units on the hCG produced in pregnancy and choriocarcinoma were compared. hCG molecules in patient urines were purified by immuno-affinity chromatography and gel filtration. beta-elimination was used to cleave the O-linked sugar units, radioactive sodium borohydride to label them, and gel filtration on Bio-Gel P4 to size them and compare their elution volumes with those of standard oligosaccharides of known structure. A trisaccharide, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-, was found to be the principal unit attached to urinary hCG from pregnant women (10 samples). A hexasaccharide, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3(NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4 GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc-, which accounted for just 6% (mean, range 0-14%) of the O-linked sugar units on pregnancy hCG, was the principal unit (mean 52% of total, range 50-56%) attached to the hCG from choriocarcinoma patient urines (3 samples). These results indicate that hexasaccharide-abundant hCG is an indicator of choriocarcinoma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Absence of the plasma growth hormone-binding protein in Laron-type dwarfism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We recently described a specific, high affinity binding protein (BP) for growth hormone (GH) in normal human plasma. Little is known about the source, regulation and biological role of this BP. Because its specificity is similar to that of the GH receptor, we considered the possibility that it represented a circulating receptor subunit or fragment. Laron-type dwarfism is a rare disorder characterized by severe growth failure, resistance to GH, and GH receptor deficiency. To probe the relationship between the receptor and the circulating binding protein, we measured the binding of GH to plasma from a child with Laron-type dwarfism and compared it with that in plasma of normal children and adults. Normal plasma samples were supplemented with unlabeled GH to the endogenous GH level in the plasma of the Laron patient to yield comparable saturation of the BP. After incubation of plasma with radiolabeled GH, bound GH was separated from free GH by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. There was no detectable binding (less than 1.5%) of GH in the plasma of the Laron-type dwarf, whereas in normal children the bound GH fraction averaged 24.0 +/- 6.1% (mean +/- SD). Thus, the GH-BP is either absent or functionally abnormal in Laron-type dwarfism. This finding suggests that the circulating GH-BP is related to and/or may be derived from the GH receptor. Alternatively, it is possible that the BP plays an as yet poorly understood pivotal role in the promotion of somatic growth.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Purification of a human liver cytochrome P-450 immunochemically related to several cytochromes P-450 purified from untreated rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Among characterized forms of liver microsomal cytochromes P-450 in rats are four related isozymes (P-450f-i) notable for their lack of inducibility. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that human livers microsomes contained several proteins related to these rat P-450s. A human liver P-450, termed HLx, was purified and found by immunochemical assays to resemble rat P-450g. Analysis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of HLx indicates that it is related to rat P-450s f-i and human liver P-450MP. A monoclonal antibody was used to measure the amounts of HLx in 21 human liver specimens. No correlation between the levels of HLx protein in these specimens and the patients' environmental histories was observed. However, statistical analysis of the data suggests that the distribution of HLx is at least bimodal. We conclude that HLx is a member of a family of human liver P-450s that resembles in its structure, and possibly in its distribution, several liver P-450s found in other animals.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Identification of glucocorticoid-inducible cytochromes P-450 in the intestinal mucosa of rats and man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We used monoclonal antibodies and complementary DNAs (cDNAs) to glucocorticoid-inducible liver cytochromes P-450 in rats (P-450p) and in man (HLp) to search for related cytochromes in intestinal mucosa. In rat enterocytes, we found two dexamethasone-inducible proteins related to the steroid-inducible liver cytochromes P-450. Induction of these proteins in enterocytes was associated with increases in the amount of a P-450p-related messenger RNA and of erythromycin demethylase, an activity highly characteristic of P-450p and HLp. Similar studies on human jejunal enterocytes revealed a microsomal protein indistinguishable from HLp on immunoblots and an abundance of RNA hybridizing with HLp cDNA. In human enterocytes the specific concentration of the HLp-related cytochrome (measured immunochemically or as erythromycin demethylase activity) was similar to that found in human liver and could account for all of the CO-binding hemo-protein detected. We conclude that the intestinal mucosa contains prominent form(s) of cytochromes P-450 similar to liver cytochrome P-450p in their structure, function, and some regulatory characteristics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Body composition, not body weight, is related to cardiovascular disease risk factors and sex hormone levels in men.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To clarify the independent relationships of obesity and overweight to cardiovascular disease risk factors and sex steroid levels, three age-matched groups of men were studied: (i) 8 normal weight men, less than 15% body fat, by hydrostatic weighing; (ii) 16 overweight, obese men, greater than 25% body fat and 135-160% of ideal body weight (IBW); and (iii) 8 overweight, lean men, 135-160% IBW, but less than 15% fat. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater for the obese (mean +/- SEM, 82 +/- 2 mmHg) than the normal (71 +/- 2) and overweight lean (72 +/- 2) groups, as were low density lipoprotein levels (131 +/- 9 vs. 98 + 11 and 98 + 14 mg/dl), the ratio of high density lipoprotein to total cholesterol (0.207 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.308 +/- 0.03 and 0.302 +/- 0.03), fasting plasma insulin (22 +/- 3 vs. 12 +/- 1 and 13 +/- 2 microU/ml), and the estradiol/testosterone ratio (0.076 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.042 +/- 0.02 and 0.052 +/- 0.02); P less than 0.05. Estradiol was 25% greater for the overweight lean group (40 +/- 5 pg/ml) than the obese (30 +/- 3 pg/ml) and normal groups (29 +/- 2 pg/ml), P = 0.08, whereas total testosterone was significantly lower in the obese (499 +/- 33 ng/dl) compared with the normal and overweight, lean groups (759 +/- 98 and 797 +/- 82 ng/dl). Estradiol was uncorrelated with risk factors and the estradiol/testosterone ratio appeared to be a function of the reduced testosterone levels in obesity, not independently correlated with lipid levels after adjustment for body fat content. Furthermore, no risk factors were significantly different between the normal and overweight lean groups. We conclude that (a) body composition, rather than body weight per se, is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk factors; and (b) sex steroid alterations are related to body composition and are not an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regulation of gastric acid secretion by neurotensin in man. Evidence against a hormonal role.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The present study was designed to evaluate neurotensin as a hormonal regulator of gastric acid secretion in man. After a fat-rich meal, the strongest known stimulus of neurotensin release, plasma neurotensin-like immunoreactivity (NTLI) was elevated from 7.6 +/- 1.9 to 15.5 +/- 2.5 pM. Plasma NTLI was measured with antiserum L170, which requires the biologically active carboxyl-terminal hexapeptide of the neurotensin molecule for recognition and does not crossreact significantly with any known natural catabolite in human plasma. Intravenous infusion of neurotensin at 25 pmol X kg-1 h-1 resulted in a plasma level of 14.7 +/- 2.1 pM, similar to the maximal physiological level observed after the fat-rich meal. Intravenous infusion of neurotensin at 25 pmol X kg-1 h-1 during 2 h, however, failed to significantly inhibit peptone meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion measured by intragastric titration. The 2-h acid output to peptone was 40.8 +/- 6.2 and 41.3 +/- 6.9 mmol during the vehicle and the neurotensin infusion, respectively. Intravenous infusion of neurotensin at 100 or 400 pmol X kg-1 h-1 did not affect acid output, whereas at 1,600 pmol X kg-1 h-1, which resulted in a plasma neurotensin concentration of 725 +/- 80 pM, significantly reduced peptone meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The neurotensin-induced inhibition of acid output was independent of the hormone gastrin. The present results provide evidence against a hormonal role for neurotensin in the regulation of meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion in man.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of fetal adrenalectomy on catecholamine release and physiologic adaptation at birth in sheep.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Plasma catecholamine levels increase dramatically at birth. To determine the contribution of adrenal catecholamine secretion to the surge in catecholamines at birth and the role in newborn adaptation, we performed surgical adrenalectomy or sham operation on near-term ovine fetuses. After recovery in utero, the animals were delivered and supported by mechanical ventilation. Plasma catecholamine levels, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary function, surfactant secretion, and release of free fatty acids (FFA) and glucose were compared in control and adrenalectomized animals. Plasma epinephrine increased rapidly at birth in controls but was undetectable in adrenalectomized animals. Norepinephrine levels were not statistically different. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output and contractility increased abruptly after cord cutting in controls but did not increase in adrenalectomized animals. Lung compliance, pulmonary function, surfactant pool size, glucose and FFA levels were significantly decreased in adrenalectomized animals. These results suggest that adrenal epinephrine secretion is vital to many of the adaptive events at birth.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Demonstration of 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine as a drug binding inhibitor in newborn infants.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Newborn infants have drug binding defects that share similarities to those of uremic subjects. Since 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine has been chemically defined to be a major drug binding inhibitor in uremia, a search for the presence of a similar compound in the sera of newborn infants was made. An organic substance that has the characteristics of 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine as supported by the retardation factor values on thin-layer chromatograms, retention times of high performance liquid chromatograms, fluorescence emission spectra, and mass spectrum has been demonstrated to be present in the majority of the neonatal sera studied. A strong positive correlation between the levels of the binding inhibitor and the extent of binding defects for nafcillin has been observed. The substance could effectively reduce the total bilirubin concentration when added to the cord sera specimens. It is concluded that 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine plays an important role in drug binding defects observed in the newborn, and the inhibitor may also play a part in the precipitation of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in neonates when the substance is abnormally elevated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metabolism and placental transfer of 125I-proinsulin and 125I-tyrosylated C-peptide in the pregnant rhesus monkey.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 125I-Proinsulin or 125I-tyrosylated-C-peptide (125I-tyr-CP) was administered to pregnant Rhesus monkeys by bolus followed by constant infusion to examine placental transfer of these peptides. At the end of each infusion, fetuses were exsanguinated in situ via the umbilical vein. The bolus-constant infusion technique produced a steady state in maternal plasma of immunoprecipitable label, measured using excess insulin or C-peptide antiserum. In animals infused with 125I-proinsulin, analysis of umbilical venous plasma revealed no apparent transfer to the fetus of immunoprecipitable label. In animals infused with 125I-tyr-CP, 3-13% of the umbilical venous plasma radioactivity was immunoprecipitable, representing 1.4-5.8% of the immunoprecipitable radioactivity in maternal plasma at delivery. Gel filtration chromatography of umbilical venous plasma revealed that the immunoprecipitated moiety was a fragment of 125I-tyr-CP. Analysis of maternal plasma showed that the predominant peak of radioactivity represented intact C-peptide. A peak corresponding to the fetal immunoprecipitable peak was also present. Analysis of simultaneous maternal arterial and uterine vein plasma samples showed that degradation of 125I-tyr-CP occurred across the uterus. Studies in one nonpregnant and three postpartum animals indicated that pregnancy increased the rate of metabolism of 125I-tyr-CP. When 125I-tyr-CP was incubated with trophoblastic cells in culture, degradation to a species corresponding on gel filtration to the immunoprecipitable fetal metabolite was found. We conclude that proinsulin, like insulin, does not traverse the placenta. Immunoreactive fragments of C-peptide do cross, however, and pregnancy alters the metabolism of 125I-tyr-CP, probably owing to placental degradation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gray platelet syndrome. Demonstration of alpha granule membranes that can fuse with the cell surface.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Platelets from patients with the gray platelet syndrome have decreased recognizable alpha granules and are markedly deficient in some alpha-granule secretory proteins. Using immunocytochemical techniques with antibodies to an alpha-granule membrane protein, GMP-140, we identified the membranes of intracellular vesicles in gray platelets as alpha-granule membranes. Gray platelets contained normal amounts of GMP-140 as measured by electroimmunoassay. The activation of gray platelets with thrombin caused GMP-140 to be redistributed to the plasma membrane surface, as in normal platelets. In agreement with previous studies, an endogenously synthesized secretory protein, platelet factor 4, was undetectable in gray platelets. However, the alpha-granule proteins albumin and IgG, which are thought to be derived from endocytosis of plasma proteins into megakaryocytes, were present in substantial quantities and were secreted efficiently from gray platelets. Therefore, the fundamental defect in the gray platelet syndrome may be in the targeting of endogenously synthesized secretory proteins to developing alpha granules in megakaryocytes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dietary intake of phosphorus modulates the circadian rhythm in serum concentration of phosphorus. Implications for the renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We recently reported that in healthy men, changes in the production rate (PR) of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] accounted for the 80% increase and the 30% decrease in its serum concentration that was induced by restriction and supplementation, respectively, of dietary phosphorus. These changes in PR and serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D could be mediated by changes in serum concentrations of phosphorus that occur after the morning fasting period. To examine this hypothesis, we measured serum concentrations of phosphorus in blood drawn at hourly intervals for 24 h in six healthy men in whom dietary phosphorus was initially maintained at 1,500 mg/70 kg body weight per day for 9 d, then restricted to 500 mg/d (coupled with orally administered aluminum hydroxide) for 10 d, and then supplemented to 3,000 mg/d for 10 d. When dietary phosphorus was normal, the serum concentration of phosphorus exhibited the normal circadian rhythm: a rapid decrease in early morning to a nadir at 1100, followed by an increase to plateau at 1600 h and a further increase to an acrophase (peak) at 0030 h. The variation in serum levels of phosphorus can be described as the sum of sinusoidal functions with periodicities of 24 and 12 h. Phosphorus restriction for 10 d induced a 40% reduction in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus, abolished the early afternoon rise in its serum level (i.e., the 12-h periodic component of the time series), and delayed the acrophase by 3 h to 0330 h. Phosphorus supplementation for 10 d induced a 14% increase in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus but no significant change in its morning fasting level, exaggerated the early afternoon rise in serum phosphorus, and advanced the acrophase by 9 h to 1530 h. The changes in the PR of 1,25-(OH)2D induced by restriction and supplementation of dietary phosphorus varied inversely and significantly with those induced in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus (R = -0.88, P less than 0.001). These data demonstrate that in healthy men, dietary phosphorus is an important determinant of the serum concentration of phosphorus throughout most of the day. The data suggest that diet-induced changes in serum levels of phosphorus mediate the changes in PR and serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of adrenalectomy on transport in the rat medullary thick ascending limb.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous studies in adrenalectomized (Adx) rats suggest that aldosterone may regulate ion transport in the ascending portion of Helen's loop. In order to examine directly the effect of adrenalectomy on transport, medullary thick ascending limb (Mtal) segments were isolated from Adx, Adx replaced with aldosterone (Adx + Ald, 0.5 micrograms X 100 g X body wt X d), and control Sprague-Dawley rats. Both net sodium and net chloride fluxes were significantly less in the Mtal segments from Adx rats compared with those in the control or Adx + Ald group. Physiologic levels of exogenous aldosterone increased net sodium chloride flux toward control values in the Adx + Ald group. Net potassium flux was not different among the three groups. We conclude that adrenalectomy impairs reabsorptive NaCl but not K transport in the Mtal, and that aldosterone restores this process. This reabsorptive defect may contribute to the urinary concentrating and diluting abnormality associated with adrenal insufficiency.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Myocardial energy production and consumption remain balanced during positive inotropic stimulation when coronary flow is restricted to basal rates in rabbit heart.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect on myocardial energy balance of increasing oxygen demand without altering basal myocardial perfusion rate was assessed in isolated, isovolumic, retrograde blood perfused rabbit hearts. Myocardial energy requirements were increased with paired stimulation. The capacity of rapid paired stimulation to increase mechanical energy consumption was demonstrated in the presence of increased perfusion with the rate X pressure product and oxygen consumption increasing 86 and 148%, respectively, compared with control values. In contrast, rapid paired stimulation under constant, basal flow conditions did not alter the rate X pressure product, while oxygen extraction and consumption increased only 40% relative to control. Myocardial ATP, creatine-phosphate, and lactate content were identical under control and constant flow-paired stimulation conditions. The results of this study indicate that no detectable energy imbalance was produced by rapid paired stimulation with flow held constant at basal rates. These results suggest that the myocardium does not increase mechanical energy expenditure in response to inotropic or rate stimulation in the presence of restricted flow reserve and are inconsistent with the concept of "demand-induced" or "relative" myocardial ischemia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Transient elevation of messenger RNA encoding gastrin-releasing peptide, a putative pulmonary growth factor in human fetal lung.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), the mammalian homologue of the amphibian peptide bombesin, is present in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and appears to be a growth factor for both normal and neoplastic pulmonary cells. Previously we have reported the cloning of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and gene that encode human GRP. We now report that GRP mRNAs are markedly elevated in human fetal lung during the canalicular phase of pulmonary development (from approximately 16 to 30 wk gestation). By RNA blot and in situ hybridization analyses, GRP mRNAs were first detectable in fetal lung at 9-10 wk, plateaued at levels 25-fold higher than in adult lungs from 16 to approximately 30 wk and then declined to near adult levels by 34 wk gestation. By contrast, GRP peptide levels remain elevated until several months after birth. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies showed that GRP mRNA and peptide consistently colocalized in early gestation lung but that in neonatal lung, many cells that contained GRP peptide no longer contained GRP mRNA. The transient expression of high levels of GRP mRNAs during an approximately 12-wk phase of fetal lung development suggests that the secretion of GRP or its COOH-terminal peptides from pulmonary neuroendocrine cells may play a role in normal lung development.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Induction of the skeletal alpha-actin gene in alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated hypertrophy of rat cardiac myocytes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Myocardial hypertrophy in vivo is associated with reexpression of contractile protein isogenes characteristic of fetal and neonatal development. The molecular signals for hypertrophy and isogene switching are unknown. We studied alpha (sarcomeric)-actin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cultured cardiac myocytes from the neonatal rat. In the cultured cells, as in the adult heart in vivo, expression of cardiac alpha-actin (cACT) predominated over that of skeletal alpha-actin (sACT) mRNA, the fetal/neonatal isoform. alpha 1-Adrenergic receptor stimulation induced hypertrophy of these cells, increasing total RNA and cytoskeletal actin mRNA by 1.8-fold over control, and total alpha-actin mRNA by 4.3 fold. This disproportionate increase in total alpha-actin mRNA was produced by a preferential induction of sACT mRNA, which increased by 10.6-fold over control versus only 2.6-fold for cACT mRNA. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor is the first identified molecular mediator of early developmental isogene reexpression in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Molecular studies of ceruloplasmin deficiency in Wilson's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Deficiency of serum ceruloplasmin is a characteristic biochemical abnormality of Wilson's disease, although the mechanism of this finding is unknown. Ceruloplasmin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were therefore examined in five patients with Wilson's disease and five controls with other types of hepatic disease. Northern and dot blot hybridizations showed that detectable ceruloplasmin mRNA was present in all of the patients with Wilson's disease, including one patient with no detectable serum ceruloplasmin. However, the ceruloplasmin mRNA levels in the Wilson's disease patients were only 33% that of controls (P less than 0.001). In contrast, albumin mRNA levels in the Wilson's disease patients averaged 161% that of controls. In an attempt to better delineate the level of gene expression responsible for this decrease in ceruloplasmin mRNA, the nuclear run-on assay was used to analyze transcriptional rates. The amount of ceruloplasmin gene transcription in four Wilson's patients was decreased to 44% that of three controls. These results indicate that the diminished serum ceruloplasmin levels in patients with Wilson's disease are due at least in part to a decrease in ceruloplasmin gene transcription.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Isolation of a complementary DNA clone for thyroid microsomal antigen. Homology with the gene for thyroid peroxidase.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The thyroid microsomal antigen (MSA) in autoimmune thyroid disease is a protein of approximately 107 kD. We screened a human thyroid cDNA library constructed in the expression vector lambda gt11 with anti-107-kD monoclonal antibodies. Of five clones obtained, the recombinant beta-galactosidase fusion protein from one clone (PM-5) was confirmed to react with the monoclonal antiserum. The complementary DNA (cDNA) insert from PM-5 (0.8 kb) was used as a probe on Northern blot analysis to estimate the size of the mRNA coding for the MSA. The 2.9-kb messenger RNA (mRNA) species observed was the same size as that coding for human thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The probe did not bind to human liver mRNA, indicating the thyroid-specific nature of the PM-5-related mRNA. The nucleotide sequence of PM-5 (842 bp) was determined and consisted of a single open reading frame. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of PM-5 with that presently available for pig TPO indicates 84% homology. In conclusion, a cDNA clone representing part of the microsomal antigen has been isolated. Sequence homology with porcine TPO, as well as identity in the size of the mRNA species for both the microsomal antigen and TPO, indicate that the microsomal antigen is, at least in part, TPO.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Apical Na+/H+ antiporter and glycolysis-dependent H+-ATPase regulate intracellular pH in the rabbit S3 proximal tubule.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The apical transport processes responsible for proton secretion were studied in the isolated perfused rabbit S3 proximal tubule. Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured with the pH dye, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Steady state pHi in S3 tubules in nominally HCO3(-)-free solutions was 7.08 +/- 0.03. Removal of Na+ (lumen) caused a decrease in pHi of 0.34 +/- 0.06 pH/min. The decrease in pHi was inhibited 62% by 1 mM amiloride (lumen) and was unaffected by 50 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (lumen) and Cl- removal (lumen, bath). After a brief exposure to 20 mM NH4Cl, pHi fell by approximately 0.7 and recovered at a rate of 0.89 +/- 0.15 pH/min in the nominal absence of Na+, HCO3-, organic anions, and SO4(2-) (lumen, bath). 1 mM N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (lumen), 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (lumen), 0.5 mM colchicine (bath), and 0.5 mM iodoacetic acid (lumen, bath) inhibited the Na+-independent pHi recovery rate by 73%, 55%, 77%, and 86%, respectively, whereas 1 mM KCN (lumen, bath) did not inhibit pHi recovery. Reduction of intracellular, but not extracellular chloride, also decreased the Na+-independent pHi recovery rate. In conclusion, the S3 proximal tubule has an apical Na+/H+ antiporter with a Michaelis constant for Na+ of 29 mM and a maximum velocity of 0.47 pH/min. S3 tubules also possess a plasma membrane H+-ATPase that can regulate pHi, has a requirement for intracellular chloride, and utilizes ATP derived primarily from glycolysis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of the Na+/H+ antiporter in rat proximal tubule bicarbonate absorption.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Amiloride and the more potent amiloride analog, 5-(N-t-butyl) amiloride (t-butylamiloride), were used to examine the role of the Na+/H+ antiporter in bicarbonate absorption in the in vivo microperfused rat proximal convoluted tubule. Bicarbonate absorption was inhibited 29, 46, and 47% by 0.9 mM or 4.3 mM amiloride, or 1 mM t-butylamiloride, respectively. Sensitivity of the Na+/H+ antiporter to these compounds in vivo was examined using fluorescent measurements of intracellular pH with (2', 7')-bis(carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Amiloride and t-butylamiloride were shown to be as potent against the antiporter in vivo as in brush border membrane vesicles. A model of proximal tubule bicarbonate absorption was used to correct for changes in the luminal profiles for pH and inhibitor concentration, and for changes in luminal flow rate in the various series. We conclude that the majority of apical membrane proton secretion involved in transepithelial bicarbonate absorption is mediated by the Na+-dependent, amiloride-sensitive Na+H+ antiporter. However, a second mechanism of proton secretion contributes significantly to bicarbonate absorption. This mechanism is Na+-independent and amiloride-insensitive.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dietary calcium intake and rates of bone loss in women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We measured bone mineral density (BMD) at the midradius and lumbar spine in 106 normal women, ages 23-84 yr (61 were postmenopausal). Three to nine measurements (median, four) were made over 2.6 to 6.6 yr (mean, 4.1 yr). The correlation between calcium intake (range, 260-2,035 mg/d) and rate of change in BMD was not significant at the midradius (r = 0.06) or lumbar spine (r = 0.08), even after adjusting for age, menopausal status, and serum estrogen levels by multiple regression analysis. Women in the lower (mean, 501 mg/d) and in the upper (mean, 1,397 mg/d) quartiles of dietary intake had similar rates of change in BMD (%/yr [mean +/- SE], at midradius, -0.78 +/- 0.24 and -0.91 +/- 0.17 for lower and upper quartiles, respectively; at lumbar spine, -1.06 +/- 0.24 and 0.98 +/- 0.24). These data do not support the hypothesis that insufficient dietary calcium is a major cause of bone loss in women.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Microcomputer software to facilitate costing in pathology laboratories.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A software program is described which will enable laboratory managers to calculate, for their laboratory over a 12 month period, the cost of each test or investigation and of components of that cost. These comprise the costs of direct labour, consumables, equipment maintenance and depreciation; allocated costs of intermediate operations--for example, specimen procurement, reception, and data processing; and apportioned indirect costs such as senior staff time as well as external overheads such as telephone charges, rent, and rates. Total annual expenditure on each type of test is also calculated. The principles on which the program is based are discussed. Considered in particular, are the problems of apportioning indirect costs (which are considerable in clinical laboratory work) over different test costs, and the merits of different ways of estimating the amount or fraction of staff members' time spent on each kind of test. The computer program is Crown copyright but is available under licence from one of us (JAS).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Infections in British clinical laboratories, 1984-5.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During 1984-5 this continuing survey showed that 41 infections occurred in the staff of 193 laboratories, representing 23,043.5 person years of exposure. The community was the probable source of two cases each of hepatitis A and B, one of tuberculosis, two of campylobacter enteritis, and 12 of Norwalk viral diarrhoea. Occupational exposure was the probable cause of six hepatitis B infections (affecting haematology, biochemistry, and microbiology staff), three of tuberculosis (affecting mortuary and morbid anatomy workers), seven shigella, three salmonella (including one typhoid) and one pseudocholera infection (all in microbiology medical laboratory scientific officers), and a streptococcal infection in a mortuary technician. An episode of hepatitis of uncertain cause affected a carrier of hepatitis B. The incidence of reported infections of all types was 178 per 100,000 person years (91 for infections of suspected occupational origin). The highest incidence was in morbid anatomy and mortuary workers, followed by microbiology medical laboratory scientific officers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Protein A and coagulase expression in epidemic and non-epidemic Staphylococcus aureus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Strains of Staphylococcus aureus were divided into groups on the basis of antimicrobial sensitivity and epidemiology and tested for protein A expression in a simple microtitre test, which detected the non-immunological binding of immunoglobulin to protein A on whole cells of S aureus. Isolates of the methicillin resistant strain prevalent in south east England (EMRSA) showed a low expression of protein A compared with the other strains of methicillin resistant S aureus (MRSA), other multiple resistant strains, and sensitive strains. Protein A and coagulase expression in 27 strains of MRSA from 15 countries associated with hospital outbreaks were compared with 27 strains of MRSA from 11 countries reported to be sporadic isolates. Twenty four of the 27 outbreak associated MRSA showed low expression of protein A and high expression of coagulase. Conversely, sporadic strains generally gave higher levels of protein A and a wide variety of coagulase reactions. The results suggest that many epidemic strains of MRSA may have phenotypic characteristics that distinguish them from sporadic strains.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Campylobacter pyloridis and acid induced gastric metaplasia in the pathogenesis of duodenitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Biopsy specimens of gastric and duodenal mucosa from 290 patients were examined histologically for metaplasia and Campylobacter pyloridis. Estimates of pH on samples of fasting gastric juice from 55 of the patients were performed, and mucosal biopsy specimens from 33 patients were also cultured for C pyloridis. Active duodenitis was seen in 34 duodenal biopsy specimens. Thirty (88%) of the patients with active duodenitis had both greater than 5% gastric metaplasia in the duodenal specimen and C pyloridis associated gastritis. These two factors coexisted in only 0.43% of patients with no duodenal inflammation. When C pyloridis were seen histologically in duodenal biopsy specimens they were confined to areas of gastric metaplasia and never occurred in the absence of a polymorph infiltrate. Of the 55 patients with measurements of gastric juice pH, gastric metaplasia was present in the duodenum in 20 of 42 with a pH of less than 2.5, and in 0 of 13 with a pH of greater than 2.5. These results suggest that acid induced gastric metaplasia in the duodenum and C pyloridis associated gastritis may be synergistic in the pathogenesis of duodenitis; the metaplastic gastric epithelium allows C pyloridis to colonise the duodenal mucosa, where it produces an acute inflammatory response.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Use of monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA to detect IgM class antibodies specific for Toxoplasma gondii.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two monoclonal antibodies CH6 and C1E3 were used in an antibody class capture assay for the detection of IgM antibodies specific for Toxoplasma gondii. CH6 was used on the solid phase to capture human IgM. After a Toxoplasma gondii antigen had been added, specifically bound material was detected using C1E3 coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The assay was compared with an established system using polyclonal antisera at both the capture and antigen detection stages. A good correlation was found, with 97.3% (125 of 128) of sera giving the same classification in both assays. Three sera were positive only in the polyclonal system. No false positive results were found when 118 negative sera were examined. The two monoclonal antibodies provide a viable alternative to the use of polyclonal sera at the capture and antigen detection stages in the antibody class capture assay for the measurement of specific IgM against T gondii.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Detection of low copy human papilloma virus DNA and mRNA in routine paraffin sections of cervix by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In analysing human papilloma virus (HPV) infection of the cervix in formalin fixed paraffin sections by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation two main problems were found: detachment of sections from the glass during hybridisation and probe detection; inadequate sensitivity and inability to assess sensitivity of the in situ procedure. The first problem was investigated by assessing the efficiency of various tissue adhesives individually and in combination. The second problem was addressed by optimising conditions for DNA unmasking, hybridisation, and biotinylated probe detection. Sensitivity of the final in situ procedure developed was assessed by using the detection of pHY2.1 repeats as a built-in control. Extrapolation of data showed that less than 10 copies of HPV DNA can be visualised by these procedures. HPV nucleic acid, mainly in the form of DNA, was detected not only in koilocytic nuclei but also in suprabasal cells in condylomas and CIN lesions. HPV mRNA was also visualised in the cytoplasm (and probably also nuclei) of the same cell types. These non-isotopic in situ procedures give results comparable to those obtained with radiolabelled probes, but they are less time consuming and provide better morphological resolution.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Rapid technique of DNA-DNA in situ hybridisation on formalin fixed tissue sections using microwave irradiation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relative sensitivities of different protocols for detecting cytomegalovirus nucleic acid sequences in histological specimens, using a biotinylated cDNA probe, were assessed. Several commonly used pre-treatment steps were not essential, nor was the use of a highly sensitive detection system. The choice of enzyme used for proteolytic digestion of tissue seems to be important, and increasing the temperature of denaturation of tissue and probe DNA to above 100 degrees C greatly increased the sensitivity of the method. Difficulties in achieving such high temperatures in a controlled manner were overcome by the use of a rapid microwave heating method that can be used routinely in laboratories. This technique detected cytomegalovirus infections in formalin fixed, paraffin processed tissue sections within a single working day.</ABSTRACT>

The technique shows argyrophilic NOR associated proteins (AgNORs), which are seen in nuclei as black dots. Although the nuclei of melanocarcinoma in situ, melanocarcinoma per se, and lentigo maligna contained similar numbers of AgNORs, in melanocarcinomas a mean of 7.9 AgNORs per nucleus was found, while in naevocellular naevi, this figure was 1.2. The AgNOR method, which is unknown to most histopathologists, could perhaps be used quantitatively or semiquantitatively to assist in the diagnosis of melanotic lesions in the skin (and elsewhere).</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Forty primary carcinomas of the thyroid of different histological types were reviewed and studied histochemically, with the aim of identifying and assessing "mucin secretion". The patterns of extracellular "pure alcianophilia" and "mixed alcianophilia" were noted in 7.5% and about 50% of these tumours, respectively. A critical review of the pitfalls in methods and interpretation of mucin histochemistry--as performed in previously reported cases of "mucin secreting" or "mucinous" primary thyroid tumours--is presented. The apparent "mucin secretion" described in these unusual neoplasms could be due to histochemical staining of carbohydrate components or breakdown products of thyroglobulin and colloid.</ABSTRACT>

In just over 50% of the cases of fat necrosis the cause of death was categorised as sudden infant death syndrome, which also showed more severe degrees of necrosis. The mechanism of necrosis may be vascular hypoperfusion, possibly related to shock, and brown adipose tissue, on account of its high metabolic activity and rich capillary plexus, may be particularly vulnerable to infarction. The occurrence of fat necrosis in association with other causes of death did not provide any definite clue as to the nature of the alleged shock.</ABSTRACT>

Antithrombin III deficiency, which is known to be associated with recurrent venous thrombosis, was found in three patients. It is recommended that all patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis should be screened for antithrombin III deficiency as treatment with coumarin anticoagulants may be indicated, providing effective prophylaxis against further thrombotic episodes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Some long term effects of smoking on the haemostatic system: a report from the Caerphilly and Speedwell Collaborative Surveys.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Data from two community studies on men from South Wales and the west of England suggest that the effects of smoking on the haemostatic system remain for many years after giving up. Long term correlations between several variables, including plasma fibrinogen and white cell count, and the length of time after giving up were seen in ex-smokers. Dose response relations were apparent in current smokers in terms of the white cell count and two haematological variables, the packed and mean cell volumes. These long term correlations probably reflect the toxicity of other agents in tobacco smoke besides nicotine and carbon monoxide, which act only in the short term. Identification of these agents may further our understanding of the mechanism by which cigarette smoking is associated with atherosclerotic disease.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Investigations into the possibility that X (an antigen consistently present in aspirated odontogenic keratocysts, but not in most fluids from other cyst types), represented a keratinocyte component failed to identify the antigen as a keratin, involucrin, or one of the blood group substances. Antigen X was detected in human mixed and parotid saliva and in colostrum, as well as in a commercially obtained preparation of colostral IgA. The antigen was similar biochemically to both secretory component and lactoferrin but proved to be identical antigenically with lactoferrin. The origin of lactoferrin in keratocyst fluids remains uncertain, though the lining epithelium seems a more likely source than does the very variable, and often negligible, inflammatory infiltrate found in these lesions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Wandering fixed drug eruption: a mucocutaneous reaction to acetaminophen.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two patients are presented with a fixed drug eruption to acetaminophen characterized by recurring erythematous, circular plaques of the skin and oral mucosa along with multiple sites of deep (postinflammatory) hyperpigmentation clinically characteristic of fixed drug eruption. The involved sites did not necessarily flare with each exposure, nor did activity always appear in the same sites with each flare. Eventually some sites apparently became completely refractory. This caused the eruption to seem to "wander." Patch testing with 1% acetaminophen in alcohol (300 mg/30 ml alcohol) confirmed the causative agent in one patient. Although patch testing was negative in the other patient, oral reexposure caused a flare. Acetaminophen appears to be an uncommon cause of fixed drug eruption, with a tendency for lesions to appear at the same or at different sites in flares, perhaps because of a prolonged refractory period and the tendency to become completely refractory in some locations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption as a distinctive reaction pattern: examples caused by sensitivity to pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and tetrahydrozoline.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption is a distinctive, clinically recognizable entity. Characteristically, the lesions are large, symmetrical, well-circumscribed tender erythematous plaques that suddenly appear and reappear in exactly the same sites. They fade without pigmentation or any other trace over a 2- to 3-week period. Management requires recognition and avoidance of the responsible drug. Acute attacks may call for short-term systemic steroid therapy. Three examples of this overlooked reaction pattern are presented. The first case was associated with Night-Time cold formula and was proved by specific component challenge to be due to d-pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. The second case was due to PediaCare 3 Children's Cough Syrup, also containing d-pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. The third case was due to Visine eye drops, which contain an imidazole derivative, tetrahydrozoline. There is a need to increase our awareness that fixed drug eruptions come in two very different clinical forms: the classic pigmenting asymmetrical form, and the nonpigmenting symmetrical erythematous plaque form, in both of which the patient will give a history of the eruption being recurrent in the same area.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment of resistant severe psoriasis with systemic cyclosporine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four patients with severe psoriasis have been treated with oral cyclosporine for 6 months. Two had generalized erythroderma and two had extensive plaque-type psoriasis; all had either become unresponsive to or were unable to use other accepted treatments. All four patients responded rapidly and were completely clear of psoriasis within 3 weeks of beginning therapy. Initial doses ranged from 7.5 to 8.5 mg/kg/day. Mild reversible nephrotoxicity occurred in the one patient whose cyclosporine trough level briefly exceeded 200 ng/ml. Cyclosporine may offer an alternative therapeutic modality in the management of erythrodermic or severe resistant plaque-type psoriasis. The effectiveness of cyclosporine in psoriasis underscores the putative role of cell-mediated immune factors in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Incidence of congenital melanocytic nevi in newborn babies in Denmark.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three hundred fourteen unselected babies were examined within 96 hours of delivery. Three (1%) of the infants had clinically recognizable pigmented lesions. Two of the lesions (mean, 0.6%; range, 0.1%-2.3%; 95% confidence limits) proved histologically to be compound melanocytic nevi. The histology displayed almost identical patterns, with large nests of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction and only few nevus cells in the papillary dermis. A 0.6% incidence rate corresponds to 330 congenital melanocytic nevi in Denmark each year (range, 55-1265; 95% confidence limits). Because histology does not seem to be an accurate diagnostic tool to sort out the malignant potential of the small congenital melanocytic nevi, prospective studies are needed to characterize the premalignant melanocytic nevi, whether congenital or acquired.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Use of cyclophosphamide in azathioprine failures in pemphigus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four patients with pemphigus vulgaris are presented in which diagnosis was confirmed histologically and immunopathologically. Although these patients responded to high-dose prednisone therapy during the initial stages of acute disease, the addition of azathioprine failed to allow lower steroid doses and did not result in prolonged, complete remission. Indeed, the disease was exacerbated during azathioprine therapy, and significant side effects from prolonged high-dose steroid therapy were observed. Both clinical and serologic remission resulted from the addition of cyclophosphamide and dapsone to prednisone therapy. Thus, when azathioprine fails to produce remission or a steroid-sparing effect, cyclophosphamide may be an effective alternative. During a prolonged follow-up period, no recurrences of pemphigus have been observed, and no significant side effects of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) have been encountered. The addition of dapsone produced enhanced anti-inflammatory effects without increasing the existing or potential side effects of steroid therapy. Dapsone was easily withdrawn at the onset of remission. Thus the anti-inflammatory effect of dapsone may prove valuable in patients for whom steroids are contraindicated, who develop significant side effects during long-term steroid therapy, or for whom increases of dose threaten to enhance the possibility of catastrophic side effects.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A study of 121 melanoma patients and 139 control subjects from the University of California, San Francisco clinics was conducted among whites to examine the relationship between number of melanocytic nevi and cutaneous melanoma. Nevi that measured 2 mm or more in diameter were counted over the body by a dermatologist and a dermatology fellow. The average number of nondysplastic melanocytic nevi that were 2 mm or greater in diameter was 97 for melanoma patients and 36 for control subjects (p less than 0.001). Relative risks were 1.6 (p = 0.43) for 11 to 25 nevi, 4.4 (p = 0.01) for 26 to 50 nevi, 5.4 (p = 0.008) for 51 to 100 nevi, and 9.8 (p = 0.001) for more than 100 nondysplastic melanocytic nevi. Relative risks were 3.8 (p = 0.001) for 1 to 5 dysplastic nevi and 6.3 (p = 0.003) for 6 or more of these lesions. Report of blistering sunburns or of a previous skin cancer and having red or blond hair at the age of 20 were also independently associated with an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma. If confirmed in larger studies, the results presented on number of nevi and melanoma risk suggest a readily identifiable melanoma-prone group that could be followed to detect early malignant melanoma.</ABSTRACT>

Chromosomal aberrations include an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchange in cultured lymphocytes, a phenomenon pathognomonic for this disorder. These patients exhibit a great tendency for neoplasia, particularly acute leukemia and lymphoma. Three cases are reported, including a follow-up of a patient diagnosed 16 years ago.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and intradermal nevus: a combined malformation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied 13 desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas associated with intradermal nevi. Ten intradermal nevi were found among 76 new cases of desmoplastic trichoepithelioma (13%); three additional examples of the combined malformation were seen in consultation. Clinically, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma associated with an intradermal nevus was typically a small, firm or hard, sometimes annular, nodule on the face, particularly the cheek, of a relatively young woman. Microscopically, the combined malformation contained narrow strands of basaloid cells and keratinous cysts in a desmoplastic stroma, intimately mixed with intradermal nests of nevocytes. Melanocytic nevi have been associated with epidermal hyperplasia resembling seborrheic keratoses, follicular cysts, trichostasis spinulosa, syringomas, basal cell carcinomas, and hair follicle formation on the soles. The frequency of the occurrence of intradermal nevus with desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and the close anatomic association of the two elements may indicate that this combined malformation is another example of epithelial induction by melanocytic nevi.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fibrofolliculoma: solitary and multiple types.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Multiple skin tumors generally show autosomal dominant inheritance and are sometimes associated with other cutaneous and internal lesions. Solitary growths are typically nonhereditary and unassociated with other abnormalities. We found only two previous reports of solitary fibrofolliculoma and only one of multiple fibrofolliculomas without associated lesions; a few publications describe multiple fibrofolliculomas in patients with perifollicular fibromas, trichodiscomas, acrochordons, and connective tissue nevus. We studied five new cases of solitary nonhereditary fibrofolliculomas and one of multiple familial fibrofolliculomas without associated lesions. Clinically, fibrofolliculomas were typically small growths with a central dilated follicle containing horny material. Histologically, there was characteristically a hyperplastic follicular infundibulum with a central keratinous plug, and anastomosing strands of basaloid cells branching into an angiofibromatous stroma. Fibrofolliculoma is thus another skin tumor in which patients with multiple growths showing autosomal dominant inheritance sometimes have associated abnormalities, while solitary lesions with identical clinical and microscopic features are relatively trivial and nonhereditary.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of preoperative topical 5-fluorouracil in preparation for Mohs micrographic surgery of extramammary Paget's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The true extent of the skin affected in extramammary Paget's disease is frequently well beyond its clinical borders. A case of extramammary Paget's disease of the scrotum was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. Prior to surgery, 5-fluorouracil was applied topically for 10 days. This resulted in a sharply delineated, erythematous patch of biopsy-proved extramammary Paget's disease well beyond the original clinical borders. This increased the visible area of disease by 60%. Mohs micrographic surgery detected microscopic extramammary Paget's disease approximately 1 cm beyond the erythematous borders. The location of disease farthest from the margins was in the direction toward which this erythema was most advanced when the application of 5-fluorouracil was discontinued. At the time of writing, 3.5 years after treatment, the patient was free of disease. Topical 5-fluorouracil may have a role as an adjunct to surgery by highlighting subclinical areas of extramammary Paget's disease. It may also be useful postoperatively to detect early disease recurrence.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- An interdisciplinary approach to the management of basal cell carcinoma of the head and neck.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- At the University of Michigan the dermatologic surgeon works closely with the head and neck surgeon in resecting extensive cutaneous malignancies that could benefit from the combined skills of both surgical specialists. Mohs surgery offers complete microscopic controlled resection of the cutaneous portion of skin cancers. Tumors extending deeply from the skin into underlying bone and soft tissue are resected with the assistance of the head and neck surgeon familiar with the anatomy and trained in the protection of the vital structures of the head and neck. It is evident that patients with large or aggressive basal cell carcinomas will best be served when this interdisciplinary approach has become commonplace.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- "Clear cell" atypical fibroxanthoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An 87-year-old man with extensive solar damage presented with a 2-month history of a dome-shaped, crusted lesion on the dorsum of the left hand. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of fascicles of spindle cells with bizarre nuclei and clear, vacuolated cytoplasm. Histochemical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features supported the diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. The lesion was completely excised, and there has been no recurrence in 3 months of observation. This unusual "clear cell" variant of atypical fibroxanthoma must be distinguished from other clear cell tumors, such as metastatic renal cell carcinoma, clear cell eccrine carcinoma, and clear cell sarcoma (malignant melanoma) of soft parts. Although atypical fibroxanthoma is usually cured by complete surgical excision, metastases have been reported.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Noninvasive assessment of left ventricular diastolic function by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disease in which symptoms may frequently result from impaired left ventricular relaxation, filling and compliance. In the present investigation, Doppler echocardiography was utilized to measure transmitral flow velocity and thereby assess left ventricular diastolic performance noninvasively in a group of 111 patients representative of the broad clinical spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, all Doppler indexes of diastolic relaxation and filling differed significantly (p less than 0.001) from those obtained in 86 control subjects without heart disease, namely, prolongation of isovolumic relaxation (94 +/- 24 versus 78 +/- 12 ms) and of the early diastolic peak of flow velocity (244 +/- 55 versus 220 +/- 28 ms), as well as slower deceleration (3.4 +/- 1.4 versus 4.9 +/- 1.3 m/s2) and reduced maximal flow velocity in early diastole (0.5 +/- 0.2 versus 0.6 +/- 0.1 m/s). As an apparent compensation for impaired relaxation and early diastolic filling, the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling was increased, as shown by increased late diastolic flow velocity (0.4 +/- 0.3 versus 0.3 +/- 0.1 m/s) and reduced ratio of maximal flow velocity in early diastole to that in late diastole (1.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.9). The vast majority of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (91 [82%] of 111) showed evidence of impaired left ventricular diastolic performance, as assessed from the Doppler waveform. Abnormal Doppler diastolic indexes were identified with similar frequency in patients with (78%) or without (83%) left ventricular outflow obstruction, as well as in patients with (84%) or without (80%) cardiac symptoms. However, patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed more severe alterations in the Doppler indexes of diastolic function than did patients with obstruction. Thus, abnormal diastolic performance as assessed by Doppler echocardiography was apparent in the vast majority of the study patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, independent of the presence or absence of cardiac symptoms or a subaortic pressure gradient. The high frequency with which diastolic abnormalities are identified in asymptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggests that impaired diastolic performance may be present at a time in the natural history of the disease when functional limitation is not yet evident.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regional dysfunction by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography: a clinicopathologic study evaluating the relation of degree of dysfunction to the presence and extent of myocardial infarction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relation of degree of regional wall motion abnormality by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography to the presence and mural extent of regional necrosis or scar at autopsy was evaluated in 23 autopsy patients who had a history of myocardial infarction and had equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography within 40 days of death. Of the 228 regions evaluated by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, 135 had abnormal regional wall motion and 102 (76%) of these 135 regions had evidence of myocardial infarction at autopsy. The overall sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of regional wall motion abnormality for regional necrosis or scar were 69, 59 and 76%, respectively. Of the 33 false positive regions, 20 (61%) had severe narrowing of the coronary artery supplying that region, 13 (39%) were adjacent to a region with a myocardial infarction and almost half (16 [48%]) were in the lateral wall. Eighty-three (36%) of the 228 regions were akinetic or dyskinetic, 52 (23%) were hypokinetic and 93 (41%) were normal. Sixty-three (76%) of the 83 akinetic/dyskinetic segments had transmural myocardial infarction at autopsy, 14 (17%) had nontransmural myocardial infarction and only 6 (7%) contained no necrosis or scar. In contrast, 14 (27%) of 52 hypokinetic segments had transmural myocardial infarction, 11 (21%) had nontransmural myocardial infarction and 27 (52%) were normal. Thus, the most severe regional wall motion abnormality (akinesia/dyskinesia) almost always indicates regional myocardial infarction which is usually transmural whereas less severe dysfunction (hypokinesia) is not necessarily associated with regional necrosis or scar. The severity of regional dysfunction must be considered if equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography is used to evaluate the presence and mural extent of myocardial infarction within a region.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evaluation of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction during transient myocardial ischemia produced by angioplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Acute myocardial ischemia is known to cause impairment of both left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. To further investigate these changes as well as their relation to common clinical variables (electrocardiographic [ECG] changes and chest pain), 32 patients were evaluated with Doppler echocardiography during coronary angioplasty. Doppler indexes of left ventricular diastolic function included the ratios of peak early to late and peak early to mean diastolic velocities as well as the ratios of early to late and first third to total velocity integral (one-third filling fraction). All diastolic indexes showed significant impairment by 15 seconds after coronary occlusion (ratio peak early to late filling velocity: 1.11 versus 0.96, p less than 0.01; ratio peak early to mean filling velocity: 1.9 versus 1.7, p less than 0.01; ratio early to late velocity integral: 1.58 versus 1.25, p less than 0.01; one-third filling fraction: 41.2 versus 37.7, p less than 0.01). Left ventricular systolic function was evaluated during coronary occlusion both qualitatively, as assessed by the appearance of a new wall motion abnormality on two-dimensional echocardiography (mean 28.8 seconds), and quantitatively by measurement of systolic percent area change on the two-dimensional short-axis view as well as the Doppler echocardiographic stroke integral index. Systolic indexes did not show significant change until 30 seconds after balloon inflation (percent area change: 42.8 versus 29.2, p less than 0.01; stroke integral index: 11.04 versus 9.36, p less than 0.01). ECGs were performed at 15 second intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Silent ischemia predicts infarction and death during 2 year follow-up of unstable angina.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Silent myocardial ischemia as detected on Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is present in greater than 50% of patients with unstable angina despite intensive medical therapy. The presence and the extent of silent ischemia have been correlated with an increased risk of early (1 month) unfavorable outcome including myocardial infarction and need for coronary revascularization for persistent symptoms. Seventy patients with unstable angina who had undergone continuous ECG monitoring for silent ischemia were followed up for 2 years; 37 patients (Group I) had Holter ECG evidence of silent ischemia at bed rest in the coronary care unit during medical treatment with nitrates, beta-receptor blockers and calcium channel antagonists; the other 33 patients (Group II) had no ischemic ST segment changes (symptomatic or silent) on Holter monitoring. Over a 2 year follow-up period, myocardial infarction occurred in 10 patients in Group I (in 2 it was fatal) compared with one nonfatal infarction in Group II (p less than 0.01 by Kaplan-Meier analysis); revascularization with either coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty for symptomatic ischemia was performed in 11 Group I and 5 Group II patients (p less than 0.05). Multivariate Cox's hazard analysis demonstrated that the presence of silent ischemia was the best predictor of 2 year outcome. Therefore, persistent silent myocardial ischemia despite medical therapy in patients with unstable angina carries adverse prognostic implications that persist over a 2 year period.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inducible polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in a subgroup of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at high risk for sudden death.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This investigation was undertaken to elucidate the underlying electrophysiologic substrate in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and to identify possible predictors of sudden death in this patient population. Programmed stimulation was performed in 18 patients aged 14 to 64 years (mean 36) believed to be at high risk for sudden death on the basis of prior cardiac arrest or syncope, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring or a family history of frequent sudden death. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that deteriorated to ventricular fibrillation was reproducibly induced in 8 (44%) of the 18 patients (Group A). This rhythm was induced in all three patients with a history of cardiac arrest. No sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced. Group B comprised the 10 patients in whom a sustained arrhythmia could not be reproducibly initiated. The electrophysiologic substrate was distinctly different in patients with, than in those without, inducible sustained arrhythmia. The refractory period was shorter at the right ventricular outflow tract (232 +/- 22 ms) compared with the apex (264 +/- 12 ms) in Group A (p less than 0.005) whereas there was no difference in Group B (271 +/- 25 ms versus 271 +/- 13 ms). The local ventricular electrogram of most patients in both groups was prolonged and markedly multiphasic. However, 5 of the 8 Group A patients exhibited a double electrogram (V-V') with premature stimulation compared with 1 of the 10 patients in Group B (p less than 0.02). A positive R wave in lead aVR of the scalar ECG and poor R wave progression in the precordial leads were more common in Group A than in Group B (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.001, respectively). The reason for the distinctly different electrophysiologic substrate and the high prevalence of inducible polymorphic arrhythmia is unclear. It may relate to the underlying myocardial architecture in these patients, characterized by myocardial cellular disarray and fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Signal averaging of the surface QRS complex predicts inducibility of ventricular tachycardia in patients with syncope of unknown origin: a prospective study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Forty patients with syncope of unknown origin underwent quantitative signal averaging of the surface QRS complex before invasive electrophysiologic testing with programmed ventricular stimulation. Of 34 patients without bundle branch block, 12 had inducible ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 22 did not (Group II). The duration of low amplitude signals, the root mean square voltage of the terminal 40 ms and the signal-averaged QRS vector duration were measured in each case. One or more abnormal signal averaging variables were present in 92% of patients in Group I, but in only 27% of patients in Group II (p less than 0.005). An abnormal root mean square voltage of the terminal 40 ms was the most significant distinguishing variable, being present in 83% of Group I patients and in only 14% of Group II patients (p less than 0.005). The QRS vector duration was prolonged in 58% of Group I patients, but in only 9% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05). Likewise, the duration of low amplitude signals was prolonged in 58% of Group I patients, but in only 19% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05). When compared with 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, the presence of abnormal signal averaging variables was more predictive of inducible ventricular tachycardia. Seven (32%) Group II patients had greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature beats/h, couplets or episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; however, none had abnormal late potentials recorded. In contrast, three patients (25%) in Group I had less than 10 ventricular premature beats/h, although all in that group had one or more abnormal signal-averaged variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of 1.5 tesla nuclear magnetic resonance imaging scanner on implanted permanent pacemakers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Patients with a permanent pacemaker are currently restricted from diagnostic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging because of potential adverse effects on the pacemaker by the magnet. Previous work has shown that NMR imaging will result in asynchronous pacing of the pulse generator within a given distance of the magnet. The radiofrequency signal generated by the system may also result in rapid cardiac pacing, which may have deleterious effects. This study utilized a 1.5 tesla unit in an in vivo laboratory animal to evaluate the unit's effects on eight different pulse generators from two manufacturers. All pacemakers functioned in an asynchronous mode when placed within a certain distance of the magnet. In addition, transient reed switch inhibition was observed. Seven of the eight pulse generators paced rapidly when exposed to the radiofrequency signal and there was a dramatic decrease in arterial blood pressure. Whether effective rapid cardiac pacing would occur could not be predicted before exposure to the magnetic resonance unit. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging with high magnetic fields in patients with a pacemaker should continue to be avoided until the mechanism of the rapid cardiac pacing can be further delineated and either predicted or prevented.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Uses and limitations of exercise Doppler echocardiography in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study tested the hypothesis that coronary artery disease might be identified by a decrease in Doppler measurements of flow velocity and acceleration. The response of aortic blood flow velocity and acceleration to exercise was determined in 102 subjects (28 young control subjects and 74 older patients) who underwent continuous wave Doppler echocardiographic examination before, during and immediately after near maximal treadmill exercise. Patients were grouped according to the results of thallium perfusion imaging: Group I = normal, Group II = ischemia with or without prior infarction and Group III = prior infarction only. A significant decrease in the level of velocity and acceleration achieved with exercise was observed both in patients in Group I (normal thallium study) (1.2 +/- 0.3 m/s and 36.8 +/- 14 m/s per s, p less than or equal to 0.005) and in patients in Group II (ischemia) (1.1 +/- 0.3 m/s and 27.7 +/- 11 m/s per s, p less than or equal to 0.0005) compared with values in young control subjects (1.4 +/- 0.2 m/s and 52.7 +/- 16 m/s per s). When groups of patients of similar age who differed in the presence (Group II) or absence (Group I) of ischemia on thallium scintigraphy were compared, no difference was found for maximal velocity (1.1 +/- 0.3 versus 1.2 +/- 0.3 m/s, p = NS), but acceleration was significantly lower in Group II (27.7 +/- 11 versus 36.8 +/- 14 m/s per s, p less than or equal to 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of sampling site and flow area on cardiac output measurements by Doppler echocardiography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 40 patients cardiac output was simultaneously determined by pulsed Doppler echocardiography and thermodilution (range 4.0 to 10.2 liters/min). The sample volume was located in the center of the mitral anulus, at the tips of the mitral leaflets and in the center of the aortic anulus. Circular cross-sectional areas of the mitral anulus, aortic anulus and aortic bulbus were calculated from M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic diameters. The varying short axis of the elliptical mitral opening area was obtained from the diastolic leaflet separation in the M-mode, and the long axis was derived from the maximal mitral orifice area or mitral anulus diameter. Cardiac output was calculated by multiplying time-velocity integrals with the different areas and heart rate. Doppler flow measurements correlated significantly with the thermodilution method (r = 0.79 to 0.93). Flow measurements at the aortic anulus were most accurate (r = 0.93, SEE = 0.589 liter/min) if the annular area was derived from the M-mode tracing. Measurement of the anulus in the apical five chamber view yielded a significant underestimation and the area of the aortic bulbus provided an overestimation of cardiac output. Left ventricular inflow was underestimated at the mitral leaflet tips and overestimated at the mitral anulus. The accuracy of pulsed Doppler cardiac output measurements strongly depends on the assumed flow area and sampling site. Both should be determined at the same level in the inflow or outflow tract of the left ventricle. Measurement of cardiac output in the center of the aortic anulus provided the highest accuracy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mexiletine: an effective antiarrhythmic drug for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in congenital heart disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The use of antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress ventricular arrhythmias in pediatric patients with a structurally or hemodynamically abnormal heart appears to improve long-term prognosis. The previously successful use of phenytoin to treat serious ventricular arrhythmias led to the investigation for an alternative antiarrhythmic agent, in the same antiarrhythmic drug class, for those patients who develop side effects or become intolerant to phenytoin's antiarrhythmic effect. Forty-two children and young adults (age range 5 months to 34 years, mean 15.5 years) were treated with mexiletine. Arrhythmias treated were ventricular tachycardia (25), ventricular couplets (8), multiform ventricular premature beats (4) and frequent uniform ventricular premature beats (5). Anatomic diagnoses included congenital heart disease (postoperative in 26, unoperated in 2), cardiomyopathy (7), no heart disease (4) and other (3). Thirty-three patients had been previously treated with 1 to 5 (mean 1.6) antiarrhythmic drugs. In the short term, ventricular arrhythmias were effectively suppressed in 30 (71%) of all 42 patients treated. During follow-up (ranging to 42 months, median 10.6), 18 (60%) of the 30 acute responders continued to have excellent control. Early suppression of ventricular arrhythmias was more effective in patients with congenital heart disease (89%) than in those with cardiomyopathy (29%) or no heart disease (43%) (p less than 0.01). Initial complexity of ventricular ectopic activity had no effect on treatment results. Of 25 patients previously treated with phenytoin, in whom alternative antiarrhythmic therapy was required, 40% had long-term arrhythmia control when treated with mexiletine. Mexiletine therapy was terminated for side effects in only five patients (12%). Mexiletine is recommended for young patients with congenital heart disease and serious ventricular arrhythmias.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of a new second generation calcium channel blocker, nilvadipine (FR34235), on exercise-induced hemodynamic changes in stable angina pectoris.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The mechanism of the antianginal actions of nilvadipine was investigated in 11 patients with effort angina pectoris. Hemodynamic data were obtained by angina-limited supine multistage bicycle ergometer exercise testing before and after a single 6 mg dose of nilvadipine. Compared with chest pain during control exercise testing, pain at peak exercise disappeared or abated and the ST segment at peak exercise also showed less significant depression after administration of nilvadipine. At rest and at peak exercise, mean blood pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly, whereas heart rate and cardiac index increased significantly after nilvadipine. Rate-pressure product and stroke volume index did not change significantly. Coronary sinus flow at peak exercise increased significantly and total coronary vascular resistance at rest and at peak exercise decreased significantly after nilvadipine. The plasma concentrations of nilvadipine 1.5 hours after administration ranged from 1.15 to 8.23 ng/ml. These data suggest that the principal factors in the antianginal actions of nilvadipine are an increase in myocardial oxygen supply due to increased coronary blood flow and a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand mainly by a decrease in afterload and additionally by a decrease in preload.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Two-dimensional echocardiographic identification of complicated aortic root endocarditis: implications for surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two-dimensional echocardiography successfully displayed the location and extent of aortic root complications, annular abscess or mycotic aneurysm in nine patients with aortic valve endocarditis. Five of the nine patients had prosthetic valve endocarditis and four had native valve endocarditis. The infective process extended into the paravalvular structures, including the interventricular septum (seven patients), right ventricular outflow tract (three patients), interatrial septum (one patient) and anterior mitral valve leaflet (four patients). The amount of aorto-left ventricular discontinuity caused by these complications was quantitated in degrees of annular circumference on the parasternal short axis image and in distance on the parasternal long axis image. The echocardiographic findings were confirmed at surgery and were helpful in the preoperative anticipation of the type of surgical procedure required: aortic valve replacement or composite aortic valve and root replacement. Five patients had prosthetic valve endocarditis with calculated aorto-left ventricular discontinuity of 173 +/- 55 degrees on parasternal short axis images and 1.36 +/- 0.72 cm on parasternal long axis images. Initial surgical repair included three composite aortic root-valve prosthesis implants, one reconstructive procedure with valve replacement and one simple aortic valve replacement. During a follow-up period of 18 months (range 1 to 35), a second reparative procedure was required for only one patient to repair an aortic conduit to coronary artery venous bypass graft. Four patients had native valve endocarditis with calculated aorto-left ventricular discontinuity of 100 +/- 17 degrees on parasternal short axis images and 0.88 +/- 63 cm on parasternal long axis images. Initial surgical repair included two reconstructive procedures with valve replacement and two simple aortic valve replacements. During a follow-up period of 30 months (range 16 to 42), three of these four patients required a second reparative procedure: one each for repair of a paraprosthetic leak, a ventricular septal defect and persistent aorto-left ventricular discontinuity. Two-dimensional echocardiography accurately detected aortic annular abscess and mycotic aneurysm complicating aortic valve endocarditis and the resultant degree of aorto-left ventricular discontinuity. Circumferential aorto-left ventricular discontinuity with these complications is greater for prosthetic than native valve endocarditis and predicts a more extensive surgical repair.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A standardized examination in the interpretation of electrocardiograms.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A standardized objective examination was developed by the Cardiovascular Subspecialty Board of the American Board of Internal Medicine to assess competence in the interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs). The questions consisted of 12 lead ECGs with lead II and V1 rhythm strips, accompanied by brief clinical statements. Examinees chose their answers from a comprehensive list of 129 choices; the list was the same for each question. The score from the ECG examination was combined with scores from the other sections of the examination to derive a single score for the Cardiovascular Board examination using a norm-referenced method for determining the passing score. An additional trial was conducted to study the feasibility of testing for a minimal level of competence; the trial used a subset of "core" ECGs and a criterion-referenced scoring method based on a consensus of members of the Cardiovascular Board on the level of performance that should be expected of certified cardiologists. Fifty examinees (2.7%) failed the core ECG examination. If examinees had been required to pass both the core ECG examination and the remainder of the examination, 164 examinees (9%) would have changed their pass-fail status on the overall examination. The examination appeared to be a valid test for a minimal level of skill in this area of cardiology. The minimal level of competence was met by a large majority but not all of the examinees.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Selective perfusion of ischemic myocardium during coronary venous retroinjection: a study of the causative role of venoarterial and venoventricular pressure gradients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Coronary venous retroinjection is often associated with preferential distribution of flow to ischemic myocardium. The purpose of this study was to define the mechanism of such retrodistribution of flow. In 24 anesthetized open chest dogs, Monastral blue dye (10 ml) was injected by way of a balloon catheter in the distal great cardiac vein as a marker for retrograde flow distribution. The injection rate (0.6 to 2.4 ml/s) was adjusted such that systolic pressure in the anterior interventricular vein ranged between 60 and 85 mm Hg. In 11 dogs with no ischemia and normal myocardial perfusion pressure (96 +/- 8 mm Hg), no myocardial staining occurred despite retrograde filling of epicardial veins. One minute after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, dye injections caused selective staining of the cyanotic area in 15 of 18 episodes, sparing the normal myocardium within the zone of retroperfused veins. In five dogs, with the arterial pressure less than 55 mm Hg, retroinjection resulted in homogeneous staining of all the myocardium drained by the retroperfused veins. Selective staining of the ischemic myocardium caused by retroinjection was associated with the following pressure gradients: during systole from the anterior interventricular vein to the occluded coronary artery, 31 to 58 mm Hg, and during diastole from the retroperfused veins to the left ventricular chamber, 9 to 28 mm Hg. There was no diastolic venoarterial gradient in the ischemic myocardium. In normal myocardium, retroinjection did not reverse the arteriovenous pressure gradient. In conclusion, retrograde flow is primarily directed to myocardium with low anterograde perfusion pressure. Selective retrograde penetration of acutely ischemic myocardium can thus be achieved by a mechanism consistent with the development of venoarterial and venoventricular pressure gradients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Altered response of reperfused myocardium to repeated coronary occlusion in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- It is hypothesized that myocardium subjected to a 5 minute period of coronary occlusion and a 30 minute period of reperfusion has latent abnormalities that become overt when the reperfused myocardium is "challenged" by a subsequent coronary occlusion. This hypothesis is clinically relevant because reperfused myocardium is frequently subjected to recurrent ischemia, as in patients with unstable angina, vasospastic angina or recurrent thrombosis after initial coronary occlusion and thrombolysis. In 19 open chest dogs, the response of regional myocardial function to brief coronary occlusions was studied. Systolic wall thickening and diastolic thinning were measured using a specially developed miniature 5 MHz echocardiographic transducer fixed to the epicardium by suction. All 19 dogs underwent an initial "challenge" coronary occlusion (30 seconds). Thereafter, the control group (n = 8) underwent no intervention for 30 minutes, while the intervention group (n = 11) underwent 5 minutes of coronary occlusion followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. All dogs were then subjected to a second "challenge" coronary occlusion (30 seconds). In the control group, responses to the second challenge occlusion were the same as to the first occlusion. In the intervention group, regional and global systolic function and myocardial perfusion after the 5 minute coronary occlusion intervention returned to baseline levels, but the response to the second challenge coronary occlusion was significantly different in the intervention group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diltiazem and progression of myocardial ischemic damage during coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion in porcine hearts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study was designed to investigate whether a cardioprotective intervention could delay the completion of necrosis so that subsequent reperfusion would be more useful. Thirty-six pigs were randomly allocated to treatment with diltiazem (15 micrograms/kg per min) or saline solution and to a 60 or 120 minute coronary occlusion period followed by reperfusion. The treatment was begun 15 minutes before coronary occlusion and terminated 75 minutes after reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the heart was sliced and incubated in triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The infarct area and the maximal transmural area of extension of the infarct were calculated by planimetry. The total number of red blood cells in a transmural section was also counted. In the pigs with a 60 minute coronary occlusion, diltiazem (compared with saline solution) significantly reduced infarct size from 9.7 +/- 1.5% of left ventricular mass to 5.9 +/- 0.6% (p less than 0.05) and the percent transmural extension from 0.72 +/- 0.05 to 0.61 +/- 0.05% (p less than 0.05). Red blood cell extravasation in the infarcted area was reduced from 161,934 +/- 59,905 to 78,525 +/- 46,484 cells/mm3 (p less than 0.05) with diltiazem and the percent transmural extension of the hemorrhagic necrosis from 70 +/- 10 to 36 +/- 15% (p less than 0.05). No such differences were observed in the 120 minute coronary occlusion groups. Mean red blood cell counts and the extent of hemorrhagic necrosis did not correlate with either infarct size or transmural extension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Assessment of body fatness in childhood obesity: evaluation of laboratory and anthropometric techniques.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The identification of obesity as a pathological diagnosis depends on an accurate assessment of body fatness and a correlation of fatness with pathological consequences. Because total body fat varies with body weight, the proportion of body weight that is fat is probably a more reliable indicator of risk. Among obese children and adolescents, several problems have hindered the development of accurate clinical measures of percent body fat and total body fat. First, the use of direct methods to measure body composition is limited by expense and labor. Second, the relationship between anthropometric indexes and body composition in obese children and adolescents has not been intensively studied. Third, sample sizes of normal weight children have been too small to permit the development of diagnostic criteria. Fourth, the triceps skinfold is less reproducible in overweight subjects. Increases in lean body mass in obese adolescents may confound the use of the body mass index as a measure of adiposity. Current laboratory methods for the measurement of body composition include: (1) underwater weighing, (2) 40K counting, (3) isotopic dilution measures, (4) neutron activation, and (5) electrical impedance. This article examines relationships between those methods and anthropometry in the measurement of fatness in children and adolescents, as well as the difficulties in measuring body fatness and the importance of body fat distribution and its relationship to morbidity in children. Current evidence suggests an association of morbidity and upper segment obesity in adults. Corresponding studies in children and adolescents are yet to be carried out.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Meat fat madness: conflicting patterns of meat fat consumption and their public health implications.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- From 1979 to 1985, the University of Arizona's Household Refuse Analysis Project recorded packaging and food debris in household refuse to track the purchase of red meat and the discard of separable fat in sample neighborhoods with different income and age characteristics. From 1979 to 1982, the discard rate of meat fat remained relatively constant; in 1983, the rate of discard of meat fat nearly doubled and has remained stable in all neighborhoods measured. During the same period, the purchase of red meat with separable fat (steaks, roasts, and chops) declined, while the purchase of red meat with hidden, non-separable fat (hamburger, lunch meats, sausage, and bacon) held constant or increased. Thus, two "fat" trends have been identified at the household level: first, the purchase of less red meat with separable fat and the discard of a greater percentage of that fat, and second, the purchase of a greater percentage of red meat with substantial quantities of non-separable fat. Whether these seemingly contradictory choices are being made by a fully informed public is unclear. It is suggested that health promoters need to communicate the fat content of all types of red meat, especially those with hidden fat, more clearly.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Food, supplements, and fortified foods: scientific evaluations in regard to toxicology and nutrient bioavailability.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Food, supplements, and fortified foods can all be appropriate sources of nutrients. It is the responsibility of nutrition educators to help consumers use those nutrient sources appropriately. Consumers should consider at least six factors when they select foods, supplements, and fortified foods: flavor, convenience, cost, nutrient content, toxic factors, and bioavailability of nutrients. Consumers are often less concerned about the latter two factors than they should be. For example, many case histories have been published on the symptoms caused by overconsumption of vitamins A, B-6, C, and D and nicotinic acid. Generally those toxic symptoms were caused by the ingestion of supplements, not foods. Current widespread use of supplements containing one or two nutrients may not only cause overt toxicity symptoms but also adversely affect the bioavailability of other nutrients. For example, ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin C appears to interfere with copper metabolism in human subjects; ingestion of high levels of zinc impairs immune function, depresses copper absorption, and induces anemia; consumption of supplemental calcium as calcium phosphate dibasic is associated with renal calcification in rats; and ingestion of supplemental magnesium depresses the apparent absorption of calcium and retention of calcium in bone by rats.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Validity of a food frequency questionnaire and a food diary in a short-term recall situation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to compare intakes of eight nutrients computed from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and from 3-day food diaries with known values. Total food intake of 19 healthy adult volunteers (10 men and 9 women) was monitored for 2 weeks. Each week, subjects completed a 3-day diary and a 1-week FFQ. Subjects had previously completed one diary and one FFQ with respect to their usual diets. FFQs and diaries were analyzed for calories, protein, fat, cholesterol, calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C. All nutrients were underestimated by the FFQ (all p less than .05). Subjects omitted foods from the FFQ and incorrectly reported consumption frequencies. Vitamin A (p less than .001) and calories (p less than .05) were underestimated by the food diary. It is concluded that factors such as frequency of eating, pairing of foods, and explicitness of FFQ items affect recall accuracy. Those factors could influence the choice of FFQ design and administration.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role and nature of an interview in the selection of CUP applicants.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purposes of this research were to study the role of an interview in the selection of applicants in coordinated undergraduate programs (CUPs) in dietetics and to ascertain the nature of the interview in those programs in which it was used. A questionnaire sent to all CUP directors asked why they did or did not use an interview, the criteria used to determine which applicants would be interviewed, and the makeup of the interviewing team. Furthermore, the directors were asked to state the types of questions asked most frequently, the rationale for asking those questions, and the procedure used to evaluate applicants' responses. Finally, the directors were asked to rate the level of influence of selected factors that might be used in the decision regarding admission to CUP. The overall response rate was 81%. Results indicated that an interview is used in 80% of the programs. Difficulty in scheduling and in achieving a standardized method of evaluating an interview were the most frequently cited reasons for not using one. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents ranked an interview as high in influencing the decision regarding admission to CUP. In contrast, 90% of the respondents ranked completion of prerequisite courses and 86% ranked overall GPA as highly influential factors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Validation of the 24-hour dietary recall in preschool children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The results of the current study indicate that data obtained by the dietary recall correlate highly with the children's weighed food intake if a parent or the primary caretaker providing the child's food responds to the interview. Meredith et al. found parents to be poor reporters of children's consumption outside the home. It is encouraging to note that parents can be reliable reporters of their children's food intake in the home environment. When errors did occur, they were errors in portion size, as 96% of foods eaten by the children were correctly identified by the parents. Parents under-reported only 4% of the time. This slight tendency to under-report is consistent with other reports of the validity of the 24-hour dietary recall. In younger children, parents appear to be reliable reporters of their children's in-home dietary intake. As children become older, they appear to be able to recall their own intake both within and outside the home. There are several possible explanations for these findings. First, several factors could have influenced the accuracy of parental reports of the child's intake during the day that we weighed foods. Because food was weighed in the homes, the parents undoubtedly attended more closely to their child's diet. Additionally, the dietary recalls were collected at the end of the day of observation. This was closer in time than most 24-hour recalls and may have reflected less memory decay than usual. Also, since our sample was primarily middle-class families who were well educated, the correspondence between actual vs. reported dietary intake may have been artificially enhanced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acute transmural myocardial infarction in elderly patients hospitalized in the coronary care unit versus the general medical ward.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The hospital records of 126 patients over 75 years of age with transmural myocardial infarction initially treated in the coronary care unit were compared with a concurrent similar group of 94 patients admitted directly to the general medical wards. The in-hospital mortality rate for both groups together was 40%. The mortality rate within the coronary care unit was 24% as compared with 46% in the ward group (P less than 0.005). However, the mortality rate for the coronary care unit group as a whole (including those patients later transferred to the general ward) was 35 versus 46% in the ward group. Congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock were the most frequent complications in both groups (47 and 30%, respectively), and they were the main cause of death. Patients with these complications were less likely to be successfully resuscitated, even in the coronary care unit. The overall incidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias and complete heart block was similar to that reported for younger patients. Eleven patients in the coronary care unit group were successfully resuscitated from these arrhythmias and eight survived to be discharged from hospital. In contrast, only two patients in the ward group were successfully resuscitated and eight (9%) patients died suddenly and the fatal event could not be diagnosed. We concluded that elderly patients with an acute myocardial infarction can benefit from early admission to a coronary care unit.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Epidemiology of depression and dysphoria in an elderly Hispanic population. Prevalence and correlates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Depression among older minority groups, including Hispanics, has not been well studied. Little is known of the true rates of depression, it correlates or how well it is treated. This research is part of a series examining health status of older Hispanics using the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Evaluation (CARE). Seven hundred older Hispanics living in Los Angeles County were studied using an area-probability sampling method. The CARE items were regrouped to reflect Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III criteria for depression and dysphoria. More than 26% were found to have a major depression or dysphoria. These affective disorders were strongly correlated with physical health status. Without physical health complications, the rate was 5.5%. A number of socioeconomic, health behavior, and family variables were related to affective state. Treatment for affective disorder appeared to be very poor for this population.</ABSTRACT>

- Patients admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service were screened to identify middle-aged (35 to 50 years of age) and elderly (60 years of age and over) patients suffering from a major depressive episode with melancholia. Thirty-seven subjects (18 middle-aged and 19 elderly) were identified. Criteria symptoms for depression and symptoms specifically associated with melancholic or endogenous depression did not differ across age groups, with few exceptions. Major depression with melancholia in this hospitalized population was symptomatically similar in the middle-aged and elderly. The syndrome is therefore relatively common on this inpatient service and should be easily recognized.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Urinary incontinence in elderly women: clinical findings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two-hundred women self-described as having urinary incontinence, aged 55 to 90 years and living in the community completed a comprehensive history and physical examination. Initial presentation of urine loss was most commonly stress incontinence symptoms (35%). Scoring of peak response to volume lost and frequency revealed urine loss necessitating a clothing change for 78% and daily loss experienced by 73%. Over half had experienced a urine loss problem for more than five years. Most (65%) had sought treatment, but a minority reported current (11%) or previous (36%) treatment. Thirty-six percent were found to have severe atrophic vaginitis with severe urethocele (10%), cystocele (13%), rectocele (12%) less common. Pelvic floor strength by clinical scoring was weak (mean, 1.05 on a 5-point scale). The vaginal electromyograph first contraction peak mean was 5.94 microvolts sustained at 50% or better for 3.92 seconds. Clinical criteria established that 66% had stress, 27% a mixture of stress and urge, only 4% pure urge incontinence, and 4% other.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Urinary incontinence in elderly women: urodynamic evaluation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The objective of this study is to characterize urinary incontinence observed in elderly women and to assess the importance of various parameters used to evaluate urinary incontinence. Two hundred consecutive, ambulatory, outpatient, incontinent women 55 years of age and over who were seen at the Continence Program Clinic and completed a medical and urodynamic protocol are included in this paper. After a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination, urodynamic tests were performed. The urodynamic results showed that 77% of incontinent women had an incompetent urethra. Twenty-five percent had a hyperactive bladder, 8% had "other" types, and 7% had a normal study. Comparison of the clinical diagnosis with the actual urodynamic diagnosis for stress incontinence revealed a 78% accuracy and only a 6% false negative. In contrast, a similar comparison for urge incontinence found only 44% accurate and 45% false negative. Analysis of the urodynamic tests revealed that the simple provocative full-bladder stress test was as effective as the radiographic or electronic pressure measurement in detecting incompetent urethra producing stress urinary incontinence. Provocative upright cystometry was helpful in uncovering 33% of hyperactive bladders not provoked in the supine position. Complex urodynamic tests should be reserved for unexplained incontinence or when symptomatology is complex.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sucralfate versus cimetidine in reflux esophagitis. A single-blind multicenter study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A single-blind randomized multicenter study was performed in 42 patients with endoscopically documented reflux esophagitis. Patients were randomly given 400 mg cimetidine q.i.d. or a suspension of 1 g sucralfate q.i.d. for a period of 8 weeks. Forty patients were evaluated after 8 weeks. Symptomatic improvement was good and was comparable in both groups. We saw side-effects in only three patients, two on sucralfate and one on cimetidine, and these did not necessitate withdrawal from the study. Endoscopy showed improvement of esophagitis in 53% and healing in 31% of patients after sucralfate treatment. With cimetidine, improvement was seen in 67% and healing in 14%. One patient on cimetidine developed a stricture during treatment. We conclude that treatment with sucralfate improves symptoms and lessens severity of reflux esophagitis and that the results with sucralfate appear to be comparable to those obtained with cimetidine. Sucralfate is a valid alternative to H2-receptor antagonist therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Self-rating of pain in nonulcer dyspepsia. A methodological study comparing a new fixed-point scale and the visual analogue scale.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Little attention has been paid to methodological aspects in the recording of gastrointestinal symptoms. We compared a new fixed-point scale for the self-recording of pain intensity with steps operationally linked to behavioral events and with additional monitoring of pain duration--termed the "duration-intensity-behavior scale" (DIBS)--with the visual analogue scale (VAS) in 32 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. After randomization, the patients either recorded pain intensity (VAS) or pain intensity and duration (DIBS) four times daily during a 4-week period for 1 preliminary week without medication, followed by 3 weeks of antacid treatment. For both scales there was a high degree of compliance, and they seemed equally reliable and sensitive to changes in pain experience. Since DIBS yields more clinically useful information, this scale appears to be preferable for the monitoring of gastrointestinal pain.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Indium-111 leukocyte scanning of the abdomen. Analysis of its value for diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Indium-111 leukocyte scanning of the abdomen (IAS) was performed in 10 patients with ulcerative colitis and in 39 patients with Crohn's disease involving the small intestine (in 25 occasions) and/or the colon (17 cases). Radionuclide uptake by the gut was seen in 84% of the patients with active inflammation. We compared the extent of the disease displayed by IAS with the findings obtained by either radiological or endoscopic studies or at surgery. In two-thirds of the patients, the IAS gave an accurate evaluation of the extent of the disease (sensitivity 68%). False-positive IASs were not seen in small bowel disease (specificity 100%), but were observed on 4 occasions on the colon (specificity 86%). The intensity of the radionuclide uptake could not be correlated with the clinical activity of the disease as evaluated by the Crohn's disease activity index. These results suggest that IAS is not superior to the standard procedures used to detect and localize inflammatory bowel disease and that IAS cannot replace these techniques. However, the simplicity of IAS and the complete lack of complications associated with its use render it useful in the evaluation of the extent and distribution of inflammation in some patients, mainly those with severe disease in whom standard diagnostic procedures would be contraindicated.</ABSTRACT>

Three patients had mild, rapidly resolving abnormalities of liver biochemistry and serum amylase. In the other five, both serum amylase and liver biochemistry were repeatedly normal. We conclude that endoscopic retrograde cholangiography may be useful in the detection of small gallstones in patients with symptoms suggestive of biliary tract disease, even in the presence of normal oral cholecystography, ultrasonography, serum amylase, and liver biochemistry.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We looked at laxative consumption and its relationship to bowel habits, total gastrointestinal transit time (TGITT), and symptoms in patients with chronic nonorganic constipation. Of the patients, 87.9% used laxative, 30% habitually. Laxative intake increased with age, so that habitual consumption was more frequent in patients with long-standing (greater than 10 years) constipation. Although habitual laxative users had a consistent trend toward lower bowel frequency and prolonged TGITT, no relationship was found among intake and observed bowel frequency, TGITT, or large bowel segmental transit time. Although laxatives induced more satisfactory or less difficult evacuations, they also caused diarrhea and mucus in the stool. Laxative consumption did not bring about any detectable improvement in the abdominal or extraabdominal symptoms usually associated with constipation.</ABSTRACT>

- Four patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and Sjogren's syndrome presented with pulmonary disease manifested by fever, cough, and dyspnea. One patient had obstructive lung disease secondary to an autoimmune process documented by immunofluorescent staining of lung parenchyma. The other three patients had interstitial lung disease, pulmonary nodules, and multiple granulomas of the lung, respectively. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a complex autoimmune syndrome involving a disorder of the secretory immune system and its epithelial end organs. These four cases suggest that, in addition to biliary, lacrimal, intestinal, renal tubular, and salivary epithelium, lung tissue also is a possible site for autoimmune involvement in PBC.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Liver sinusoids and sinusoidal cells in patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The origin of sinusoidal portal hypertension often remains unknown in patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. Four consecutive patients with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia had liver biopsies examined under light and electron microscopy. Two of the four had obvious clinical portal hypertension; of these two, only one had portal vein thrombosis. All four cases showed sinusoidal infiltration by myeloid cells (from very mild to obvious) and an increased perisinusoidal collagen network. Under electron microscopy we observed (a) the collagenization of the Disse space, (b) myeloid cells in the lumen and the Disse space, (c) the transformation of perisinusoidal cells into transitional cells, and (d) fragments of basement membrane-like material. It is possible that all these abnormalities, and not only sinusoidal infiltration, contribute to increase vascular resistance, even when there is no clinical evidence of portal hypertension unrelated to vascular thrombosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The primary role of murine bone marrow in the production of natural killer cells. A cytokinetic study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The normal steady state production of natural killer (NK) cells in the bone marrow and spleen was characterized with cytokinetic technics. We developed a protocol to enrich for NK cells in bone marrow and demonstrate that target binding can be used as a criterion for marrow NK cells if nonspecifically "sticky" cells are eliminated. The selected population of B cell-depleted bone marrow lymphoid cells was comprised mainly of lymphocytes, of which 80% were NK-1.1+. B cell-depleted bone marrow lymphocytes that bound to YAC-1 could be characterized as two populations on the basis of morphology and proliferative status: large, proliferating target-binding cells (TBC), of which 25% were in S phase of the mitotic cycle, and small postmitotic TBC. Pulse and chase studies indicated that the small TBC in bone marrow were derived from an immediate proliferating precursor, presumably the large TBC, which were, in turn, derived from a precursor population that was more rapidly proliferating. In contrast, few if any splenic TBC were labeled after a 30-min pulse with [3H]TdR and significant numbers of labeled TBC did not appear in the spleen until 2 or more days after the pulse label. Surprisingly, some of the splenic TBC were relatively long lived and survived 2 mo or longer. These studies are the first to directly characterize the production of NK cells in situ in normal marrow. We demonstrate that the marrow is the primary site of production of NK cells and that little, if any, proliferation of NK cells occurs in the periphery of unstimulated mice. The data suggest the existence in the bone marrow of at least three compartments in the NK lineage: a rapidly proliferating NK precursor population, a less rapidly proliferating population of large TBC, and a population of small postmitotic TBC.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prominent IgM rheumatoid factor production by human cord blood lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We previously reported that Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) is a potent stimulant of IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) production by normal adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the current study, we compared the capacity of normal adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cord blood mononuclear cells to produce IgM RF. Although both populations of cells consistently produced IgM RF in response to SAC, the quantity of RF produced by cord blood cells (128 +/- 18 ng/ml, mean +/- SEM) greatly exceeded that of adult cells (37 +/- 5 ng/ml, p less than 0.0005) even though both populations of cells demonstrated comparable total IgM responses. Remarkably, 16.7% of total IgM produced by cord blood cells in response to SAC showed RF activity compared to only 3.4% (p less than 0.0001) of the total IgM produced by SAC-stimulated adult cells. Thus, precursors of IgM RF-secreting cells are not only a consistent feature of the normal adult human B cell repertoire, but they are especially represented at the time of birth. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IgM RF originates from germ line genes and underscore the utility of SAC as a probe for analyzing the production of this autoantibody.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Products of activated lymphocytes and macrophages inhibit mouse embryo development in vitro.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of activated leukocyte products on embryonic development were assessed by adding mouse and human leukocyte culture supernatants and purified murine and human lymphokines and monokines to mouse embryos in tissue culture. Supernatants from mitogen-stimulated and mixed lymphocyte cultures arrested embryonic development at the two-cell to morula stage. Of a panel of six individual lymphokines and monokines tested for effects in this system, both murine and human forms of the lymphokines colony-stimulating factor, interferon-gamma, and human B cell growth factor significantly arrested embryonic development over a wide concentration range. The monokines, interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor, also had significant effects but only at high doses. These results indicate that products of activated lymphocytes and macrophages can have detrimental effects on preimplantation embryos. Early abortion could result from local (intrauterine) production of such embryotoxic factors by activated lymphocytes and macrophages in response to stimulation by microorganisms or reproductive tissue antigens.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Primary cultures of murine astrocytes produce C3 and factor B, two components of the alternative pathway of complement activation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have investigated the production of C3, C4, and factor B complement components in primary cultures of murine astrocytes and in clonal cell lines belonging to the astrocytic lineage by immunoprecipitation of secreted labeled polypeptides. Although C4 has not been detected, C3 appeared to be constitutively synthesized both by two transformed astroblastic cell lines and by astrocytes in primary cultures. In contrast, factor B was only secreted upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation both in astroglial primary cultures and in an immortalized astrocytic cell line. The eventual physiologic relevance of an endogenous brain production of components of the alternative pathway of complement activation is discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Monoclonal antibodies to adenosine receptor by an auto-anti-idiotypic approach.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Monoclonal antiadenosine receptor antibodies have been raised by an auto-anti-idiotypic approach. BALB/c mice were immunized with adenosine 6-aminocaproyl-bovine serum albumin. Hybridoma cell lines were raised and lines that secreted antibodies that bound to rabbit antiadenosine antibodies were obtained. Two such monoclonal antibodies, AA18 and AA21, were studied in detail and found to be directed at adenosine receptors by the following criteria. They inhibited the binding of [3H] adenosine to rabbit antiadenosine antibodies that had binding characteristics similar to those of adenosine receptors. They bound to rat brain membranes and binding could be inhibited by N6-cyclohexyladenosine and L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, both adenosine receptor agonists. They also inhibited the binding of [3H]L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine to rat brain membranes. In functional assays, they inhibited adenylate cyclase of rat brain membranes, but had no effect on adenylate cyclase of rat hepatic membranes, indicating that they mimic agonists of the A1 receptor, therefore, carrying an "internal image" of the adenosine molecule. When adenosine receptors of rat brain membranes were solubilized with 1% cholic acid, partially purified on an adenosine 6-aminocaproyl AH-Sepharose column and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, both AA18 and AA21 recognized a 62,000 band under nonreducing conditions, and a major band of 36,000 under reducing conditions. We conclude that the auto-anti-idiotypic route has yielded specific antibodies that recognize the A1 adenosine receptor.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Complete variable region sequences of five homologous high affinity anti-digoxin antibodies.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- High affinity murine A/J anti-digoxin monoclonal antibodies exhibit diversity in binding specificity for structurally related cardiac glycosides. They utilize several VH and VL genes. Among this diverse set, however, five antibodies share V region amino-terminal sequences that are remarkably homologous. The five antibodies were divided into three subsets based on different fine specificity-binding patterns. Therefore, complete V region sequences were determined by Edman degradation and by nucleotide sequence analysis. The VH region homology among the five antibodies was 84 to 100% and the VL region homology was 89 to 99%. The sequence data are consistent with the use of single (or closely related) VH and VL genes encoding the five antibodies. Four antibodies, derived from the same fusion (40-40, 40-120, 40-140, and 40-160), use identical D, JH2, and JK5 gene segments and identical junctions suggesting that they are clonally related. The fifth antibody (35-20) uses different D and JH1 gene segments but the same JK5 gene segment. All five antibodies share a cross-reactive idiotype. The three antibodies that exhibit the greatest degree of homology (40-40, 40-120, and 40-140) also share indistinguishable antigen-binding patterns as well as private idiotopes not present on the other two antibodies. Antibody 40-160, which has the next most homologous sequence, shares idiotopes with the first set but binds preferentially to different sites on the hapten, whereas antibody 35-20 has the most divergent sequence. In general, the degree of sequence homology among the five antibodies correlates with their hierarchical order based on hapten and idiotype fine specificity patterns.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Immunosuppression by activated human neutrophils. Dependence on the myeloperoxidase system.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An in vitro model system was used to define the mechanism of interaction between human neutrophils and lymphocytes. Blood mononuclear leukocytes were exposed to purified neutrophils in the presence of a neutrophil-activating agent (phorbol ester, lectin, or opsonized particle). The treated mononuclear cells displayed a marked decrease in both natural killer activity and mitogen-dependent DNA synthesis, but no change in viability. This functional suppression was dependent on neutrophil number, stimulus concentration, and duration of exposure. Lymphocytes were protected by addition of catalase, but not superoxide dismutase. Neutrophils defective in oxidative metabolism (chronic granulomatous disease) failed to suppress lymphocyte function unless an H2O2-generating system, glucose oxidase plus glucose, was added. The patients' neutrophils provided a factor, possibly myeloperoxidase, which interacted with the glucose oxidase system. The immunosuppressive effect of normal neutrophils was diminished when chloride was omitted from the cultures and was enhanced when chloride was replaced by iodide. Myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils were partially defective in suppressing lymphocytes and this was corrected by addition of purified myeloperoxidase. Paradoxically, azide caused enhancement of suppression that depended on the neutrophil oxidative burst, but not on myeloperoxidase and was mediated at least in part by an effect of azide on the target mononuclear leukocytes. These data indicate that suppression of lymphocyte function by activated neutrophils is mediated by the secretion of myeloperoxidase and H2O2 that react with halides to form immunosuppressive products. Moreover, the mononuclear leukocytes contain an azide-sensitive factor, probably catalase, which provides partial protection against injury by neutrophil products. These dynamic interactions may be important local determinants of the immune response.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- 125I-fibrin deposition in IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity reactions in mouse skin. Demonstration of the role of mast cells using genetically mast cell-deficient mice locally reconstituted with cultured mast cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We investigated the clotting associated with IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the mouse by injecting monoclonal mouse anti-dintrophenyl IgE antibodies i.d. and, the next day, administering 125I-guinea pig fibrinogen i.v. 10 to 30 min before i.v. antigen (2,4-dinitrophenylated human serum albumin) challenge. In normal mice, 2-hr passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reactions were associated with substantial leakage of 125I-fibrinogen and deposition of 125I-fibrin. Thus, ears injected with IgE contained up to six times the total cpm of 125I and up to 30 times the cross-linked 125I-fibrin-associated cpm of 125I than did control ears. Several lines of evidence indicated that the 125I-fibrin deposition associated with the PCA reactions was dependent on the activity of mast cells: 1) Mast cell degranulation occurred at sites of PCA reactions. 2) Antigen-induced influx of 125I-fibrinogen and deposition of 125I-fibrin were virtually abolished by heating the IgE (56 degrees C, 1 hr) before i.d. injection. 3) Little or no IgE-dependent 125I-fibrinogen influx or 125I-fibrin deposition occurred in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv or WCB6F1-S1/S1d mice X 4) Adoptive transfer of cutaneous mast cell populations into WBB6F1-W/Wv mice (by each of three approaches: i.v. transplantation of normal bone marrow cells or local i.d. injection of cultured, growth factor-dependent mast cells 2 days or 9 to 10 wk before antigen challenge) conferred on the recipients the ability to express the 125I-fibrinogen influx and 125I-fibrin deposition associated with PCA reactions. These data demonstrate that 125I-fibrinogen influx and 125I-fibrin deposition occurs in association with PCA reactions in the mouse, and that the reaction is largely or entirely dependent on the function of cutaneous mast cells. The experiments also demonstrate the utility of a novel model system for the analysis of mast cell function in vivo: WBB6F1-W/Wv mice locally reconstituted with mast cells by the injection of mast cell populations generated in vitro.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A monoclonal antibody raised to tumor-specific T cell-derived suppressor factors also recognizes T suppressor inducer factors of the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl hapten suppressor network.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A monoclonal antibody (mAb), B16G, was raised from BALB/c mice immunized with affinity-purified T suppressor factors (TsF) specific for the murine mastocytoma P815. This mAb was found to bind to polyclonal TsF isolated from the spleens of tumor-bearing animals, and to the TsF released from a P815-specific T cell hybridoma. In this study, B16G was tested for its reactivity with TsF produced in the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl hapten system. The factors from three types of suppressor T cell hybridomas, each representing the immortalized analogues of the inducer T suppressor cell (Ts1), transducer suppressor cell (Ts2), and effector suppressor cell (Ts3) network populations, were tested. B16G was found to be reactive with two sources of TsF1 as assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and delayed-type hypersensitivity bioassay. By contrast, TsF2 and TsF3 were nonreactive with B16G. These results indicate that B16G recognizes class-specific suppressor factor determinants, and that the transducer/effector factors of the network are apparently serologically distinct. Because the B16G mAb fails to recognize 4-hydroxy-3-nitro-phenyl acetyl-specific TsF3 that share idiotype-related determinants with TsF1 yet binds to TsF1 molecules that have interacted with antigen, the binding is apparently independent of the site of antigen recognition. Additionally, the results show that the tumor-specific TsF1 raised in one suppressor system share serologic determinants with anti-hapten TsF1 raised in another.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Immunoglobulin chain recombination among antidigoxin antibodies by hybridoma-hybridoma fusion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Conditions necessary for in vitro chain recombination of high affinity (10(9) to 10(12) M-1) antidigoxin monoclonal antibodies resulted in decreased affinity for both intact "native" and chain recombinant molecules. Chain recombination by somatic cell fusion was used instead to study the effects on antigen specificity and idiotypy of recombinants in which an homologous light (L) chain substituted for the parental L chain. The antidigoxin antibody 26-10 utilizes a VL sequence highly homologous to that of antibody 40-20, an antidigoxin antibody which uses a different VH gene than does 26-10 and lacks significant reactivity with an anti-26-10 idiotypic serum. The drug-marked antidigoxin cell line 26-10 (gamma 2a, kappa) and a drug-marked light chain producing variant of antidigoxin hybridoma 45-20 (lambda 1) which lacks both digoxin binding and idiotypy were fused. The fusion progeny (gamma 2a, kappa, lambda 1) which binds digoxin and is idiotype-positive, was selected for kappa loss (resulting in loss of digoxin and idiotype binding) and then fused with a heavy (H) chain loss variant of antidigoxin hybridoma 40-20 (kappa, digoxin nonbinding, idiotype negative). The resultant cell line CR-57 (gamma 2a, kappa, lambda) secretes antibodies which assemble the 26-10 H chain with both the 40-20 kappa-chain and the 45-20 lambda 1-chain. The affinity purified recombinant species consisting of 26-10 H chain and 40-20 kappa-chain expresses complete 26-10 idiotypic determinants. However, this recombinant antibody binds digoxin with decreased affinity and altered specificity relative to native 26-10. The binding specificity pattern nonetheless is most similar to the H chain donor. Amino acid and nucleotide sequence analyses of the respective light chains demonstrate six variable region differences between them, two of which are in complementarity-determining regions and the remainder in the framework. Hybridoma-hybridoma fusion provides an alternative to in vitro chain recombination for studying the contribution of chain combinational diversity to antibody diversity, antigen binding, and idiotypy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Detection and partial characterization of a human mast cell carboxypeptidase.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Using a high performance liquid chromatography assay that detects the cleavage of the C-terminal leucine from angiotensin I, we have identified a carboxypeptidase activity in mast cells from human lung and in dispersed mast cell preparations from human skin. The enzyme activity was detected in a preparation of dispersed human mast cells from lung of greater than 99% purity and was released with histamine after stimulation with goat anti-human IgE. In nine preparations of dispersed human mast cells from lung of 10 to 99% purity, net percentage of release of carboxypeptidase correlated with the release of histamine, localizing carboxypeptidase to mast cell secretory granules. The enzyme activity was also detected in preparations of dispersed human mast cells from skin and in extracts of whole skin. The inhibitor profile and m.w. of carboxypeptidase activity from preparations of dispersed mast cells from skin was similar to that from dispersed mast cells from lung. Mast cell carboxypeptidase had a m.w. on gel filtration of 30,000 to 35,000. The enzyme in crude lysates of dispersed mast cell preparations had optimal activity between pH 8.5 and 9.5 and was inhibited by potato inhibitor, which distinguished it from carboxypeptidase in cultured human foreskin keratinocytes and adult fibroblasts, and from other proteolytic mast cell enzymes. The enzyme activity was also inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline, and, to a small extent, by 8-OH quinoline, but not by Captopril, soybean trypsin inhibitor, or pepstatin. These findings demonstrate that human mast cell secretory granules contain carboxypeptidase in addition to tryptase and chymase. It appears that mast cells from skin may have a higher content of carboxypeptidase than do mast cells from lung.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Activation of plasma Hageman factor and kallikrein in ongoing allergic reactions in the skin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ten atopic subjects, sensitive to intradermal injection of less than or equal to 10 protein nitrogen units of ragweed or grass pollen antigen, underwent paired antigen and buffer skin chamber incubation over the base of denuded skin blisters. The chamber fluids were sampled over a 6-hr period for histamine and activated Hageman factor and plasma kallikrein which were complexed to C1 inhibitor. In 9 of 10 subjects significantly (p less than 0.01) increased histamine levels (74 +/- 11 ng/ml vs 1.5 +/- 0.55 ng/ml) and kallikrein-C1 inhibitor complexes (2.15 +/- 0.78 ng/ml/hr vs 0.51 +/- 0.09 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.25) were detected at antigen sites compared with buffer sites, respectively. Increased levels of activated Hageman factor (ng/ml/hr) were detected at antigen sites (1.35 +/- 0.60) compared with buffer sites (0.11 +/- 0.05), (p less than 0.01), in 8 of 10 subjects. Whereas peak levels of histamine were obtained after 1 hr of challenge, both Hageman factor and kallikrein activation, as assessed by complex formation, tended to peak later from the 2nd to the 5th hr. This represents the first demonstration that cutaneous IgE-mediated allergic responses are associated with local activation of the intrinsic plasma coagulation-kinin pathways.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibition of monocyte oxidative responses by Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Bordetella pertussis and the other Bordetella species produce a novel adenylate cyclase toxin which enters target cells to catalyze the production of supraphysiologic levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In these studies, dialyzed extracts from B. pertussis containing the adenylate cyclase toxin, a partially purified preparation of adenylate cyclase toxin, and extracts from transposon Tn5 mutants of B. pertussis lacking the adenylate cyclase toxin, were used to assess the effects of adenylate cyclase toxin on human peripheral blood monocyte activities. Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence of monocytes stimulated with opsonized zymosan was inhibited greater than 96% by exposure to adenylate cyclase toxin-containing extract, but not by extracts from adenylate cyclase toxin-deficient mutants. The chemiluminescence responses to particulate (opsonized zymosan, Leishmania donovani, and Staphylococcus aureus) and soluble (phorbol myristate acetate) stimuli were inhibited equivalently. The superoxide anion generation elicited by opsonized zymosan was inhibited 92% whereas that produced by phorbol myristate acetate was inhibited only 32% by B. pertussis extract. Inhibition of oxidative activity was associated with a greater than 500-fold increase in monocyte cAMP levels, but treated monocytes remained viable as assessed by their ability to exclude trypan blue and continued to ingest particulate stimuli. The major role of the adenylate cyclase toxin in the inhibition of monocyte oxidative responses was demonstrated by: 1) little or no inhibition by extracts from B. pertussis mutants lacking adenylate cyclase toxin; 2) high level inhibition with extract from B. parapertussis, a related species lacking pertussis toxin; and 3) a reciprocal relationship between monocyte cAMP levels and inhibition of opsonized zymosan-induced chemiluminescence using both crude extract and partially purified adenylate cyclase toxin. Pertussis toxin, which has been shown to inhibit phagocyte responses to some stimuli by a cAMP-independent mechanism, had only a small (less than 20%) inhibitory effect when added at concentrations up to 100-fold in excess of those present in B. pertussis extract. These data provide strong support for the hypothesis that B. pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin can increase cAMP levels in monocytes without compromising target cell viability or impairing ingestion of particles and that the resultant accumulated cAMP is responsible for the inhibition of oxidative responses to a variety of stimuli.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cooperation between CD16(Leu-11b)+ NK cells and HLA-DR+ cells in natural killing of herpesvirus-infected fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We reported previously that natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis of cytomegalovirus-infected targets requires the presence of HLA-DR+ nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (NPBMC). In the present study we determined whether NK cell-mediated lysis of other herpesvirus-infected targets also requires HLA-DR+ cells. Depletion of either cluster designation (CD)16+ NK cells or HLA-DR+ cells from NPBMC significantly reduced their ability to lyse herpes simplex virus (HSV)- and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-infected fibroblasts. When CD16- and HLA-DR- populations were mixed, lysis of both HSV- and VZV-infected targets was virtually completely restored, indicating that NK cells and HLA-DR+ cells were required for lysis to occur. Cell-free supernatants, obtained by incubating NPBMC or CD16- cells with HSV-o-VZV-infected targets, contained antiviral activity and stimulated HLA-DR-cells to mediate lysis of corresponding virus-infected targets. The addition of anti-interferon-alpha to supernatants abolished their ability to stimulate lysis. Thus, secretion of interferon-alpha by HLA-DR+ cells contributes to NK cell-mediated lysis of herpesvirus-infected targets.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- In vitro production of cholera toxin-like activity by Plesiomonas shigelloides.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although Plesiomonas shigelloides is considered to cause diarrhea in humans, the mechanisms by which it might do so are not known. Enteric pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and some strains of Escherichia coli produce enterotoxins that activate adenylate cyclase, increase production of cyclic AMP, and thereby cause elongation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in tissue culture. We grew 28 strains of P. shigelloides and the type strain in an iron-depleted medium, and sterile filtrates were examined in CHO cell culture. Filtrates from 24 of the 29 strains produced elongation of CHO cells. These changes could be prevented by heating or by preincubation of the filtrate with cholera antitoxin. These data indicate that P. shigelloides elaborates a cholera-like toxin; such a substance might be important in the pathogenesis of P. shigelloides-associated diarrhea.</ABSTRACT>

- During 1984 we conducted a population-based survey of culture-confirmed invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae among persons who lived in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metropolitan area (population, 846,000) through the 20 clinical laboratories in the area. There were 139 residents identified with invasive pneumococcal disease (11 with meningitis and 128 with other bacteremic infections), for an infection rate of 16.4 per 100,000 population (meningitis, 1.3 cases per 100,000; other bacteremias, 15.1 cases per 100,000). Cases peaked in January-May and December (75% of cases). Rates were highest among infants less than 12 months old (97 cases per 100,000) and persons greater than or equal to 80 years old (87 cases per 100,000). Seventeen (12.2%) of the pneumococcal isolates were relatively penicillin resistant. These isolates were most prevalent among elderly persons greater than or equal to 70 years old (six [17.6%] of 34) and young children 0-4 years old (7 [15.9%] of 44) compared with persons 5-69 years old (four [6.6%] of 61).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Enzymatic modification of glycocalyx in the treatment of experimental endocarditis due to viridans streptococci.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The presence of abundant surface polysaccharide, or glycocalyx, on viridans streptococci has been associated with failure to eradicate the organism from experimental cardiac vegetations during penicillin treatment. The role of glycocalyx in retarding sterilization was tested by in vivo administration of dextranase, an endohydrolase that attacks internally situated alpha (1-6) linkages. Dextranase and penicillin, either singly or in combination, were used to treat experimental endocarditis. After two days of therapy, 100% of animals treated with penicillin or dextranase alone had infected vegetations, whereas only 25% treated with penicillin and dextranase had infected vegetations (P less than .01). After five days of therapy, 100% of the animals treated with penicillin had infected vegetations, versus none that were treated with penicillin and dextranase (P less than .01). We conclude that glycocalyx acts to retard antibiotic activity in vegetations and that partial enzymatic digestion of the glycocalyx facilitates penicillin sterilization of the infected valve.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We used three related strains of Staphylococcus aureus to determine whether capsule size influenced bacterial virulence. Strain SA1 mucoid elaborated a large capsule demonstrable by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Nonmucoid isolates were derived from strain SA1 mucoid by Tn551 insertional mutagenesis. By TEM, strain JL24 produced a "microcapsule," whereas strain JL25 was unencapsulated. Strain SA1 mucoid had a 50% lethal dose for mice greater than 3,000-fold lower than that of strains JL24 and JL25. Quantitative cultures of blood and kidney from animals challenged intravenously revealed that strain SA1 mucoid was cleared less readily from the bloodstream and kidneys than the nonmucoid mutants. In an in vitro assay, only strain SA1 mucoid demonstrated antibody-dependent, complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis by human leukocytes. Strains JL24 and JL25 were opsonized for phagocytosis by complement alone. Thus a highly encapsulated strain of S. aureus was more virulent in mice than two related nonmucoid strains. The microencapsulated mutant was not more virulent than the unencapsulated mutant.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Isolation of a 220-kilodalton protein with lectin properties from a virulent strain of Entamoeba histolytica.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 220-kilodalton (kDa) protein with lectin properties was isolated from Entamoeba histolytica strain HM1:IMSS and was purified by Sepharose 4B chromatography and electroelution from 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein contains 9% carbohydrate by weight; is rich in hydrophobic residues; and is very immunogenic in mice, hamsters, and rabbits. The protein binds to fixed monolayers of MDCK cells and inhibits trophozoite attachment to the cultured cells. The 220-kDa protein agglutinates human erythrocytes, and agglutination is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of hyaluronic acid, chitin, chitin-derived products (chitotriose), and antibodies to the purified protein. The 220-kDa protein is recognized by an antibody to the membrane but not by antibodies to other subcellular fractions. We therefore suggest that this 220-kDa protein with lectin properties is a component of the plasma membrane and could be one of the putative "receptor" molecules involved in cell and/or matrix attachment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antigenic relationships between human caliciviruses and Norwalk virus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We investigated antigenic relationships between human calicivirus (HCV) strains and Norwalk virus by using immune electron microscopy (IEM) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Three serologically distinct HCV strains, UK1, UK2, and Japan, were demonstrated by IEM, as was evidence for two additional strains, UK3 and UK4. Although HCV strains and Norwalk virus were distinct by IEM, 12 of 20 patients with gastroenteritis due to HCV UK4 and two of eight with gastroenteritis due to UK2 showed seroconversions to Norwalk virus by RIA. These naturally occurring antibody responses in humans, as detected by RIA, support the concept that Norwalk virus belongs to the family Caliciviridae. An RIA for HCV Japan antigen also detected HCV UK1, UK2, and UK4 and thus appears to identify a group-specific antigen for these viruses. An RIA for antibody to HCV Japan failed to identify seroconversions in 45 of 47 patients with gastroenteritis due to HCV UK. These results may reflect different reactivities of various immunologic tests for the identification of infections due to small gastroenteritis viruses.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antigenic variation in rabies and rabies-related viruses: cross-protection independent of glycoprotein-mediated virus-neutralizing antibody.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Immunization experiments with vaccines prepared from the PM and ERA strains of rabies virus demonstrated that in mice, only ERA vaccine primes for an anamnestic response to the rabies-related strain Duvenhage (DUV6); in rabbits, both ERA and PM vaccines induced immunologic memory to DUV6 virus. In mice, ERA vaccine, but not an equal concentration of PM vaccine, conferred protection against a lethal challenge infection with DUV6 virus. This result indicated that the protective activity correlated with the vaccine's ability to induce immunologic memory. A vaccine prepared from a sequentially selected, neutralization-resistant, multiple-variant virus conferred protection against challenge with the parental strain, a result indicating that antigenic variation of the glycoprotein may not be the sole factor in determining the relative efficacy of rabies prophylaxis. We found no correlation between titers of neutralizing antibody and mortality rates in mice immunized with purified glycoprotein from these viruses.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Absorption of biliary calcium from the canine gallbladder: protection against the formation of calcium-containing gallstones.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Calcium salts are the major components of pigment gallstones. The calcium species in bile that is critical for Ca++ precipitation is free ionized calcium, [Ca++]. Factors that regulate biliary [Ca++] in bile are therefore of great importance in the pathogenesis of pigment gallstones. The fate of biliary Ca++ on entry into the gallbladder has not previously been studied. We here report that a minimum of 51.3% +/- 8.8% (SEM) of Ca++ is absorbed from the canine gallbladder on concentration of bile during a 24-hour fast. In addition, there was absorption of least 70.9% +/- 6.2% of Na+, 56.5% +/- 8.6% of K+, and nearly all (greater than 98%) of Cl-. Absorption, neutralization, or both, of HCO3- was also nearly complete (greater than 98%). During concentration of bile by the gallbladder, the concentrations of all biliary cations increased as total bile salt concentration increased, whereas anion concentrations declined. These results are consistent with a Gibbs-Donnan effect induced by impermeable, negatively charged bile salt molecules. Comparison of bile/plasma [Ca++] ratios with those for [K+], a passively distributed ion, was also consistent with, although not proof of, the passive absorption and distribution of Ca++ across the gallbladder epithelium. The absorption of Ca++ by the gallbladder may be a factor in the prevention of pigment gallstones, because it limits free Ca++ ion in bile, and thus decreases the likelihood of precipitation of calcium.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Partial aortic ligation: a hypoperfusion model of ischemic acute renal failure and a comparison with renal artery occlusion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) in humans typically results from hypoperfusion, not total blood flow interruption. However, experimental studies of ischemic ARF have relied on total blood flow cessation models because no reliable hypoperfusion model has been described. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a hypoperfusion model of ischemic ARF and then to contrast it to a blood flow cessation model (renal artery occlusion). Rats were uninephrectomized, and then temporary (30 or 45 minute) partial aortic ligation (PAL) was created just above the left renal artery, yielding a renal perfusion pressure of 15 to 20 mm Hg and a renal blood flow of 0.1 to 0.2 ml/min. The severity of renal injury was assessed 24 hours later. Azotemia (30-minute PAL: BUN 47 +/- 5 mg/dl; 45-minute PAL: 118 +/- 11 mg/dl), depressed inulin clearances, and extensive pars recta proximal tubular necrosis resulted. Comparing 30 minutes of PAL with 30 minutes of renal artery occlusion revealed far less severe ischemic adenosine triphosphate depletion (P less than 0.001), less azotemia (P less than 0.05), less medullary vascular congestion (P less than 0.05), and less cast formation (P less than 0.05) with PAL. However, both models induced comparable degrees of tubular necrosis, oxidant tissue stress (as assessed by oxidized-reduced glutathione tissue assay), and post-ischemic adenosine triphosphate depletion. Both similarities and differences exist between hypoperfusion and blood flow cessation-induced experimental ARF. The difference indicate that blood flow cessation models may not closely simulate clinical ischemic renal injury.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role for intrarenal adenosine in the renal hemodynamic response to contrast media.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The intrarenal injection of contrast media results in a transient fall in renal blood flow (RBF) and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These effects are enhanced by dietary sodium restriction and attenuated by sodium loading. A similar sodium-dependent response of RBF and GFR occurs with the intrarenal injection of adenosine. In view of these similarities, we sought to determine whether endogenous adenosine is involved in the renal hemodynamic response to contrast media. The intrarenal injection of contrast media (meglumine-Na diatrizoate, 76%) in six sodium-depleted, anesthetized dogs resulted in a 17% +/- 4% decrease in RBF and a 31% +/- 5% decrease in GFR. The infusion of the adenosine receptor antagonist, theophylline (5 mumol/min), reduced the decrease in RBF to 6% +/- 2% and in GFR to 12% +/- 3% of control values. During the intrarenal infusion of dipyridamole (24 micrograms/kg/min), a potentiator of adenosine through its action to inhibit the cellular uptake of nucleosides, the hemodynamic response to contrast media was greater; RBF fell 25% +/- 4% and GFR fell 44% +/- 7%. In addition, the urinary excretion of endogenous adenosine increased after the injection of contrast media (388 +/- 79 vs. 830 +/- 231 nmol/min). In summary, the contrast media-induced fall in RBF and GFR was attenuated by theophylline and augmented by dipyridamole, and the administration of contrast media resulted in an increase in the excretion of endogenous adenosine. These results support the hypothesis that endogenous adenosine is involved in the renal hemodynamic response to contrast media.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of magnesium salt anions on potassium balance in normal and magnesium-depleted rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Potassium depletion often accompanies clinically significant magnesium depletion, and magnesium replacement is most frequently undertaken with magnesium sulfate. However, inorganic sulfate acts as a nonreabsorbable anion in the distal nephron, an effect that could potentially interfere with the correction of any associated potassium deficiency. We have investigated the effect of a variety of magnesium salts, including sulfate and nonsulfate forms, on cation balance and skeletal muscle ion composition in normal and magnesium-depleted rats. Even modest amounts of dietary sulfate increased the urinary excretion of potassium in both normal and magnesium-depleted rats. During a 7-day feeding period, diets containing MgSO4 or MgO with an equivalent amount of Na2SO4 resulted in significantly greater urinary excretion of potassium than diets without sulfate. In normal animals, this kaliuresis did not produce hypokalemia or muscle potassium depletion. Magnesium-deficient feeding produced magnesium depletion, kaliuresis, and a decline in both plasma and muscle potassium content. When magnesium was restored to the diet without sulfate, urinary potassium excretion decreased, and both magnesium and potassium deficits were corrected. However, when magnesium refeeding included sulfate salts, magnesium stores returned to normal, whereas the kaliuresis and potassium depletion persisted. When accompanied by a high sodium intake, the kaliuretic effect of sulfate was increased.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Small intestinal regulation of iron absorption in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ultrastructural, biochemical, and immunologic studies of the small intestinal mucosa of rats were undertaken to investigate factors associated with the regulation of iron absorption. The quantity of iron within mucosal cells was proportionate to the degree of iron repletion. Although the quantity of iron-binding substances was similar in iron-deficient and iron-loaded animals, the unsaturated iron-binding capacity of mucosal cells varied inversely with the state of iron repletion of animals in ultrastructural, biochemical, and immunologic observations. Although only certain mucosal cells contained iron-binding substances, their number was not increased in iron-deficient animals. Greater quantities of iron and iron-binding substances were observed in duodenal mucosa than in ileal mucosa. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the quantity of unsaturated iron-binding substances within intestinal mucosal cells regulates iron absorption. These findings are only partially explained by changes observed in the concentration of ferritin and transferrin within intestinal mucosa and suggest that other iron-binding substances may also participate in the regulation of iron absorption.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of human sex hormones on cytomegalovirus growth and Fc receptor expression.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pretreatment of human embryonic lung cells with estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone was found to have little effect on cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication in vitro. The three hormones in combination delayed the expression of CMV-induced Fc receptors in this cell line. However, similar effects on Fc receptor expression were observed at both first trimester and third trimester concentrations of the hormones. CMV grew well in a primary cell line derived from endometrial stromal cells. However, in this female genital line, as in the (male somatic) human embryonic lung cells, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone had little effect on CMV replication. CMV-induced Fc receptors could not be demonstrated in endometrial stromal cells. These results suggest that the variation in cervical CMV excretion during gestation is mediated by some mechanism other than a direct effect of sex hormones on viral replication or Fc receptor expression.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Synergism between Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus in experimental tibial osteomyelitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We explored the potential role of microbial synergy in an experimental rat osteomyelitis model. Osteomyelitis was assessed by gross pathologic conditions and quantitative cultivation of rat tibiae for the implanted organisms 21 days after challenge. When Staphylococcus aureus was used alone, the 50% infective dose (ID50) and the 100% infective dose (ID100) were 400 and 25,000 colony-forming units (CFU), respectively. When Bacteroides fragilis was inoculated alone, the ID50 was 150,000 organisms, and the ID100 was not confidently determined. Subinfectious numbers of B. fragilis added to the staphylococcal inocula yielded an ID100 as low as 20 staphylococci. Mixed inocula with 20 or 200 staphylococci and increasing numbers of B. fragilis yielded a dose-dependent increase in the number of staphylococci isolated from osteomyelitic tibiae. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the two inocula and their interaction to be significantly predictive of the 21-day quantitative assessment of staphylococci (r = 0.80). Synergy was most striking at low bacterial inocula. When even large numbers of S. aureus were added to B. fragilis, the B. fragilis inoculum required to initiate B. fragilis osteomyelitis was essentially unchanged. We conclude that small numbers of B. fragilis allow remarkably low numbers of S. aureus (20 or 200 CFU) to establish osteomyelitis in the rat.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- High-performance liquid chromatographic characterization of neurophysins in chronic renal failure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Levels of immunoreactive (IR) oxytocin (OT)-associated or estrogen-stimulated neurophysin (ESN) and vasopressin-associated or nicotine-stimulated neurophysin (NSN) were measured in plasma of patients with chronic renal failure before and after hemodialysis (HD) and intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD), and during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). ESN-IR in 17 patients before HD was 24.4 +/- 2.7 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) and increased after HD to 33.2 +/- 4.1 ng/ml (P less than 0.001). ESN-IR in 17 patients with CAPD was 15.2 +/- 3.4 ng/ml, significantly lower than in patients undergoing HD, P less than 0.001. In patients receiving IPD (n = 6), ESN was 11.6 +/- 3.7 ng/ml and did not change significantly after IPD. Levels of ESN in patients with renal failure were increased compared with levels in normal individuals, 1.0 +/- 0.1 ng/ml. Levels of ESN were not correlated with laboratory parameters that may be abnormal in renal failure. NSN levels in 16 of 17 patients undergoing HD were 3.2 +/- 0.34 ng/ml and in 14 of 17 patients with CAPD were 2.9 +/- 0.4 ng/ml, respectively. ESN before HD (r = 0.63, P less than 0.01), after HD (r = 0.85, P less than 0.001), and in patients with CAPD (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001) and IPD (r = 0.81, P less than 0.05) correlated significantly with an OT-like peptide previously found to be increased in renal failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Systems of membranes involved in peritoneal dialysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To evaluate whether the viscera contribute to the system of membranes used in peritoneal dialysis, dialysis rate studies were performed comparing control rats (n = 9, mean peritoneal area 509 +/- 38 cm2) with eviscerated rats (n = 12, mean peritoneal area 200 +/- 123 cm2). The mass transfer coefficient (MTC) and absorption from the peritoneal cavity were calculated for urea, creatinine, and inulin, which had been added to commercially available 1.5% hydrous dextrose dialysate. Rates of peritoneal blood flow to the peritoneal membranes remaining after evisceration were similar for both groups. Urea, creatinine, glucose, and inulin were used as markers to compare control and eviscerated animals. The MTC results were (in milliliters per minute, mean +/- SEM): urea 3.0 +/- 0.3, 4.1 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01); creatinine 1.4 +/- 0.2, 2.0 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.05); glucose 1.2 +/- 0.3, 1.7 +/- 0.2 (P less than 0.09); inulin 0.3 +/- 0.02, 0.6 +/- 0.1 (P less than 0.01); and MTC inulin/MTC urea 0.16 +/- 0.01, 0.14 +/- 0.01. Absorption of urea, creatinine, glucose, and inulin from the peritoneal cavity was only 10% to 23% greater among control animals. Whether the results were caused by nonparticipation of the intestinal viscera or other mechanisms, such as improved contact between dialysate and membrane, awaits further study.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Flow dependence of vasopressin-stimulated hydraulic conductivity in rabbit collecting tubule.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Flow rate dependence of both electrolyte and nonelectrolyte transport in various nephron segments has been described. Prior studies have used relatively leaky epithelia in which the flow rate-dependent transport phenomena can be explained in terms of alterations in axial and radial concentration profiles. In this study, the flow rate dependence of either vasopressin or cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated water flux (Jv), hydraulic conductivity (Lp), and osmotic permeability (Pf) were measured in isolated perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules. Increasing perfusion rate from 6.0 +/- 0.4 to 20.7 +/- 1.2 nl/min results in highly significant increases in Jv (131%) and in Lp and Pf (120%). In this relatively tight epithelium, osmotic equilibrium did not occur. Although the mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated, the present results mandate maintenance of constant flow rates when examining the perfused cortical collecting tubular response to vasopressin.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hypercalcemia can potentiate the nephrotoxicity of Bence Jones proteins.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hypercalcemia is frequently observed in patients with multiple myeloma and renal failure. Whether Bence Jones protein (BJP) is directly nephrotoxic and how and whether hypercalcemia might contribute to this putative nephrotoxicity is currently unclear. To examine this issue, we studied the effect of modest hypercalcemia on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of rats exposed to a BJP that by itself had been found to be nonnephrotoxic. Three groups of rats were studied. All were anesthetized and underwent a baseline measurement of inulin clearance (Cin). After this, group 1 (n = 13) rats were given 2 ml of vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline solution [PBS]) and were then made hypercalcemic with an infusion containing 0.048 mol/L CaCl2. At the end of 2 hours a second Cin was measured. Group 2 rats (n = 8) were given 100 mg BJP in 2 ml PBS and a non-calcium-containing infusate. Group 3 (n = 11) rats were given 100 mg of the BJP in 2 ml PBS and then the calcium-containing infusate used in group 1 rats. Rats in groups 2 and 3 also had a second Cin measured at the end of 2 hours. Renal blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe. At the completion of the second clearance, kidneys were processed for renal histologic assessment. The serum calcium level measured during the second Cin period was 13.5 mg/dl for group 1, 7.9 mg/dl for group 2, and 13.7 mg/dl for group 3. No significant decrement in GFR was observed in group 1 or 2 rats. In contrast, group 3 rats had a 46% fall in GFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of porphyrins on proteins of cytosol and plasma. In vitro photo-oxidation and cross-linking of proteins by naturally occurring and synthetic porphyrins.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We examined the photodynamic effects of porphyrins, known photosensitizers, on proteins of cytosol and plasma that bind them and are implicated in their transport. Their susceptibility to photodecomposition by porphyrins was found to be higher than that of proteins with low or no affinity for tetrapyrroles. Inhibition of porphyrin binding by the addition of equimolar amounts of heme had no effect, indicating that protein photodecomposition may be induced, in part, by free or nonspecifically bound porphyrins. HBP, a heme-binding Z protein of liver cytosol, exhibited the highest susceptibility of all proteins tested, including glutathione S-transferases, albumin, hemopexin, and apotransferrin. HBP was extensively photo-oxidized, as evidenced by a decrease in its antigenicity and electrophoretic mobility, and it was cross-linked by naturally occurring porphyrins as well as by the synthetic tin-protoporphyrin and hematoporphyrin derivative. The water-soluble singlet oxygen scavengers L-histidine (50 mmol/L) and sodium azide (100 mmol/L) completely prevented the photodynamic effects of uroporphyrin (100 mumol/L) on HBP. Hydroxyl radical scavengers such as manitol and benzoate were partially effective, whereas water-insoluble singlet oxygen scavengers such as beta-carotene were totally ineffective. Preferential inhibition of cross-linking over other photodynamic effects of uroporphyrin was consistent with previous reports that cross-linking occurs subsequently to amino acid oxidation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evaluation of a filter aspiration technique to determine membrane deformability.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A filter aspiration technique for the measurement of red cell membrane deformability described by Brailsford et al. (Blood Cells 1977;3:25) was evaluated. Pore diameters of 0.6 and 1.0 micron were used. Portions of red cells were aspirated with various hydrostatic pressures between 1 and 9 mm H2O. After fixation the filter was removed and the length and radius of the pressure-induced tongues measured by scanning electron microscopy. One to several tongues per cell were observed. The number of tongues had no influence on the measurements at pressures less than or equal to 7 mm H2O. The elastic modulus of the red cell membrane was calculated; it yielded 2.9 (+/- 0.4) X 10(-3) dynes/cm. Data obtained with filter aspiration were compared with the results obtained concurrently with the micropipette technique. A good correlation was found for normal red cells (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001). Stomatocytes produced by chlorpromazine in vitro had an increased elastic modulus with both methods. For echinocytes produced by salicylate or adenosine triphosphate depletion, the elastic modulus as determined by filter aspiration was normal, but the modulus as measured by micropipette aspiration was increased. Possible reasons for the difference are discussed. We conclude that the filter aspiration is a valid technique to measure elastic properties of red cell membranes, except when there are surface irregularities, such as those in the echinocytes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Identical complement concentrations in blood obtained from central venous catheters, arterial lines, and antecubital phlebotomy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In vitro complement activation has been detected during passage of blood through tubing used in hemodialysis and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, in addition to tubing being investigated for vascular grafts. Because tubing from arterial lines and central venous catheters are composed of similar materials and are used when blood is withdrawn from patients for complement assays, a study was undertaken to assess the degree of complement activation in blood obtained from these sites. Complement activation was determined by a terminal complement complex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), C1rC1s-C1 inhibitor complex ELISA, and 50% complement hemolytic activity (CH50) assay. Blood simultaneously obtained from the arterial lines and central venous catheters had identical terminal complement complex, C1rC1s-C1 inhibitor complex, and CH50 levels when compared with blood withdrawn by antecubital phlebotomy. Because blood may be obtained from the arterial lines and central venous catheters for complement assays, the pain and possible bruising from antecubital phlebotomy could be eliminated. Furthermore, blood may now be withdrawn from indwelling catheters without fear of in vitro complement activation causing a misinterpretation of results.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of Otosporin and Gentisone HC on the mitotic index and thickness of the tympanic membrane and meatal skin in the guinea pig.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Otosporin and Gentisone HC ear drops were inserted twice daily for 3 weeks into the external auditory meatuses of guinea pigs. An intraperitoneal injection of vincristine (1 mg/kg.) was given to each animal three hours before it was killed. Temporal bones and attached external auditory meatuses were dissected, tissues were fixed in 10 per cent buffered formalin, decalcified in EDTA, and embedded in JB4 plastic for sectioning at 4 micron. The proliferative activity in the epidermis of the bony meatus and in the lateral surface of the tympanic membrane was obtained by deriving the mitotic indices. After both types of ear drops there was a statistically significant reduction in mitotic indices, the values being about half the control values. The proliferative activity in the tympanic membrane was too low to permit statistical analysis, but no differences were apparent between the groups. The thicknesses of the epidermis and dermis of the bony canal, and of the tympanic membrane, were measured using a Kontron MOP-AMO3 analyser. Although the dermis was thinner as a result of the administration of ear drops, both the epidermis of the bony meatus and that of the tympanic membrane were thicker, all these changes being statistically significant.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- In the newer surgical procedures for fistula speech, finger occlusion of the tracheostoma is mandatory for speech production. This can be embarrassing as it draws attention to the patient's stoma. Finger occlusion is unhygienic and at times inconvenient. A new tracheostoma valve has been designed to eliminate the need for finger occlusion for speech. It has been evaluated clinically in nine laryngectomees, all of whom retained a good objective quality of speech similar to that obtained by finger occlusion. Vocal efficiency measurements with the valve are very encouraging. The valve is simple to use, of universal size, self-retaining, does not need any skin cleansing and obviates the need for skin adhesives to hold the valve in place.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reduction of adverse drug reactions by computerized drug interaction screening.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Computerized drug-interaction screening systems (CDISS) have been developed as a tool to help decrease the enormous morbidity and expense related to adverse drug interactions. In previous studies the CDISS was used primarily by pharmacists in hospital settings to screen for interactions after the prescription had been written. This study tests the feasibility of family physicians using CDISS before writing the prescription to allow for changes in the prescription while the patient is still in the office. In a 30-day period, 103 patients were screened by family physicians for potential drug-drug, drug-alcohol, and drug-food interactions. Potential drug interactions of varying clinical significance were detected for 71 patients (68.9 percent). The prescription plan was changed for 16 patients (15.5 percent) as a result of using the CDISS. Participating physicians reported that they gained new information in 45.8 percent of the patient encounters, that their awareness of the potential for drug interactions was heightened by participation in this study, and that their exposure to the CDISS was worthwhile as an educational tool. While a few problems, mainly logistic, were noted with the CDISS as used in this study, the authors conclude that with modifications a CDISS can be of great educational and clinical value to the family physician and his or her patients.</ABSTRACT>

This study sought to quantify differences in interactions between mother-NOFTT infant pairs and control mother-thriving infant pairs. Eleven mother-NOFTT infant dyads and 11 control mother-infant dyads were videotaped for 30 minutes through a one-way mirror. Mother and infant behaviors were evaluated for 21 behavioral categories: 12 maternal, 7 infant, and 2 mutual. Statistically significant differences were noted in five (24 percent) categories. The quantity of maternal and infant vocalizations and the responsiveness of the mother to the infant's vocal cues were strikingly reduced in the NOFTT dyads.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians surveyed its members to determine their nursing home activities. The response rate was 66 percent. Eighty-three percent of members who responded had made at least one nursing home visit in the previous month. Nearly one half (48.1 percent) of physicians not currently caring for nursing home patients would continue to treat their own patient if that person were admitted to a nursing home. As the number of years in medical practice increased, statistically significant increases occurred in (1) the percentage of a practice composed of geriatric patients, (2) the number of visits made to nursing home patients, and (3) the number of hours and days spent in nursing homes. Physicians caring for nursing home patients (1) live in smaller communities, (2) spend more days each week in the office, (3) are not residency trained, (4) are board certified, and (5) have a greater percentage of patients in the geriatric age group. Physician nonparticipation in nursing homes was due to (1) too few nursing home patients in the practice, (2) inconvenience, and (3) excessive paperwork.</ABSTRACT>

Approximately 10 to 15 individuals die from snakebites each year, with bites from diamondback rattlesnakes accounting for 95 percent of fatalities. The identification of the two endogenous classes of venomous snakes are discussed in detail to aid in determining the proper treatment for each class. Approximately 25 percent of all pit viper bites are "dry" and result in no envenomation. The best first aid is a set of car keys to get the victim to a facility where antivenin is obtainable. Incision and suction should be limited to very special situations; cryotherapy and use of tourniquets applied by laymen should be avoided. Proper medical management at a health care facility requires establishing whether envenomation has occurred and to what extent, followed by appropriate dosing of antivenin. The use of corticosteroids and antibiotics is controversial. Tetanus immunization should be updated, if necessary. Although research in developing a more purified antivenin is under way, the best treatment for snakebite is prevention.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A follow-up of two panic disorder-agoraphobic study populations. The role of recruitment biases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A self-referred and recruited panic disorder-agoraphobic study population are compared in terms of their symptomatic presentation and treatment outcome. The recruited group was found to be more symptomatically severe, more phobic, less character disordered, and more likely to stay in treatment. Implications for the potential methodological biases in recruiting study populations are explored.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physiological responses of college students to a pet.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of a pet on cardiovascular responses of college students was examined under three test conditions (i.e., reading aloud, reading quietly, and interacting with an unknown dog). A repeated-measures analysis with three covariates was used to examine the effect of the treatment on each of six dependent variables (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and State and Trait Anxiety). Reading aloud differed from baseline measures under all treatment conditions (p less than .001) Reading quietly and interacting with a pet were slightly below baseline for all dependent variables with a slightly greater effect by reading quietly than interacting with a pet. Examination of interactions between variables revealed no significant differences. Effects on State anxiety level mirrored cardiovascular responses (p less than .001). Trait anxiety levels remained relatively constant throughout the treatments. Results indicated that interacting with a pet does affect physiological and psychological responses by lowering response levels. A parallel effect was also demonstrated by reading quietly. Given the effect of pet interaction upon selected indicators of health in well college students, these data suggest the relevance of examining this treatment with an "at-risk" group.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Impact of mental illness in families of mental health professionals.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Family burden and coping strategies were investigated in 84 experienced mental health professionals with family members suffering from chronic major mental illnesses. The sample was nationally recruited from ads in professional journals. Personal reactions of respondents involved cognitive and attitudinal changes in conceptions of psychotic disorders and guarded relations with colleagues with respect to self-disclosure and case involvement. Financial and emotional burdens were substantial, with ongoing stressful life events, aversive patient behaviors, and poor treatment histories. In rating family coping strategies, mental health professionals showed a high degree of concordance with nonprofessional family members in assigning priority to education on symptoms, medications, and patient management techniques. Involvement with self-help groups and physical separation from patients were rated higher than individual or family therapy as aids in coping for families of the mentally ill.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Suicide attempts in antisocial alcoholics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The dual diagnoses of alcoholism and antisocial personality are frequently associated with suicide attempts. A group of 94 alcoholics with antisocial personality were divided on the basis of a previous suicide attempt. A variety of symptoms, including depression, alcohol and drug abuse, conduct disorder, and violence were found more frequently in the suicide attempter group as reported on the structured interview. These emotional problems were additionally found to have an earlier onset. The results were consistent with the concept of secondary sociopathy and indicated that higher psychopathology may be associated with suicide behavior.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A patient is described with operationally diagnosed chronic schizophrenia who simultaneously experienced repeated "attacks" during which times he had intense apprehension and autonomic hyperactivity entirely similar to that usually described under the rubric of "panic attacks" in nonschizophrenic patients. Delusional and hallucinatory symptoms were also transiently exacerbated during these episodes. Alprazolam, as an adjunct to fluphenazine decanoate, was effective in ameliorating these symptoms. Diagnostic and treatment implications are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Investigating mental disorders in their natural settings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This issue of The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease reports fundamental research into the nature of mental disorders, using both new and traditional time-sampling approaches. The studies present convincing findings gathered in a variety of patient populations and demonstrate the utility of using quantitative and replicable methods in psychiatric research and clinical care. Research that adequately describes the person in context as well as the influence of situations on mental state has proved difficult. Methods such as the diary and Experience-Sampling Method that explore experiences in daily life overcome some of the shortcomings of previous psychiatric research strategies, such as reliance on retrospective recall and the failure to take the variability of mental state more fully into account. The studies in this issue introduce techniques for creating a data base for psychiatric research and clinical practice that is anchored in patient experience and behavior.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Infrequently occurring activities and contexts in time use data.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In this paper we describe an approach to the study of time use data that focuses on relatively infrequent activities as well as the contexts in which the activities take place. To illustrate the method, we present several examples from a secondary analysis of the Multinational Comparative Time-Budget data, based on over 25,000, 24-hour, time use diaries collected in 12 countries during 1965 through 1966. Activities that represent a small fraction of the overall time budget of a population may nevertheless yield valuable insights into a culture or group. Analyses of such mundane events as doing the laundry, transporting children, and taking a walk indicate marked differences among the countries surveyed in terms of frequencies, durations, by whom, and with whom these activities were typically performed. In the future, time use studies can be expected to contribute to the understanding of mental disorders in natural contexts. In contrasting specific diagnostic groups with normal subjects, analyses of specific activities (e.g., personal care, social interaction) or contexts (e.g., alone vs. with others, at home vs. away) may be particularly relevant. Strategies that combine continuous recording (diary) with repeated, instantaneous experience-sampling methods are likely to be the most useful in such studies of mental disorders.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Validity and reliability of the Experience-Sampling Method.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To understand the dynamics of mental health, it is essential to develop measures for the frequency and the patterning of mental processes in every-day-life situations. The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews practical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short- and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The daily life of ambulatory chronic mental patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this research is to describe in greater detail than is typically done the daily life experiences of 11 ambulatory chronic mental patients and 11 nonpsychiatric controls. The subjects, although diagnostically heterogeneous, were representative of Dutch chronic mental patients. The Experience-Sampling Method was used to signal subjects randomly 10 times a day for 6 consecutive days to fill out self-rating forms assessing mental state and contextual information at the moment of the signal. Compliance was good. In time-allocation comparisons with nonpsychiatric subjects the patients were found to live relatively "normal" lives. As expected, their psychopathology was influenced by social environments such as being alone, at home, or in society at large. Contrary to other studies that stress the social isolation of such individuals, the chronic subjects reported feeling better away from home and among people than normal subjects. When alone, chronic patients reported daydreaming more and noted a tendency to drift away from thoughts about current activities. Mental state fluctuations and daily interactions, characteristic of this group, are examined in relation to theories of vulnerability and coping style of chronic mental patients, with an eye to individualized treatment applications.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The monitoring of optimal experience. A tool for psychiatric rehabilitation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This article illustrates the use of quantitative time-sampling data in developing a psychology of "optimal experience" to help in the psychiatric development of adequate rehabilitation approaches. The Experience-Sampling Method was used on a sample of 47 Italian adolescent students to measure fluctuations in their experience. We found that the ratio of subjectively experienced challenges and skills was a fundamental parameter that predicted optimal experience as well as boredom and anxiety. In contrast, "low" experience in daily life was viewed as a risk factor that could be minimized to increase the quality of life. Monitoring fluctuations in optimal and low experience may therefore be an important tool in developing personalized psychiatric rehabilitation plans.</ABSTRACT>

- Experience sampling is a relatively new research approach that captures relevant variations in experience and symptoms in the course of everyday life. In this paper, a socioecological frame of reference that integrates psychological, historical, cultural, and developmental theories about anxiety phenomena will be illustrated using quantitative descriptions of anxiety and avoidance behaviors gathered with the Experience-Sampling Method. The interaction between anxiety symptoms and the environment in which they occurred is explored in a case study that points to possibilities for future research and the establishment of therapeutic approaches that are optimally suited to the individual patient.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Panic attacks in the natural environment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite much recent research, there is still little systematic information about the phenomenology of panic attacks, and their possible causes remain obscure. We investigated panic attacks in the natural environment using an event sampling approach. Twenty-seven panic attack patients and 19 matched normal controls kept panic attack and self-exposure diaries for 6 days and wore an ambulatory heart rate/physical activity recorder for 3 days. Patients reported 175 attacks, generally of moderate severity. The most frequent symptoms were palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, nausea, sweating, and chest pain/discomfort. The results did not support the classification of panic attacks recently proposed by Sheehan and Sheehan, which requires three symptoms as a cutoff for panic attacks. Panic attacks classified by the patients as situational (i.e., occurring in feared situations) were more severe and occurred in situational contexts different from spontaneous attacks, but were otherwise phenomenologically similar. Heart rates did not change during spontaneous attacks and were only mildly elevated during situational attacks or during the 15 minutes preceding these attacks. These heart rate changes were interpretable as effects of anxiety, although physical activity showed a similar pattern of changes. Some normal control subjects reported on the panic diary primarily situational anxiety episodes that were phenomenologically similar to, albeit less severe than, the patients' episodes. Panic patients may sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many attacks classified as spontaneous occurred in classical "phobic" situations. Furthermore, the comparison of concurrent diary and retrospective interview and questionnaire descriptions showed that panic patients have a tendency toward retrospective exaggeration. Implications for the assessment, definition, and classification of panic attacks are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Temporal and social contexts of heroin-using populations. An illustration of the snowball sampling technique.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Snowball sampling is a method that has been used in the social sciences to study sensitive topics, rare traits, personal networks, and social relationships. The method involves the selection of samples utilizing "insider" knowledge and referral chains among subjects who possess common traits that are of research interest. It is especially useful in generating samples for which clinical sampling frames may be difficult to obtain or are biased in some way. In this paper, snowball samples of heroin users in two Dutch cities have been analyzed for the purpose of providing descriptions and limited inferences about the temporal and social contexts of their lifestyles. Two distinct heroin-using populations have been discovered who are distinguished by their life cycle stage. Significant contextual explanations have been found involving the passage from adolescent peer group to criminal occupation, the functioning of network "knots" and "outcroppings," and the frequency of social contact. It is suggested that the snowball sampling method may have utility in studying the temporal and social contexts of other populations of clinical interest.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A variant of the time-sampling method, experience sampling, was used to produce a narrative description of the inner experience of a schizophrenic young woman. In general, her inner experience was predominantly visual, and those images were frequently "goofed up", i.e., tilted, obliterated, or inaccurate in detail. The case has methodological significance in that it demonstrates that the descriptive time-sampling method can provide useful information about individuals, and also has significance in our understanding of schizophrenia, in that it exemplifies in detail the everyday distortions of inner experience in schizophrenia.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- It has been increasingly recognised that patients with arachnoid cysts of the middle fossa appear more susceptible to the development of subdural haematomas. Seven patients with arachnoid cysts of the middle fossa and associated subdural haematomas are presented. Intra-cystic haemorrhage, masking the presence of an arachnoid cyst on computed tomography (CT) is highlighted. Repeat of CT scanning in young patients with subdural haematomas in the absence of severe trauma is recommended. Two theories are proposed to account for the observed susceptibility to the development of subdural haematomas in these patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Syringomyelia: cyst measurement by magnetic resonance imaging and comparison with symptoms, signs and disability.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The severity and distribution of symptoms and signs in patients with syringomyelia is considered to be dependent on the longitudinal and transverse dimensions of the syrinx and it is thought that clinical examination can identify the extent of the cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging has made the anatomical localisation of intramedullary spinal lesions more exact and probably more specific than previous methods of investigation. Syrinx length, diameters, cyst:cord and cord:canal ratios have been studied in 12 patients with syringomyelia to assess whether the dimensions of the syrinx relate to the clinical findings. The length of syrinx appeared to be related to cyst diameter, cyst:cord and cord:canal ratios. Patients with a small syrinx tended to have a small cyst diameter, and small cyst:cord and cord:canal ratios. No significant relationship was found between muscle wasting or weakness, distribution of sensory loss, degree of disability or distress and the dimensions of the syrinx. These findings should be borne in mind when surgical management is being considered.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Testing the vestibular-ocular reflexes: abnormalities of the otolith contribution in patients with neuro-otological disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Conventional vestibular rotation testing with the head centered on the axis stimulates the semicircular canals evoking compensatory eye movements. If the head is placed forwards of the axis in an eccentric position the otoliths are also stimulated by a tangential linear acceleration acting laterally to the skull. In normal subjects the additional otolithic stimulus evokes compensatory eye movements with a higher gain than with head centred, particularly for high frequency (greater than 0.1 Hz) stimuli. The responses with head centred and eccentric in various patients with known/suspected neuro-otological abnormalities have been compared. Patients with vestibular neurinectomies who have asymmetrical head centred responses showed greater asymmetry with head eccentric at higher stimulus frequencies. Some patients with cerebellar lesions showed abnormally enhanced or depressed and asymmetrical responses with head eccentric in comparison with head centred responses, which could be normal. The enhancing effects could be specific to low frequency stimuli. All patients who showed abnormal responses with head eccentric also had positional nystagmus provoked by the gravity acceleration vector when the head was tilted laterally. The direction of the positional nystagmus with respect to the gravity vector was not necessarily the same as the direction of the effect on eye movements of lateral acceleration during eccentric oscillation. Patients with benign paroxysmal vertigo or chronic linear vertigo in whom otolithic abnormalities are suspected were not found to have abnormal responses with head eccentric. We conclude that this method of testing may be useful in elucidating pathophysiology but is not a decisive clinical test for the presence of disordered otolith function.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Muscle fibre type composition, motoneuron firing properties, axonal conduction velocity and refractory period for foot extensor motor units in dystrophia myotonica.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seven patients with dystrophia myotonica were investigated using neurophysiological combined with histochemical techniques to elucidate motor unit properties in foot extensor muscles, which are often involved in the early stages of this disorder. For the 25 extensor digitorum brevis motor units studied the axonal conduction velocity, the axonal refractory period and the voluntary firing properties were within normal limits. However, high threshold motor units were not observed and the mean value of the axonal conduction velocities was lower (p less than 0.02) for the dystrophia myotonica motor units when compared with corresponding data from healthy subjects. There were also signs of impaired impulse propagation in the terminal part of the motor unit. In muscle biopsy specimens from the anterior tibial muscle, fibre type composition and structure were demonstrated using enzyme histochemical techniques for adenosine-triphosphate and immunohistochemical techniques for identification of the types of myosin isoform present. The histochemical findings indicated a type I fibre dominance, which was most obvious in the more seriously affected muscles. Neonatal myosin was observed preferentially in small but also in some normal sized fibres. Furthermore, some ring fibres were present and these showed staining with antineonatal myosin in their superficial portion. This indicates that an abnormal regeneration is one cause of the myopathic appearance of the muscle fibres in dystrophia myotonica. These investigations show that there is a reduced proportion of type II motor units in foot extensor muscles involved in the myopathy in dystrophia myotonica although it cannot definitely be established whether this is due to a loss of high threshold type II motor units or type II to type I transformation.</ABSTRACT>

- In 30 comatose head injured patients vestibulo-ocular responses were elicited by caloric stimulation. Inter- and intra-observer agreement of these responses was studied. The responses were shown in the form of a film to ten doctors who classified them into four categories: no reaction, tonic reaction, paradoxical nystagmus and nystagmus. The level of the coefficient Kappa (a chance-corrected measure of interobserver agreement) was 0.50; this is within the range of levels for most components of clinical examination reported in the literature.</ABSTRACT>

Intravenous pressors were successful in treating acute episodes but neither drug therapy nor surgical neck exploration reliably prevented syncopal attacks. Glossopharyngeal and/or vagal nerve infiltration by tumour with episodic activation of the afferent limb of the baroreflex arc producing vasodilatation primarily due to sympathetic withdrawal is the likely mechanism of life threatening syncope in this patient.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Contraindications to lumbar puncture as defined by computed cranial tomography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Papilloedema is not always an adequate predictor of potential complications from lumbar puncture, and many clinicians are using computed tomography (CT) before lumbar puncture in an effort to identify more accurately the "at risk" patient. This paper identifies the following anatomical criteria defined by CT scanning that correlate with unequal pressures between intracranial compartments and predispose a patient to herniation following decompression of the spinal compartment: lateral shift of midline structures, loss of the suprachiasmatic and basilar cisterns, obliteration of the fourth ventricle, or obliteration of the superior cerebellar and quadrigeminal plate cisterns with sparing of the ambient cisterns. These criteria should be considered to be contraindications to lumbar puncture.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intracerebral haemorrhage: a model for the prediction of outcome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The hospital charts and CT scans of 112 patients with spontaneous supratentorial haemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate factors important to prognosis. A low Glasgow Coma Scale score, coma, ataxic respiration, abnormal pupils, acute hypertension, large haemorrhage size and intraventricular extension of blood were associated with a poor outcome. Multivariate analysis using the technique of logistic regression identified three variables, the Glasgow Coma Scale score, haemorrhage size and intraventricular extension of blood, which were most predictive of outcome. A model was developed from this analysis which accurately estimates the probability of good outcome and the risk of poor outcome based on data available on presentation. With additional validation, this model may be useful in choosing patients for surgical evacuation of haematomas.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Distribution of type VI collagen in human gliomas: comparison with fibronectin and glioma-mesenchymal matrix glycoprotein.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The distribution of type VI collagen was examined immunohistochemically in normal tissues and in 24 human gliomas and six medulloblastomas. Its localization in the neoplasms was compared with that of fibronectin and glioma-mesenchymal extracellular matrix (GMEM) glycoprotein. In normal non-neural tissues type VI collagen was demonstrated in the interstitial connective tissue and in some basement membranes. In normal brain it was localized to the vasculature, leptomeninges, and pial-glial membrane. In neoplasms type VI collagen and fibronectin codistributed in the vasculature and stromal connective tissue. The GMEM glycoprotein, as identified by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 81C6, and a related glioma-mesenchymal matrix antigen identified by MAb 2A6, were expressed not only in the tumor vasculature and connective tissue, but also within the tumor parenchyma in association with glioma cells. The staining intensity was variable in 20 malignant gliomas and weak to absent in two pilocytic astrocytomas and six medulloblastomas. An oligodendroglioma and ependymoma both expressed the 2A6 epitope, but staining with MAb 81C6 was weak to absent. The antigens identified by MAb 81C6 and MAb 2A6 represent the only recognized extracellular matrix components, other than proteoglycans, that are associated with glioma cells in vivo. As prominent constituents of the pericellular matrix, they may be involved in recognized matrix functions such as the modulation of cell adhesion and migration.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Apolipoprotein E is released by rat sciatic nerve during segmental demyelination and remyelination.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Apolipoprotein E (apo E) is synthesized and released in greatly increased amounts by peripheral nerve following Wallerian degeneration; it has been suggested that this protein may function in the transport of degenerated myelin lipid. The purpose of this study was to determine if the amount of apo E released by rat peripheral nerve is increased following selective demyelination, in the absence of significant axonopathy. Using an immunoturbidimetric assay, release of apo E from excised sciatic nerve segments was measured during the phases of acute demyelination and remyelination caused by tellurium (Te) toxicity, during segmental demyelination in chronic lead (Pb) poisoning, and during Wallerian degeneration following nerve crush. Morphologic changes were examined in contralateral sciatic nerves by nerve-fiber teasing or by light and electron microscopy of transverse sections. As in previous studies, the amount of apo E released from the nerves was greatly increased following Wallerian degeneration due to nerve crush. In Te neuropathy, increased release of apo E was first detected on the fourth day of Te exposure, corresponding temporally to the acute onset of paralysis and segmental demyelination. Apolipoprotein E release rose steeply to a maximum of ten times the control values by day 9 and then gradually waned during the next five weeks, corresponding to a period of active remyelination and resolution of the neuropathy. In the demyelinating neuropathy of chronic lead poisoning, apo E release was increased four times over control animals after seven weeks of exposure, with less than 10% of teased fibers showing early paranodal demyelination and no evidence of remyelination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Multiple neural cell types are infected in vitro by border disease virus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Border disease (BD) of sheep results from a congenitally acquired nonarbotogavirus infection which causes a highly selective central nervous system (CNS) pathological lesion consisting of diffuse decreased myelination without inflammation or neuronal destruction. Thus, a selective disruption of oligodendroglial function appears to occur. In order to investigate the in vitro cell tropism of BD virus, primary cultures derived from fetal and adult ovine CNS and peripheral nervous system were inoculated with BD virus. Infected cell types were determined by dual immunofluorescent labeling for viral and cell type specific antigens. Infection of all the major cell types represented in these cultures, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, fibroblasts, dorsal root ganglion neurons and Schwann cells was found. Oligodendrocytes were only infected earlier and appeared to remain infected longer than astrocytes and fibroblasts. Infectious virus was produced by all cultures and continued to be produced even after the disappearance of nearly all immunocytochemically detectable viral antigen within cells. These studies suggest that the selective dysfunction of the oligodendrocyte in BD is not based on a selective viral tropism.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Morphological responses to local CNS trauma: sprouting and synaptogenesis within membranes implanted into mature cerebral cortex of the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to document in vivo neuronal sprouting in response to local trauma of the mature cerebral neocortex. The experimental approach enabled direct and unequivocal ultrastructural identification of newly sprouted neuronal processes and their synaptic relationships. Morphologically detectable factors that influence neuronal sprouting were also assessed. Tiny fragments of porous, synthetic membrane were implanted into the mature neocortex of the rat. After one week, axons, dendrites, growth cone-like structures, synapses, and processes from astrocytes and microglia were present deep within the interstices of the implant. Morphometric analysis of synapses within the implant, support the qualitative impression of active neuronal ingrowth and de novo synaptogenesis by these sprouted elements. Astrocytic processes appear to comprise the major barrier to neuronal invasion of the implant. Several observations suggested that glia sometimes may facilitate neuronal ingrowth. These findings provide direct morphological documentation of axonal and dendritic plasticity in the mature rat neocortex. The work demonstrates a strategy that could be useful for further evaluating the cellular mechanism of in vivo neuronal regeneration.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of new vessels and macrophages in the development and resolution of edema following a cortical freeze lesion in the mouse.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The role of an influx of macrophages and neovascularity in the resolution of vasogenic edema is not well defined. The inhibition of these processes with x-irradiation or parenteral corticosteroid administration was used to evaluate their contribution to the resolution of edema around a cortical freeze lesion in mice. The resorption of Evans blue, a marker of protein extravasation, was delayed in x-irradiated mice on the second day following a freeze lesion (p = 0.0075), which correlates with a delay in macrophage infiltration around the lesion. The specific gravity of the lesion and its border regions was significantly less in x-irradiated animals on day 7 than in controls (p = 0.00062), which correlates with a delay in new vessel formation around the lesion. Administration of corticosteroids from the time of production of the freeze lesion resulted in a specific gravity significantly less than control when measured eight days after the lesion (p = 0.01). Macrophages may participate by inhibiting the development of the macromolecular portion of vasogenic edema. The development of neovascularity correlates with the resorption of the aqueous portion of vasogenic edema. As with x-irradiation, corticosteroids administered from the time of freeze lesion inhibited the resorption of the aqueous portion of vasogenic edema, but they may suppress the spread of edema in this experimental model.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in number and size of Clarke's column neurons after cord transection.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The number of large neurons in Clarke's column of the L-1 segment of the spinal cord of the rat decreases five or more weeks after a T-9 spinal cord transection. Analysis of cells at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 weeks (wk) postoperatively demonstrates a loss of large neurons at each time interval beyond five wk postoperatively. Comparison of cell sizes found in the anatomic region of Clarke's column at two or three wk postoperatively with the cells found at 15 wk after transection and their respective control groups, shows a decrease in total cells found in operated rats 15 wk postoperative with a profound decrease in larger neurons in these rats. We did not detect a significant offsetting increase in smaller neurons. We believe the observed changes are due to death of large neurons and can find no evidence to support the contention that axotomized cells persist in a shrunken, atrophic state.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the aged.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was found in 57% of 123 autopsy brains removed from patients aged 59-101 years. The incidence of CAA increased with age. CAA was seen most frequently in the occipital cortex. Immunohistochemically, amyloid of CAA was positive for amyloid P component and negative for human AA protein and human prealbumin. The presence and severity of CAA were significantly correlated with the number of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The incidence of CAA in 17 patients with dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) was estimated to be 88% and was significantly higher than that in 26 patients with dementia of non-Alzheimer type. CAA had a pathogenetic relationship with both brain ageing and DAT. Lobar cerebral haemorrhage was found in 3 patients with CAA of marked or moderate degree. Lobar cerebral haemorrhage in the aged and in patients with DAT suggest the presence of CAA.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency: absence of correlation with exercise intolerance in 452 muscle biopsies.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A histochemical assay was routinely performed of myoadenylate deaminase (MAD) in muscle biopsy specimens. MAD was absent in 13 cases, i.e. 2.9% of the specimens. In 10 cases the deficiency was confirmed biochemically. The diagnoses in the 13 patients were: polyneuropathy (n = 5), infantile spinal muscular atrophy (n = 3), congenital myopathy with type 2 fibre atrophy, facioscapulohumeral myopathy, polymyositis, myotonic dystrophy and hyperornithinaemia with gyrate atrophy of the retina. In contrast, 35 unrelated patients presenting with exercise-related muscle cramps or pains showed normal histochemical MAD activity. The biopsy specimens in all of these patients were essentially normal and in none of them was the diagnosis of a neuromuscular disease made. The results failed to confirm the association of MAD deficiency with aches, cramps and pains or exertional myalgia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evaluation by MRI of paraparesis and tetraparesis of undiagnosed aetiology.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical, neuroradiological, electrophysiological and CSF findings of seven patients with slowly progressive paraparesis or tetraparesis are presented. In all patients, the results of the tests performed, including evoked potentials, CT scanning, oligoclonal bands in the CSF and myelography, were normal or inconclusive and did not lead to the correct diagnosis of the aetiology. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided the diagnosis of the causative process: multiple sclerosis in four cases, meningioma of the craniocervical junction or upper thoracic spinal cord in two cases, and upper cervical cord low-grade astrocytoma in one case. The patients with tumour could be treated effectively. Without MRI, however, the correct diagnosis would have been delayed. T2-weighted spin-echo scans provided maximal sensitivity for the detection of MS plaques, although they lacked specificity for a special disease. Several morphological criteria during MRI were helpful in differentiating Binswanger's disease, leucodystrophy and adrenoleucodystrophy from MS. It is concluded that at present MRI is the only non-invasive test with which to screen reliably the craniocervical junction and the upper cervical level, both of which are diagnostically difficult regions. The case histories also demonstrate that MRI is essential in all patients where a full clinical evaluation of the suspected spinal segment is not possible. "Pure spinal MS" is a misleading diagnosis and should not be accepted without confirmation by MRI. MRI has to be performed early enough to permit timely treatment of spinal and brain-stem disorders.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A 34-year-old man developed slowly progressive muscular wasting of facioscapulohumeral (FSH) distribution with marked asymmetry. Clinical features, family history and laboratory findings were consistent with the diagnosis of FSH dystrophy. However, muscle biopsy revealed an inflammatory reaction with perivascular and endomysial infiltrate, myophagocytosis and invasion of the fibres by mononuclear cells. Monoclonal antibody analysis of the phenotypes of cells in the biopsy specimen suggested that cell-mediated immune response may occur during muscle fibre injury in FSH dystrophy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The subcortical generated somatosensory evoked potentials in non-cephalic, cephalic, and anterior neck referenced recordings in a patient with a cervico-medullary lesion: a clue to the identification of the P14/N14 and N13 generators.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were studied in a patient before and after the development of a cervico-medullary lesion. The first examination demonstrated normal subcortical generated potentials N13 and N14. The second examination, following a subarachnoid haemorrhage at the cervico-medullary junction, displayed a delayed and reduced amplitude P14/N14 peak on both sides. P14/N14 showed the same latency in all montages, using non-cephalic, cephalic and anterior neck references. The N13 component was not significantly changed in latency compared with the first examination. The latencies of the N13 peak were variable in the different montages. They increased from the lower (C7) to the upper (C2) neck, whereas the latency of the N13 onset was identical in all montages. This alteration might be caused by a delayed near-field activity at C2 overlapping the N13 component. These results fit the hypothesis of two major generators responsible for subcortical SEPs; a near-field N13 component at the level of the lower neck and a far-field P14 component arising from the level of the cervico-medullary junction. An additional minor near-field activity generated by the cuneate nucleus is suspected.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Degenerescence systematisee optico-cochleo-dentelee.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During the first year of life a girl, the first child of non-consanguineous parents, developed a progressive neurological disease characterized by blindness, severe hypotonia, impaired motor development, microcephaly and mental retardation. Later she became unresponsive to auditory stimuli. She died at the age of 13 months. Post-mortem examination revealed atrophy of the optic nerves and chiasm, lateral geniculate nuclei and superior colliculi, degeneration of the cochlear nerve roots, dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei, superior olives, lateral lemnisci, medial geniculate nuclei and inferior colliculi and atrophy of the dentate nuclei, hilus and superior cerebellar peduncles. These were consistent with degenerescence systematisee optico-cochleeo-dentelee. Additional abnormalities included degeneration of the posterior columns in the spinal cord, gracilis and cuneate nuclei and medial lemnisci, atrophy of the spinocerebellar tracts and Clarke's columns, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, chiefly involving the rostral vermis, inferior olivary nuclei and demyelination of the sural nerves.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A case of "myopathy with tubular aggregates" with increased muscle fibre sensitivity to caffeine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 23-year-old man with "myopathy with tubular aggregates" had suffered from exercise-induced muscle cramps for 1 year. His general and neurological findings were normal. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits except for a slightly elevated serum creatine kinase level. Muscle biopsy showed some small angular fibres and scattered type 2B fibres with prominent tubular aggregates originating from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since the muscle fibres contracted at a lower concentration of caffeine, increased muscle fibre sensitivity to caffeine is probably related to muscle cramps in this disorder. Tubular aggregates are then secondarily formed in the muscle fibres.</ABSTRACT>

- Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain biopsy in a 44-year-old woman, for whom therapeutic trials with various antiviral agents were made. Despite early diagnosis and treatment, her neurological deterioration and extension of MRI-detectable lesions were not halted for a period of about 8 months. After the introduction of intrathecal beta-interferon therapy, her neurological status and MRI findings became stable and showed minimal improvement. Early diagnosis of this fatal disorder is important and intrathecal interferon therapy should be considered.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Becker and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy associated with pituitary dwarfism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 1981 a report appeared of a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy associated with dwarfism caused by growth hormone deficiency, in whom the muscular disease was unusually benign. The authors suggested that the benign course might be related to the growth hormone deficiency and dwarfism. Other authors later supported this idea, having observed that in dystrophic mice and hamsters with congenital and experimentally induced pituitary dwarfism, respectively, pathological expressions of the dystrophy were markedly reduced. In this paper one case of Becker and one of limb-girdle dystrophy, each associated with short stature and growth hormone deficiency are described. In these cases the disease did not have a particularly benign course. It is concluded that caution is necessary, at least in certain cases, before an association between reduced muscular growth and the dystrophic process can be assumed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Neuromuscular, autonomic and central cholinergic hyperactivity associated with thymoma and acetylcholine receptor-binding antibody.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two cases of a neuromuscular hyperactivity syndrome associated with a proliferative thymoma and high serum titres of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody with no signs of myasthenia are reported. The clinical and electrodiagnostic findings indicated generalized cholinergic hyperactivity at the neuromuscular junction and in the autonomic and central nervous system, resulting in generalized myokymia, excessive sweating and intermittent psychotic behaviour. The association with thymoma and raised AChR antibody suggests that this syndrome represents a unique type of autoimmune disease, in which antibodies against the AChR facilitate rather than inhibit cholinergic action. This conclusion is supported by the remission of symptoms after thymectomy and with immunosuppressive therapy in one case.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Three unrelated school teachers taught in the same school classroom for 2-5 years and subsequently developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) over an 18-year period. This clustering was not accompanied by an increased death rate for ALS in the county where the teachers lived and worked. Statistical analysis revealed that ALS as the cause of death for three teachers from the same school would be highly improbable as a random event. These findings suggest that the patient's shared school environment may have been a source of exposure to an agent pathogenetically significant in the development of their disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chemotherapy versus chemoimmunotherapy (CAF v CAFVP v CMF each +/- MER) for metastatic carcinoma of the breast: a CALGB study. Cancer and Leukemia Group B.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three combination chemotherapy regimens each with or without the methanol-extracted residue of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (MER) were compared for efficacy. After stratification for disease-free interval and dominant sites of disease, patients were randomized to either CMF (cyclophosphamide [CYC], 100 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14; methotrexate [MTX], 40 mg intravenously [IV], days 1 and 8; 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], 500 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), or CAF (CYC, 100 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14; doxorubicin [DOX], 25 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8; 5-FU, 500 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), or CAFVP (CAF as above plus vincristine [VCR], 1.0 mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8; and prednisone [PRED], 40 mg/m2 orally, days 1 through 14). Nonspecific immunotherapy with MER was administered in five sites at 100 micrograms or at the lowest tenfold dilution that produced a 1-cm indurated lesion. A total of 432 patients were entered, but 37 were disqualified, leaving 395 evaluable for treatment results and toxicities. One hundred thirty-five evaluable patients were randomized to chemoimmunotherapy until October 28, 1978. One hundred twenty-six evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy alone in the same time period. For the entire study, a total of 260 evaluable patients were randomized to chemotherapy. Chemoimmunotherapy patients were compared with the initial 126 chemotherapy patients. Chemotherapy regimens were compared among all 260 patients. Patient characteristics were similar between regimens and between chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy treatment groups. For patients on chemotherapy plus MER, there was no significant differences between the regimens for response frequencies: 43%, 41%, and 32%, respectively for CMF, CAF, and CAFVP. The comparable chemotherapy alone group had 36%, 58%, and 63% response, respectively. The response rates, adjusted for chemotherapy regimen, were 52% and 38% (P = .02) for chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. MER was associated with painful ulcers and fevers. Thus, MER produced toxicity without response or survival benefit and further randomization after October 28, 1978 was to chemotherapy alone. For 260 evaluable patients on chemotherapy alone, the complete (CR) and partial responses (PR) were 37%, 55%, and 58%, respectively for CMF, CAF, and CAFVP. These response rates for CAF and CAFVP were significantly better than CMF (P = .01 and P less than .01, respectively). These comparisons were consistent within subgroupings such as dominant sites of disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chemohormonal therapy in advanced carcinoma of the breast: Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol 8081.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In a prospective, randomized trial Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) evaluated CAF chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) v CAF plus tamoxifen (TCAF) in advanced breast cancer. Patients were stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status, dominant site of metastatic disease, menopausal status, and prior adjuvant therapy. Regardless of ER status or menopausal status, the addition of tamoxifen conferred no significant advantage in response rate, response duration, time to treatment failure (TTF) or survival over CAF alone. A secondary objective was to compare the response to CAF of ER positive (ER+) and ER negative (ER-) patients to determine if there was a differential response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Response rates of ER+ and ER- patients to CAF were identical (56%), but the response duration, time to treatment failure, and survival of ER+ patients were significantly longer than ER- patients. This lack of differential response implies that chemotherapy and hormonal therapy may compete for the same pool of ER+ cells. It also suggests that chemotherapy kills breast cancer cells indiscriminately, regardless of ER status.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Two-hundred seventy-three node-positive primary breast cancer patients with positive estrogen or progesterone receptors were placed on a short-term chemohormonal adjuvant program that included tamoxifen. At present, 64 have relapsed, 19 of whom have been rechallenged with tamoxifen after disease-free intervals (DFI) ranging from 0.4 to 4.4 years. Most patients had only one site of disease recurrence. Two patients have achieved complete remission (CR) and three partial remission (PR) for a CR and PR rate of 26% (95% confidence interval for CR and PR is 9% to 51%). Duration of response has ranged from 3 to 17+ months. Patients who receive short-term adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen and who relapse may respond to tamoxifen rechallenge. In this series, the response rate to tamoxifen rechallenge was similar to the response rate for patients unselected for estrogen receptor status receiving first-line endocrine therapy for breast cancer relapse.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgery after initial chemotherapy for localized small-cell carcinoma of the lung.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite the high response rates induced by chemotherapy, many patients with limited small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) relapse at the site of primary disease. Failure of radiotherapy to overcome this has led to the use of surgery as part of a combined modality approach. Between December 1981 and December 1985, 189 patients with SCLC were assessed for suitability for surgery after an initial three cycles of chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide). Fifty-seven were found to have limited disease, and of these, 19 were ineligible or unfit for surgery. Of the 38 eligible patients, 84% had an objective response to three cycles of chemotherapy and 25 were deemed suitable for surgery after restaging. At thoracotomy, four were inoperable, nine had a lobectomy, and 12 had a pneumonectomy. There was no evidence of viable SCLC in four resection specimens (one stage 1, two stage 2, one stage 3 at presentation), no viable SCLC but an entirely separate focus of viable poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma (SqLC) in one, and the remaining specimens contained viable SCLC. Survival of patients selected to undergo tumor resection was excellent (median survival, 33 months; plateau phase, 48% alive at 3 to 5 years), but survival of the entire group with limited SCLC was not dissimilar from that reported in previous series of limited-stage tumor treated with chemotherapy alone. Long-term survival appeared to be largely restricted to those with no evidence of viable SCLC at surgery (no viable SCLC, zero of five relapsed; viable SCLC, 13 of 16 relapsed and/or died). This prospective study confirms the feasibility of the combined modality approach, but suggests that any improvement in overall survival is likely to be small. Until the results from multicenter randomized trials are available, surgery, as part of a combined modality program, should be regarded as experimental.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intra-arterial cisplatin and FUDR in advanced malignancies confined to the head and neck.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-seven patients with advanced malignancies confined to the head and neck region were treated with intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) using implantable pumps or injection ports. Tumor histologies were: 16 squamous cell, one mucoepidermoid, one adenocarcinoma, one neuroendocrine, four adenoid cystic, two acinic cell, one fibrosarcoma, and one melanoma. All primaries originated from tissues in the head and neck area. Nineteen patients had received prior treatment, including chemotherapy in 13; eight were newly diagnosed. Responses in 26 evaluable patients were two complete (CR), ten partial (PR), six minor (MR), and eight progressions. The median duration of response was 5 months, with a range of 2 to 11 months. Sites of progression were within the infused volume in 13 patients and to uninfused local-regional or distant sites in eight. The response rate in the subset of 15 patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer was 47%. Toxicity in the 26 patients included stomatitis in 88%, nausea and vomiting in 64%, myelosuppression in 15%, and grade 1 nephrotoxicity in 1%. A regional advantage for IA cisplatin and FUDR can be calculated based on total body clearance rates (CLTB) for these agents and estimates of external carotid artery (ECA) blood flow. However, frequent progression of disease outside the infused volume to regional and distant sites limits the usefulness of this approach in recurrent disease patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long-term survival of advanced refractory ovarian carcinoma patients with small-volume disease treated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ninety ovarian carcinoma patients failing primary intravenous (IV) combination chemotherapy were treated with cisplatin-based combination intraperitoneal therapy. Sixty-five patients had residual disease greater than 2 cm at the start of intraperitoneal therapy. Their median survival was 8 months. Twenty-five patients had disease less than 2 cm; their median survival was greater than 49 months, and the survival curve has an apparent plateau at 69%, with no relapses having occurred after 32 months. The median survival for all 90 patients was 15 months. The median duration of follow-up for all patients was 37 months. These results confirm the critical role of tumor bulk in determining the effectiveness of intraperitoneal therapy, and suggest a role for intraperitoneal salvage treatment in patients with small-volume disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pharmacokinetics and toxicity of intraperitoneal cisplatin combined with regional hyperthermia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hyperthermia (HT) potentiates in vitro cytotoxicity of cisplatin, providing a rationale for HT enhancement of cisplatin effect in vivo. In this study, regional abdominal HT was combined with intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin in canines to characterize temperature distributions, as well as pharmacokinetics and toxicity of IP cisplatin with and without HT. Cisplatin (65 mg/m2) in normal saline was administered IP with a two-hour dwell time in ten Beagle dogs. Five of the ten dogs were randomly selected to receive concurrent regional microwave-producing HT at approximately 41.5 degrees C (IP) for a 60-minute period. Systemic temperatures in heated animals ranged from 37 degrees C to 40 degrees C; IP temperatures ranged from 39 degrees C to 44 degrees C. Initial IP temperatures ranged from 39 degrees C to 44 degrees C. Initial IP cisplatin concentrations were ten to 22 times greater than serum levels; the IP drug half-lives were 133 +/- 9 minutes and 68 +/- 15 minutes in heated and unheated dogs, respectively (P less than .001). Total concentrations of serum and urine cisplatin did not differ between the heated and unheated controls. The area under the concentration v time curve for free, ultrafilterable cisplatin in serum in units of percent minutes was 40 +/- 8 in heated and 60 +/- 7 in unheated controls (P = .006). Except for transient nausea and vomiting, no evidence of serious toxicity was observed in serum chemistries or histopathologic sections at 21 days post-treatment. Experiments involving in vitro incubation of cisplatin in normal saline were performed as a function of saline temperature; these showed that the amount of reactive cisplatin metabolites formed increased linearly with temperature by approximately 30% from 38 degrees C to 44 degrees C. This study supports the hypothesis that, with IP temperature elevation, there is an increased rate of generation and retention of reactive metabolites of cisplatin in the peritoneal cavity relative to unheated controls. In spite of these differences in pharmacokinetics, no significant toxicity was encountered. This study provides a model for treatment of IP malignancy such as ovarian carcinoma with IP cisplatin and regional HT.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Combination chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the cervix.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-four patients with recurrent or widespread adenocarcinoma of the cervix were treated with combination chemotherapy. The drugs used were 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (500 to 800 mg/m2), doxorubicin (40 to 50 mg/m2), and cisplatin (50 to 60 mg/m2). The chemotherapy was administered as a 76-hour continuous infusion via a silastic central venous catheter and repeated every 28 days. The total response rate was 42% (25% complete and 17% partial). Median duration of response was 7 months. Areas of response were usually lung and lymph node metastases. Toxicity, mainly neutropenia, was acceptable. All patients relapsed. This combination chemotherapy results in a modest response rate for a malignancy about which there is little information regarding the treatment of disseminated disease. Future studies should determine the activity of this combination administered in a bolus fashion.</ABSTRACT>

- A total of 340 patients with Hodgkin's disease were evaluated for the occurrence of intercurrent fatalities after treatment with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, combined modality therapy, and salvage chemotherapy. Mean follow-up time was 76.6 months. Causes of death were compared with the expected risk, calculated from mortality statistics of the Netherlands' population. Sixty-seven patients died of progressive Hodgkin's disease, whereas 37 patients died of causes unrelated to advanced disease. Patients showed an increased risk of dying of leukemia and solid tumors (P less than .001), whereas the risk of dying of cardiovascular complications was not increased. The 10-year actuarial risk of dying of leukemia varied between 0% for patients treated with radiotherapy only and 5.7% for those needing salvage chemotherapy. The 10-year risk of dying of solid tumors was 0% for patients treated with chemotherapy and 6.5% for those receiving radiotherapy. Treatment-related fatalities were highest after combined modality therapy (P less than .025); the corresponding 10-year risk was 6.1%. Compared with younger ones, patients greater than or equal to 40 years had an increased risk of dying of causes unrelated to progressive Hodgkin's diseases. The actuarial risk of developing intercurrent fatalities at 10 years was 4.9% in patients less than 40 years, and 34.7% in those greater than or equal to 40 years (P less than .001). Compared with population based statistics, patients successfully treated for Hodgkin's disease still showed an increased risk of dying (P less than .001). Treatment modality, stage, and histologic subtype were not predictors of intercurrent death.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Modification of Kiel and working formulation classifications for improved survival prediction in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The total survival of 203 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was analyzed according to the working formulation (WF) and "expanded" Kiel classifications. The original Kiel classification consisting of low grade (LG) and high grade (HG) forms corresponded well to the LG and HG forms of the WF. When an expanded Kiel containing an intermediate grade (IG) composed of the original LG diffuse group was devised, this gave a much better separation of survival of the three grades as compared with the WF where the survival of IG and HG forms were nonsignificantly different. The main reason for this difference was the inclusion of the so-called centroblastic diffuse form in the HG Kiel, but in the IG according to the WF. In a "modified" WF analysis where this histologic entity was placed in the HG subgroup, the three survival curves then gave excellent separation like the expanded Kiel classification. Since the centroblastic diffuse form (and its analogous forms according to other classifications) has a poor prognosis, it is important that it be so recognized and treated accordingly with aggressive therapy. We propose either our expanded Kiel or modified WF classification of the three grade forms as an excellent predictor of survival.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effects of distance from primary treatment centers on survival among patients with multiple myeloma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-one comprehensive cancer centers participated in a national reporting system of common data items, recording information on all patients seen between 1977 and 1982. There were 240,531 patients who had data abstracted. This report describes 1,479 patients with multiple myeloma. Parameters that may effect the type of treatment given during the initial episode of therapy in the center and the effect of these characteristics on survival were studied. In the univariate analysis, age, treatment, and distance traveled to the center were statistically associated with survival. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for potentially confounding covariates, blacks survive better than whites and the effects of sex and socioeconomic status (SES) on survival approach significance. Survival consistently improved with increasing distance traveled to treatment centers. This may be a serious confounding variable in assessing the results by both single and multiinstitution clinical trials.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of spinal magnetic resonance imaging and myelography in cancer patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Spinal involvement by systemic malignancy is common, and often leads to extradural compression of the spinal cord and/or nerve roots by metastases. Rapid, anatomically accurate diagnosis is essential to the successful management of these patients. We compared spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional myelography in a series of 31 cancer patients being evaluated for myelopathy (N = 10), or back/radicular pain (N = 21). All patients were evaluated between April 1985 and July 1986, and underwent both studies within ten days of each other (median, two days). MRI was performed on a 0.5 Tesla Technicare unit with a body surface coil, and results compared with standard contrast myelography. All studies were reviewed separately and in a "blinded" fashion. MRI and myelography were comparable in detecting large lesions that produced complete subarachnoid block (five of ten patients with myelopathy, three of twenty-one patients with back/radicular pain). In 19 of 31 patients, smaller but clinically significant extradural lesions were found. In nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated equally well by both modalities; in nine of 19 cases, these lesions were demonstrated by myelography alone; in one of 19, a lesion was demonstrated by MRI alone. Given our current technology, myelography appeared superior to MRI as a single imaging modality. However, MRI may be an alternative in patients where total myelography is technically impossible or unusually hazardous.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Subtemporal-preauricular infratemporal fossa approach to large lateral and posterior cranial base neoplasms.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A subtemporal-preauricular infratemporal fossa approach to remove 22 large neoplasms involving the lateral and posterior cranial base is detailed. The areas from which a neoplasm could be removed by this approach included the sphenoid and clival bone; the medial half of the petrous temporal bone; the infratemporal fossa; the nasopharynx; the retro- and parapharyngeal area; the ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses; and the intradural clivus-foramen magnum area. The pathology of the neoplasms included benign tumors such as meningioma, malignant cartilaginous neoplasms such as chordoma, and other malignant lesions such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This approach offers many advantages over other anterior and lateral approaches to the lateral and posterior cranial base: these include minimal brain retraction; direct access to the ipsilateral petrous and upper cervical internal carotid artery; reconstruction of extensive cranial base defects, often with the use of a vascularized rectus abdominus flap; preservation of the hearing conduction mechanism when it is not involved by tumor; and the maintenance of excellent facial nerve function postoperatively. The use of an anterior extradural approach (transethmoidal) and of an intradural approach (frontotemporal or retromastoid), either concurrently or separately, is necessary in some patients to effect total tumor removal. The most serious complication in this series was the death of a patient due to postoperative infection and bilateral carotid artery rupture, which may have been avoided by the use of a rectus abdominis muscle flap for reconstruction. Among the 21 surviving patients, 18 had a good outcome, two had a fair outcome, and one with preexisting neurological deficits had a poor outcome. One of the surviving patients with a chordoma died of pulmonary metastases 1 year later, without evidence of local recurrence. The length of postoperative follow-up evaluation in these patients is insufficient to make any judgment about the effectiveness of this surgical approach in achieving a cure or long-term control of the tumors described.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adjuvant high-dose photoradiation therapy in the treatment of cerebral glioma: a phase 1-2 study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A Phase 1-2 study of high-dose photoradiation therapy was performed in 23 patients with cerebral tumors. Twenty-two patients had high-grade gliomas (13 glioblastomas, six recurrent glioblastomas, two anaplastic astrocytomas, and one recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma) and one had a right frontal metastasis from a carcinoma of the lung. Hematoporphyrin derivative was administered to these patients in a dose of 5 mg/kg and, 24 hours later, they all underwent a craniotomy with radical excision of the tumor. The tumor bed was then irradiated with 630 nm of laser light from either an argon dye laser or a gold metal vapor laser for between 43 and 94 minutes, receiving total doses of 70 to 120 J/sq cm (six cases) or 120 to 230 J/sq cm (17 cases). The temperature of the tumor bed was kept below 37 degrees C by irrigation. Fifteen patients who developed new tumors underwent postoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 20 divided doses). There was no evidence of increased cerebral edema and no other toxicity from the therapy. All patients were discharged from the hospital within 18 days of surgery. Four of seven patients with gliomas have suffered a further recurrence at 12 to 16 weeks, and two of 15 patients with primarily treated gliomas experienced recurrence at 3 and 13 months following therapy. Fifteen patients have had no recurrence of their tumor and are alive and well at a median follow-up period of 7 months (range 1 to 16 months). It is concluded that photoradiation therapy using 5 mg/kg of hematoporphyrin derivative and 630 nm light at doses of up to 230 J/sq cm can be used as an adjuvant to surgery and radiotherapy with no additional complications.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgical approaches to trigonal arteriovenous malformations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Only about 5% of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) are located predominantly within the ventricular system. Between July, 1981, and February, 1986, 15 patients were treated at the authors' institution for AVM's within the ventricular trigone. The mean age of this patient population was 24 years, and two-thirds were female. Intracranial hemorrhage was by far the most frequent presenting symptom and intraventricular hemorrhage occurred in 11 cases, with multiple episodes being documented in five. Arterial supply of the malformations was quite uniform, with the lateral posterior choroidal or posterior temporal branch of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) being the most frequent source. Venous drainage was similarly stereotypic, with predominant outflow into the galenic system in all but one patient. An interhemispheric surgical approach was used in eight patients, a middle or inferior temporal gyrus incision was performed in six, and a subtemporal route was chosen in a single patient. Operative results suggest that these lesions can be removed with reasonable safety. An interhemispheric approach is recommended if the nidus projects medially from the trigone and is observed medial to the P2-P3 junction of the PCA on angiography. A middle temporal gyrus approach is suggested if the nidus is lateral to the P2-P3 junction, even when the lesion is located in the dominant hemisphere. A subtemporal approach should be reserved for inferiorly projecting AVM's with cortical representation on the fusiform or parahippocampal gyrus in the nondominant hemisphere.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The MRI appearance of cavernous malformations (angiomas).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The angiographic, computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were compared in 10 patients with a total of 16 pathologically verified cavernous angiomas. Only three lesions had abnormal vasculature in the form of venous pooling or a capillary blush. The CT scans were positive in seven patients and detected 14 lesions, while high-field strength (1.5 Tesla) MRI was positive in each case and demonstrated 27 distinct lesions. On T2-weighted MRI, the combination of a reticulated core of mixed signal intensity (SI) with a surrounding rim of decreased SI strongly suggests the diagnosis of a cavernous malformation. Smaller lesions appear as areas of decreased SI (black dots). The sensitivity of MRI is based on magnetic susceptibility and possibly diffusion effects related to field heterogeneity that is more conspicuous on high-field imaging and caused by the presence of excessive iron (hemosiderin).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The rCBF response to Diamox in normal subjects and cerebrovascular disease patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Age-related norms for the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) response to Diamox (acetazolamide) were based on studies of 55 normal subjects at rest and on studies of 33 of these 55 normal subjects following an intravenous injection of Diamox (22 mg/kg). After the Diamox injection, rCBF increased at all locations measured in all subjects. On average, rCBF increased 1.7 times. The following were found for rCBF in both resting and Diamox-treated subjects: 1) rCBF decreased significantly with increasing age; 2) slope and intercept for the regression of rCBF on age were largest for frontal detectors, intermediate for parietal detectors, and smallest for occipital detectors; 3) rCBF hyperfrontality was most noticeable in younger subjects; 4) in subjects of any age, 95% confidence intervals for rCBF were relatively large (expected value +/- 30%) and lower 95% confidence intervals for Diamox rCBF tended to overlap the upper 95% confidence intervals for resting rCBF; and 5) side-to-side percentage difference in rCBF did not have a significant regression on age and tended to be less than 10% to 20%. Diamox did not have an important effect on blood pressure, pulse rate, or respiratory rate. The normative data for the rCBF response to Diamox was used in evaluating 20 patients with cerebrovascular disease. Forty percent of these patients, all of whom exhibited angiographic evidence of potentially hemodynamically significant lesions, had normal rCBF at rest and after Diamox injection. Twenty percent had normal resting flows with abnormal Diamox-activated flows. Asymmetry in rCBF was the most sensitive indicator of a potential abnormality in cerebral perfusion. Thirty percent of the abnormal studies showed only significant asymmetry. It is suggested that rCBF studies at rest and after Diamox treatment, with age-related norms, may be useful in the management of patients with cerebrovascular disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Relationships between intracranial pressure, ventricular size, and resistance to CSF outflow.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 230 patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus, high-pressure hydrocephalus, or benign intracranial hypertension, measurements of the intracranial pressure (ICP), ventricular size, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow resistance (Ro) have revealed a linear relationship between ICP and Ro. It is shown that on average the CSF formation rate tends to decrease with increasing ICP. It is also shown that the size of the ventricles increases as the ICP levels off toward normal values. The clinical implication of this is that a small or normal ventricular size in acute or subacute phases does not preclude defective CSF resorption.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A prospective analysis of 142 carotid endarterectomies for occlusive vascular disease, 1979-1985.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Carotid endarterectomy may carry a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality from major stroke, thus offsetting any statistical benefit in reduction of future stroke. Because of the disturbing ranges in the incidence of stroke morbidity and mortality reported from the several institutional series studying carotid endarterectomy, the authors undertook a prospective review of 142 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed for symptomatic atherosclerotic occlusive vascular disease on the neurosurgical service. The University of Alabama Hospital. Preoperative risk assessment was performed in each case according to the Mayo Clinic classification system. The overall mortality rate was 1.4% and the major stroke morbidity rate was 0.7%, for a combined major morbidity and mortality rate of 2.1%. The incidence of minor neurological morbidity was 1.4%. There was no morbidity or mortality in the Grade I and II (low-risk) patient groups. This low combined major morbidity and mortality rate of 2.1% for carotid endarterectomy causes the surgical stroke-free survival curve to intersect the medical stroke-free survival curve at an earlier point in time, and thus demonstrates the greater reduction in risk of stroke which accrues over time for the surgically treated patient.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Primary cerebellar hemorrhage. Quadrigeminal cistern obliteration on CT scans as a predictor of outcome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors studied a consecutive series of 75 patients with cerebellar hemorrhage diagnosed by computerized tomography (CT) scanning, and assessed the relationship of outcome to the CT appearance of the quadrigeminal cistern, which in some cases was obliterated by rostral displacement of the vermis resulting from the cerebellar mass. Obliteration of the quadrigeminal cisterns was classified on the CT scans into three grades: normal (Grade I), compressed (Grade II), or absent (Grade III). There were 43 patients with Grade I, 16 with Grade II, and 16 with Grade III cisterns. Of the 75 patients, 38 (88.4%) of those with Grade I, 11 (68.8%) of those with Grade II, and none of those with Grade III cisterns returned to their previous activities at 6 months or more after onset. A Grade I cistern predicted a good outcome whether the hematoma was evacuated or not, as long as obstructive hydrocephalus, if present, was relieved early. However, a Grade II cistern was not predictive of a good outcome unless the hematoma was evacuated within 48 hours after onset of the hemorrhage. A Grade III cistern invariably predicted an unfavorable outcome. It is concluded that the CT grade of quadrigeminal cistern obliteration is an accurate indicator of outcome and is highly useful in selecting appropriate treatment for patients with cerebellar hemorrhage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of timing of clot removal on chronic vasospasm in a primate model.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of complete clot removal at times from 48 to 96 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm was evaluated to determine whether there is a critical point after which clot removal is ineffective in preventing vasospasm. Thirty cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to one of five groups: sham-operated group, clot removal at 48 hours after SAH (48-hour group), clot removal at 72 hours after SAH (72-hour group), clot removal at 96 hours after SAH (96-hour group), and clot placement only (clot group). Standard microsurgical techniques were used to dissect bilaterally the major cerebral arteries free of arachnoid. An autologous blood clot averaging 4.2 gm was placed around the vessels in the subarachnoid space of the monkeys in the 48-hour, 72-hour, 96-hour, and clot groups. Physiological saline was instilled into the subarachnoid space of the sham-operated animals. Animals in the clot-removal groups underwent surgical clot removal at the determined times for each group. Two animals in each of the sham-operated and clot groups were subjected to reoperation at each of 48, 72, and 96 hours after SAH. The incisions were reopened and then simply reclosed. Neurological status, angiographic cerebral vessel caliber, and physiological status were evaluated before and 7 days after SAH induction. There were no significant neurological deficits in the sham-operated, 48-hour, or 72-hour groups. Two animals in each of the 96-hour and clot groups showed deterioration in level of consciousness developing on Day 4 or 5 after SAH induction. All the major cerebral arteries of the animals in the clot and 96-hour groups showed significant vasospasm (p less than 0.01) on Day 7. Animals in the 72-hour group had significant vasospasm (p less than 0.05) of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries but not the anterior cerebral arteries. There was no significant vasospasm (p greater than 0.05) in any of the cerebral arteries in the 48-hour group. Severity of vasospasm paralleled the duration of contact between the blood clot and the cerebral vessels. Evacuation of the subarachnoid hematoma later than 48 hours after SAH resulted in no significant reduction in the degree of chronic cerebral vasospasm. It is suggested that clot removal at early operation is likely to be useful only if it is performed within 48 hours of SAH.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of craniectomy on the biomechanics of normal brain.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Does an open skull alter the fundamental biomechanical properties of normal brain tissue? This question was studied in 32 anesthetized cats, 16 of which underwent a standard craniectomy (2.5 X 2.0 cm) in the left frontoparietal region. Brain tissue pressure, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and brain water content were measured from the same area of cortical gray and white matter, and intracranial pressure (ICP) was recorded from the cisterna magna. Brain tissue resistance, tissue compliance, and the pressure-volume index were analyzed in response to a bolus injection of saline into brain tissue or the cisterna magna. Cerebrovascular resistance was also calculated. In craniectomized animals 2 hours after surgery, ICP had fallen to 3.75 +/- 0.39 mm Hg, and cortical gray and white matter tissue pressure had fallen to 3.19 +/- 0.47 and 4.69 +/- 0.54 mm Hg, respectively (mean +/- standard error of the mean); these variables did not fall further over 4 hours. The pressure-volume index in the same animals increased significantly from 0.67 +/- 0.01 to 0.86 +/- 0.04 ml. Tissue compliance rose in the cortical gray matter but tissue resistance fell, approximating that found in subjacent white matter. There was no significant difference between animals with and without craniectomy in rCBF, cerebrovascular resistance, or brain water content in either gray or white matter. These findings indicate that in the cat craniectomy causes an increase in the compensatory capacity of the intracranial cavity to increased volume. The data also indicate that cortical tissue has high hydraulic conductivity and compliance when the skull is opened.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nonsuture microvascular anastomosis using an Nd-YAG laser and a water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol splint.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Anastomosis of rat common carotid artery was performed without sutures, using a neodymium (Nd)-YAG laser at 20 W for 100 msec; this power and exposure had been found optimal in preliminary experiments. An intraluminal intervascular splint made of water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol, which dissolved and disappeared within a few minutes after recirculation of blood, was used for precise "intima-to-intima" coaptation. No stay sutures or glue were required during the procedure. There was a 92% patency rate 24 hours after surgery, and the anastomosed vessels were still patent on the 7th and 30th postoperative days. Complications such as aneurysm formation or stenotic change were negligible. The fusion of the muscle layer and collagen fibers of the media in the anastomosis was confirmed histologically. A tensile strength test immediately following operation and 1 week later showed that this anastomosis was significantly better than that achieved with the usual manual suture method. The major advantages of this technique, combined with use of a water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol splint, are rapidity, consistency of results, and firm fusion with no residual foreign body.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mineralization and biodegradation of CSF shunting systems.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The mineralization and biodegradation of cerebrospinal fluid shunting systems were studied using material from 25 shunts that had been implanted for between 6 days and 10 years. New unused materials were also examined for comparison. Surface changes in six systems could be observed under an operating microscope. Substantial quantities of a white deposit had adhered to the tubing in four of the shunts. These changes were most advanced in the galeal penetrative portion of the shunts and are believed to have been caused by mechanical stress. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed surface wrinkles, microscopic holes, and tiny particles, suggesting deterioration of the material itself. An energy-dispersive analysis using x-rays demonstrated that the surface deposits were due to mineralization of calcium phosphate and that the tiny particle growth was aluminum. These changes may be a consequence of the degradation of silicone rubber. A discriminant analysis of the mineralization was carried out; thus, the age of the host and the duration of system implantation could be correlated with the incidence of mineralization (p less than 0.1). A measurement of the physical properties showed progressive change with a remarkable deterioration in systems implanted for more than 5 years.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Correlates of lung/heart ratio of thallium-201 in coronary artery disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied 306 patients with chest pain (262 with coronary artery disease and 44 with no coronary artery disease) to determine which of 23 clinical, exercise, thallium, and angiographic variables best discriminate between patients with increased lung/heart ratios of thallium versus those with normal ratios. Normal lung/heart ratio values were defined using an additional 45 subjects with less than 1% probability of coronary artery disease. The number of diseased vessels was the best discriminator between patients with increased ratios versus those with normal ratios. Double product at peak exercise, number of segments with abnormal wall motion, patient gender, and duration of exercise were also significant discriminators. Using discriminant function analysis these variables could correctly identify 81% of cases with increased lung/heart ratios and 72% of cases with normal ratios. These results indicate that an increased lung/heart ratio of thallium reflects exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction and affords a better understanding of why this thallium parameter is a powerful prognostic indicator in patients with chest pain.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- In the past few years, we have occasionally observed linear bands in the phase images of gated cardiac blood-pool scans along the interventricular septum region among patients with normal septal motions. Our retrospective study investigated the cause of out-of-phase bands of 12 patients. We documented through review of cines, computer analysis of gated cardiac blood-pool scintigraphy data, and correlation with echocardiograms that this phenomenon was artifact introduced by rotational movements of the heart. It is important for nuclear physicians to recognize this rotational artifact on the phase analysis image in order to avoid the erroneous misdiagnosis of wall motion abnormalities of the septum.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Radiophosphate uptake in asymptomatic knee arthroplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The utility of radiophosphate bone scanning in the detection of complications following total knee replacement (TKR) is not yet fully established. A difficulty associated with the use of bone scanning is the persistent increased uptake seen around the prosthetic joint long after surgery, despite the absence of symptoms. In order to better characterize the time course of radiophosphate uptake, bone scans obtained 1 mo-12 yr after surgery were analyzed in 30 asymptomatic patients with 37 TKR. Uptake was graded 0-4+ in the femoral and tibial components. Scans of 18 implants were obtained 1 yr or less after surgery (Group 1), and 19 were obtained greater than 1 yr after surgery (Group 2). Mean uptake scores were as follows: femoral component Group 1 = 3.0 +/- 1.1; Group 2 = 1.8 +/- 0.9 (p less than 0.05); tibial component Group 1 = 3.2 +/- 0.8; Group 2 = 2.6 +/- 1.1 (not significant). Persistent increased uptake, particularly in the tibial component, reflects mechanical stresses peculiar to knee prostheses, and tends to undermine confidence in diagnosing loosening on the basis of a single study.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Postprandial blush in multiphase bone scanning.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The presence of transient soft-tissue activity in the left side and the lower midportion of the abdomen on the early phases of the multiphase bone scan represents postprandial physiologic hyperemia of the small intestine. The bowel uptake was present in all 33 patients ingesting food between 15 min and 3.5 hr before scanning. In those patients who had not eaten within 4 hr of the study, only 25% demonstrated bowel activity. The observation of bowel uptake is important in differentiating a physiologic phenomenon from pathologic accumulations of activity. Pathology should be ruled out when bowel activity is not located in the usual left flank and lower mid-abdomen, or is present in a fasting individual.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- An osmium-191/iridium-191m radionuclide generator using an oxalato osmate parent complex.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A new osmium-191/iridium-191m (191Os/191mIr) radionuclide generator has been developed that offers high 191mIr yield (greater than 20%/ml) and low 191Os breakthrough (less than 5 X 10(-4)%/ml) when eluted with a solution of 0.001 M oxalic acid and 0.9% (normal) saline. This is the first 191Os/191mIr generator that combines the advantages of high 191mIr yield, extremely low 191Os breakthrough, and an eluate that does not require buffering prior to injection. These improvements in performance were accomplished through use of the chelate transdioxobisoxalatoosmate(VI) as the parent complex on the generator. The clinical result of the combination of higher yield and lower breakthrough is a 100-fold decrease in the estimated patient radiation dose compared with the same study performed with technetium-99m (99mTc), and the injectable eluate makes the generator easier to use. Acute and subacute toxicity studies performed on this generator eluate have shown no adverse effects attributable to the eluate.</ABSTRACT>

- The biodistribution of 3F8, and IgG3 murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for the disialoganglioside GD2, was studied in nude mice xenografted with human neuroblastoma (NB). 3F8 conjugated to radioactive iodine and injected intravenously localized selectively to seven human NB when compared with Ewing's sarcoma and Hela cell xenograft controls. Uptake in NB was shown to be specific for MoAb 3F8 when contrasted with pooled mouse IgG or irrelevant IgG3 MoAb controls. Both small (50 mg) and large tumors greater than 2 g) showed radiolocalization. The percent injected dose uptake per gram tumor ranged from 8 to 50% and was inversely correlated with tumor size. Optimal tumor to normal tissue ratios were reached by 24-48 hr. There was no abnormal uptake in the reticuloendothelial system and the MoAb did not cross the blood-brain barrier. Based on the kinetics of the amount of radioactivity deposited in tissues, the relative radiation dose to normal organs was estimated to be 1% to 20% of the tumor dose. The MoAb 3F8 is useful for targeting radioactivity to human NB in vivo and the nude mice xenograft model may allow optimization of parameters that influence such biodistribution.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Three cases demonstrating the role of gallium scanning in relapsing Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Restaging of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma for chemotherapy traditionally requires chest radiograph and abdominal computerized tomogram (CT) for routine follow-up examination. Although gallium scanning has had a poor record in the past, recent studies suggest that improved techniques have given this method high sensitivity. We present three cases in which gallium correctly staged lymphoma that had been missed or misinterpreted by chest radiographs and abdominal CT. Gallium imaging is useful in follow-up of lymphoma patients especially when the CT scan is difficult to interpret.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metaiodobenzylguanidine as an index of the adrenergic nervous system integrity and function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The radiopharmaceutical, metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) acts as an analog of norepinephrine (NE). Experiments in rats were carried out to determine how closely the movements of [125I]MIBG in the heart mimicked those of [3H]NE, and if the changes [125I] MIBG concentrations would reflect injury to, and function of, adrenergic neurons in the heart. Injury to adrenergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine substantially reduced the uptake of [125I] MIBG into the left ventricle, but the effect was less than that on uptake of [3H]NE uptake and concentration of endogenous NE. Similarly, when desmethylimipramine was given to inhibit the uptake-1 pathway of neurons, the reduction in uptake of [125I]MIBG was statistically significant but less than that of [3H]NE; part of this difference may be attributable to partial uptake of [125I]MIBG into neurons by a diffusion pathway. Substantial fractions of [125I]MIBG and [3H]NE were displaced from the heart by the sympathomimetic drug, phenylpropanolamine. When adrenergic neurons of the heart were stimulated by feeding of rats, the disappearance rates of [3H]NE and [125I]MIBG from the heart were significantly increased. Although not a perfect analog of [3H]NE, [125I]MIBG appears to enter and leave the heart in patterns similar to those of [3H]NE. Thus, movements of [125I]MIBG give indices of adrenergic neuron injury and function in the heart.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metaiodobenzylguanidine to map scintigraphically the adrenergic nervous system in man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) localizes in adrenergic neurons; MIBG labeled with 123I then serves as an analog of norepinephrine, and concentrations of [123I]MIBG reflect sites of adrenergic neurons in organs. Movements of [123I]MIBG into and out of organs were measured by quantitative scintigraphy in man. We perturbed adrenergic neuron function in several ways, and [123I]MIBG concentrations in the heart were subsequently altered in patterns consistent with the concept that [123I]MIBG resides mostly in adrenergic neurons. Uptake of [123I]MIBG into the heart was inhibited by the tricyclic drug, imipramine, and this agent also accelerated the rate of loss of [123I]MIBG. Phenylpropanolamine, a sympathomimetic drug that acts by displacing norepinephrine from neurons, increased the rates of loss of [123I]MIBG from the heart. Exercise was followed by a movement of [123I]MIBG into blood and urine. Generalized autonomic neuropathies were associated with marked diminutions of [123I]MIBG uptake into the heart. We conclude that quantitative scintigraphy in patients will enable determinations of regional disturbances in integrity (by measuring uptake of [123I]MIBG) and function (by measuring rates of loss of [123I]MIBG) of the adrenergic nervous system in the heart.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The impact of utilization review on nursing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- At first glance, nursing's role in UR appears to be of strategic significance to the profession. But there are several issues that nurse executives need to consider. First, since UR departments are seldom part of the nursing department, UR nurses are practicing outside the realm of nursing. What responsibility, if any, does the nursing department have to nurses practicing in the hospital, yet not in the nursing department? What can the nursing department do to help UR nurses maintain their identification with the profession and appreciate the strategic importance of their role, with its legal and financial ramifications? Second, UR is changing the established role of the primary care nurse. In your institution UR may already have taken the staff nurses' discharge planning function. It appears that several factors are contributing to this role change. Patient acuity has increased the time needed to administer physical care. The nursing shortage means more patients are assigned to each professional nurse and paraprofessionals are doing more patient care. There is less and less time left for the primary nurse to practice the professional attributes of nursing, primarily discharge planning. This function is shifting to the UR Department. Is discharge planning a function nurse executives wish to relinquish? Finally, we are entering another period of severe nurse shortages, where recruitment and retention of staff are paramount. Actively competing for our staff are the UR departments. Forty professional nurses work in three regional centers of the American Health Network, American Group Insurance Company (Dallas, Texas). In one hospital of 450 beds, nine nurses are employed by the UR department.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Impaired platelet aggregation and thromboxane generation in essential fatty acid-deficient rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- ADP-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin-induced thromboxane B2 generation in diluted whole blood from rats fed a fat-free diet supplemented with 10% (by weight) hydrogenated coconut oil [essential fatty acid (EFA) deficient] were significantly lower than that in animals fed 10% safflower oil [(SFO) rich in linoleic acid] or 10% marine oil (rich in eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid). Plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly lower and liver function was impaired in the EFA-deficient group compared with the other two groups. Platelet responsiveness to ADP was restored when plasma from the EFA-deficient rats was replaced by plasma obtained from rats fed a nonpurified diet. ADP responsiveness and thrombin-stimulated thromboxane B2 production in diluted whole blood were also restored after 2 wk of injections of 100 mg ethyl linoleate every 48 h, and partially restored by injections of 100 mg ethyl alpha-linolenate. When ADP-induced platelet aggregation was examined in washed platelets, the impaired ADP aggregation (found when platelets of the EFA-deficient rats were suspended in their own plasma) was not observed at either high (9.5 microM) or low (1.0 microM) ADP concentrations. Although thrombin-stimulated thromboxane B2 production in washed platelets in the EFA-deficient rats was lower than that in the SFO-fed rats, the magnitude of aggregation was not different. In addition, inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by apyrase (0.06 U/mL) was identical in the two groups. These results suggest that impaired platelet aggregation in EFA deficiency is related more to plasma factors than to inherent platelet properties and that restoration of normal liver function is associated with normal platelet function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of casein or soybean protein on plasma cholesterol level in jejunectomized or ileectomized rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The contribution of enterohepatic circulation of cholesterol and bile acids in the hypocholesterolemic activity of soybean protein isolate (SPI) was compared with the activity of casein. Intact, sham-operated, jejunectomized or ileectomized adult rats were fed a cholesterol-free, purified diet containing either 20% casein or 20% SPI for 7 or 10 d. For the subsequent 7 d the diets were reversed. In intact rats the plasma cholesterol concentration (p-chol) was significantly higher when the casein diet was fed than when the SPI diet was fed. Within 3 d after the diet crossover, p-chol in each group of intact rats reached rapidly the same level as that in its previous counterpart. These rapid inherent responses of p-chol to the casein and SPI diets remained unchanged even when the jejunum or the ileum was resected, and p-chol in jejunectomized or ileectomized rats was similar to that found in sham-operated rats. The extent of the change in p-chol induced by exchanging dietary proteins was almost the same among intact, sham-operated, jejunectomized and ileectomized rats. These findings indicate that the interruption of enterohepatic circulation of cholesterol and bile acids is not the major factor involved in the differential effects of dietary proteins on p-chol.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Thyroid function, energy balance, body composition and organ growth in protein-deficient chicks.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Protein-deficient diets (17, 10, 6.5 or 3% protein) and a 24% control diet were fed to growing chicks. A control group was pair-fed daily with each deficient group. Energy intake was lower in the 6.5 and 3% protein groups than in the other groups. However, weight gain, bone growth and feed conversion efficiency were lower with 10% protein or less. Relative thyroid weights were unaffected by dietary protein. Plasma T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) levels were significantly higher in all deficient groups, whereas plasma T4 (thyroxine) was lower. Plasma rT3 (reverse T3) was unaffected by the protein deficiencies, suggesting that enhanced conversion of T4 to T3 rather than to rT3 had occurred. Hepatic alpha-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GP) shuttle activity increased markedly in protein-deficient chicks. Efficiency of energy utilization was unaltered in chicks fed 17 or 10% protein but was higher in chicks fed 6.5 and 3% protein than in controls. All deficient chicks had more fat and less protein and water in the tissues. The lower feed conversion efficiency therefore represents almost entirely a shift in body composition toward fat and does not reflect a loss of energy as heat. We conclude that elevations in plasma T3 and in thyroid-controlled alpha-GP shuttle activity, although sensitive indicators of protein deficiencies, are not good predictors of altered thermogenic activity in protein-deficient chicks.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metabolism of methionine and methionine hydroxy analogue by porcine kidney fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Porcine kidney fibroblasts in culture are able to utilize the 2-hydroxy analog of methionine (MHA) as the sole methionine source, but higher concentrations of MHA than methionine are required. The optimal concentration for growth with L-methionine ranges from 0.02 to 1.0 mM, whereas that for DL-MHA is 7.5 mM. At concentrations above 1.0 mM, L-methionine exhibits a toxic effect. Supplementing 1.0 mM L-methionine with DL-MHA allows greater growth than that provided by an equimolar concentration of L-methionine alone, and no toxic effect is seen at methionine source (DL-MHA) concentrations up to 7.5 mM. Early in the growth phase of cells where DL-MHA is the sole source of methionine, a 48-h lag period is observed over that seen in cells grown in the presence of 1.0 mM L-methionine. After the lag period, the MHA-supplemented cells double at the same rate as the methionine-supplemented cells. Studies with the purified isomers of D- and L-MHA indicate that only the D-isomer is utilized by these fibroblasts.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Specific effect of guar gum or gum arabic on adaptation of cecal digestion to high fiber diets in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The objective of this work was to examine whether the nature of fiber may influence the cecal digestion in the rat fed hydrocolloids such as gums. Adaptation to a high fiber diet containing 15% guar gum (GG) or gum arabic (GA) was thus studied in rats previously adapted to a high starch fiber-free diet. Both gums elicited a marked enlargement of the cecum and a trophic effect on the cecal wall. The cecal pH dropped to 5.8, then plateaued to about 6.1. During the first days of adaptation, a part of GA escaped microbial degradation; thereafter the cecal pool of volatile fatty acids (VFA) was similar with both diets (approximately equal to 1000 mumol). GA promoted propionate-rich fermentations, whereas GG rather enhanced acetic and butyric fermentations. VFA absorption was higher with the gum diets than with the control diet, because blood flow increased in parallel to the weight of cecal wall. K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were absorbed in large amounts from the cecum, particularly in rats fed the GA diet. With this diet, high concentrations of nonsoluble Ca2+ and phosphate (but low concentrations of soluble phosphate) were found in the cecum. The study indicates that gums have potent effects on digestion in the large bowel, and that there are specific effects of the different types of gums.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mechanisms of absorption, transport and tissue uptake of RRR-alpha-tocopherol and d-gamma-tocopherol in the white rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The metabolism of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol was studied in three groups of rats that were fed a modified AIN-76 diet containing normal (NE, 0.2 g alpha-tocopherol/kg), high (HE, 1.0 g alpha-tocopherol/kg) or low (LE, less than 0.02 alpha-tocopherol/kg) vitamin E for 3 mo. After 1, 2 and 3 d of an oral dose of 20 mg of alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol or both, the levels of the two vitamers were measured in plasma and tissues and in some cases in isolated microsomal and mitochondrial fractions from liver. Twenty-four hours after an oral dose of 20 mg gamma-tocopherol the levels of alpha-tocopherol in plasma and tissues remained constant and higher levels of gamma-tocopherol were found in tissues in which low alpha-tocopherol levels could be found such as in the LE group. In spite of this, it was enabled to remain there, after 2 and 3 d gamma-tocopherol had decreased levels in all tissues. When given in combination with alpha-tocopherol, the levels of gamma-tocopherol were lower than when gamma-tocopherol was given alone. Microsomes and mitochondria from livers of LE group bound five and nine times more alpha-tocopherol than gamma-tocopherol in rats dosed with equal amount of alpha- or gamma-tocopherol, respectively. These data indicate that the mechanisms that regulate the metabolism of vitamin E are highly specific for alpha-tocopherol. Moreover, the relative amount of alpha-tocopherol determined the levels of gamma-tocopherol in tissues. However, the retention of gamma-tocopherol in tissues did not depend on the presence of alpha-tocopherol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Uptake and release of adrenal ascorbic acid in the guinea pig after injection of ACTH.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of a single injection of ACTH (3 IU/100 g body weight) on the distribution of ascorbic acid (AA) and radiolabeled AA in 20 tissues was studied in adult male guinea pigs consuming 500 mg AA/kg diet. Saline- or ACTH-injected animals were simultaneously injected with [1-14C]AA, and killed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after injection. There was no significant difference between treatments in the weight of any tissue over the 6-h experimental period. As anticipated, the concentration of AA in the adrenals of animals injected with ACTH was 33% of that of animals injected with saline at 4 h. Unexpectedly, the concentration of radiolabeled AA in the adrenals at 0.5 h after ACTH injection was 172% of that after saline injection. The concentration of radiolabeled AA in the adrenal of the saline-injected animals increased slowly over time to reach a level similar to that of ACTH-injected animals by 6 h. There was no effect of ACTH on the level of AA or uptake in any of the other tissues examined. These results demonstrate that a single dose of ACTH markedly influences the retention of AA in the adrenal gland without similarly altering retention of AA in other tissues. Furthermore, ACTH treatment causes both accelerated uptake and release of AA into the adrenals.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of cimetidine on tissue distribution of some trace elements and minerals in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cimetidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that is used in the treatment of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers and other hypersecretory conditions. This drug has a structure that suggests that it could act as a chelating agent. To examine its effects on trace metal and mineral metabolism, 38 weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of five treatment groups. These were a high dose [(HD) 1750 mg/(kg X d)] group, HD pair-fed control (HDPF) group, intermediate dose [(ID) 875 mg/(kg X d)] group, ID pair-fed (IDPF) group and low dose [(LD) 87.5 mg/kg X d)] group. In a separate experiment, 20 female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of two treatment groups: a high dose cimetidine group [(HDFem) 1750 mg/kg X d)] and a pair-fed control group (PFFem). Cimetidine was administered intragastrically four times per week for 5 wk. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) found among groups for the male rats studied included higher plasma copper in the HD and the ID groups, higher plasma sodium, liver copper, heart calcium and heart zinc in the HD group and a lower percentage of fecal excretion of all the divalent metals studied in the HD and the ID groups than in their pair-fed controls. Pathologic examination of the liver revealed extensive fatty infiltration of liver cells, liver cell necrosis and disrupture of liver lobular architecture in the HD group. Cimetidine-dosed females had higher zinc in heart and plasma, higher copper in heart, kidney, liver, jejunum, ileum and uterus, higher manganese in stomach and ileum, lower iron in kidney and liver, lower kidney calcium and higher stomach calcium and lower liver magnesium compared with their pair-fed controls. Levels of liver and kidney metallothionein in the two groups were comparable. Male and female rats receiving high dose cimetidine experienced significant changes in tissue concentrations of some of the trace metals and minerals studied.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of maternal zinc supply on blood and tissue metallothionein I concentrations in suckling rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Changes in metallothionein I (MT-I) levels were measured in blood and tissues of rat pups from dams given diets containing 6, 9 or 40 mg zinc/kg from wk 1 or gestation and throughout lactation. After 1, 2 and 3 wk of lactation, litters from each group were killed and tissues analyzed for MT-I. The relatively mild degree of zinc deficiency, which had no effect on fetal viability or litter size and caused only slightly lower pup weight, caused significantly lower MT-I concentrations in pup liver, thymus, plasma and red cells, particularly in pups from dams receiving 6 mg zinc/kg. Maternal zinc supply is therefore a major determinant of MT-I concentrations in neonatal tissues, and assay of this protein in blood plasma and red cells may give a useful indication of zinc status.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A possible synergism of dietary phosphate and urine-acidifying salts in preventing silica urolithiasis in a rat model.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Using an animal model involving rats fed tetraethylorthosilicate, the minimal effective dietary concentration of ammonium chloride for reduction of silica urolithiasis was determined to be approximately 0.10 equivalents/kg diet. Ammonium sulfate appeared to be only slightly less effective. The lower incidences of urolithiasis were associated with urinary pH less than 7. A subprophylactic concentration (0.067 equivalents/kg diet) of ammonium chloride was factored with three levels of supplemental phosphorus (0, 0.15 and 0.30%) from Na2HPO4 to determine whether the antiurolithic effects of dietary phosphate and urinary-acidifying salts are synergistic. Phosphate had no effect on urinary pH. A 50% urolith incidence occurred in controls; the incidence was 25% (P = 0.08) with 0.15 and 10% (P less than 0.01) with 0.30% phosphorus. Urinary pH was 7.5 in controls compared with approximately 7.2 in rats given the subprophylactic level of ammonium chloride, but ammonium chloride alone had no effect on urolithiasis. However, complete protection from urolithiasis was provided by each of the two levels of phosphorus in combination with ammonium chloride. It is concluded that supplemental dietary phosphorus is most effective for protection against silica urolithiasis under conditions contributing toward urinary acidification due to a possible synergism between dietary phosphorus and urinary acidifying salts.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dose-response relations in urinary excretion of trimethylselenonium in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 75Se-labeled selenite was administered to fasting rats by orogastric intubation (1.5-3000 micrograms/kg body wt). Urine was collected and characterized for total radioactivity as well as for radiolabeled trimethylselenonium (TMSe). At lower doses of selenite (up to 500 micrograms/kg body wt), 30% of the administered dose was excreted. At higher doses of selenite, fractional urine excretion decreased as a function of the dose. The observed decrease in fractional urine excretion was not caused by changes in the absorption of the administered radiolabel. There was a direct relationship between the amount of the administered dose of selenite (up to 1500 micrograms/kg body wt) and the proportion of urinary [75Se] excreted as TMSe. Pretreatment with seleno compounds (10 or 100 micrograms Se/kg body wt as selenite, or selenomethionine) for 35 d before a challenge dose of [75Se]selenite did not influence the excretion of total [75Se] or of [75Se]TMSe in urine. Ingestion of a choline-deficient diet, which should deplete the availability of methyl groups, did not have any effect on excretion of total [75Se] or of [75Se]TMSe in urine after a challenge dose of [75Se]selenite (500 micrograms/kg body wt). The data presented here permit the following conclusions: 1) Production of TMSe is dose dependent, 2) production of TMSe from a single acute dose does not depend on the history of selenium intake and 3) rats fed a methyl-deficient diet are able to eliminate Se via formation of TMSe.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Induction of ceruloplasmin synthesis by retinoic acid in rats: influence of dietary copper and vitamin A status.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing acute phase plasma protein, has been shown to be regulated by 13-cis retinoic acid in rats. Ceruloplasmin activity was significantly increased within 24 h and remained elevated for at least 72 h after a single injection of 13-cis retinoic acid. With daily injections of retinoic acid, the ceruloplasmin activity continued to increase for at least 4 d. After 4 d, the activity was four times control levels. In copper-deficient rats, the ceruloplasmin activity did not increase in response to retinoic acid unless copper was also given to these rats 8 h after retinoic acid. Actinomycin D blocked the retinoic acid-induced stimulation of ceruloplasmin activity in copper-sufficient rats, but in copper-deficient rats only about half of the increase was blocked when the rats were given copper or copper and retinoic acid. By use of pulse-labeling techniques, ceruloplasmin synthesis was shown to increase 1.5-fold after retinoic acid and this increase was blocked by actinomycin D. When vitamin A-deficient rats were repleted with 13-cis retinoic acid for 3 or 5 d, both the ceruloplasmin activity and synthesis were significantly stimulated when compared to the nonrepleted, deficient rats. Therefore, the dietary components, copper and vitamin A, play an important role in the regulation of plasma ceruloplasmin levels.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sodium deprivation growth failure in the rat: alterations in tissue composition and fluid spaces.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Dietary control of sodium intake was utilized in weanling rats to study the relationships among body growth, tissue composition and extracellular fluid volume (ECFV). Forty 3-wk-old rats were divided into groups receiving 30, 150, 300, 600 or 900 mu eq sodium/d for 5 wk. The minimal daily requirement for normal growth was 300 mu eq Na, or about 60 mu eq/g of new growth. Lower doses caused dose-related growth failure associated with a reduced ECFV. Analyses of carcass, muscle and bone composition were carried out. In sodium-deprived animals there was retarded growth of protoplasm, fat and bone; the mineral composition of muscle was not altered, whereas in bone calcium concentration was reduced. Plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride remained normal. Pair-feeding indicated that sodium-deficiency growth retardation could not be attributed to starvation. Sodium-deficient animals ingested a greater amount of food per gram of weight gain, possibly reflecting an increased energy expenditure. Sodium deprivation initially permitted protoplasmic growth to proceed at a rate disproportionate to that of the ECFV. Subsequently, both continued to grow at a reduced but similar rate, suggesting that ECFV may be a controller of protoplasmic growth.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Number of days of food intake records required to estimate individual and group nutrient intakes with defined confidence.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The number of days of food intake data needed to estimate the intake of 29 male (n = 13) and female (n = 16) adult subjects, individually and as a group, was determined for food energy and 18 nutrients. The food intake records were collected in a year-long study conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center. Each individual's average intake of nutrients and standard deviation over the year were assumed to reflect his or her "usual" intake and day-to-day variability. Confidence intervals (P less than 0.05) for each individual's usual intake were constructed, and from these the number of days of dietary records needed for estimated individual and group intake to be within 10% of usual intake was calculated. The results indicated that the number of days of food intake records needed to predict the usual nutrient intake of an individual varied substantially among individuals for the same nutrient and within individuals for different nutrients; e.g., food energy required the fewest days (averaging 31) and vitamin A the most (averaging 433). This was considerably higher than the number of days needed to estimate mean nutrient intake for this group, which ranged from 3 for food energy to 41 for vitamin A. Fewer days would be needed for larger groups.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Febrile inpatients: house officers' use of blood cultures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The so-called "fever work-up" is time-consuming and costly. The authors examined the practices of medical house officers in obtaining blood cultures, an important part of this evaluation, as well as the ability of these physicians to predict bacteremia in febrile patients. They studied all 344 medical inpatients who experienced episodes of fever during two 30-day periods, as well as all 50 cases of bacteremia detected during these and two additional 30-day periods. House officers drew blood for culture within one day after the onset of fever in 52% of fever episodes. In 20% of these episodes only one set of cultures (representing one venipuncture) was obtained. House officers estimated the likelihood of bacteremia to be 20% or less in 15 of 40 bacteremic patients. They failed to obtain blood cultures promptly in 10% of bacteremic episodes and in 27% of episodes where the cause of fever was a nonbacteremic bacterial infection. They obtained prompt blood cultures in only a bare majority of febrile episodes, frequently underestimated the likelihood of bacteremia, and inadequately sampled blood for bacteremia. In this study, clinical judgment was not an adequate substitute for routinely obtaining blood cultures for febrile medical inpatients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of medication compliance on the control of hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of medication-taking patterns on blood pressure was investigated in 24 hypertensive outpatients being treated with once-daily doses of hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. Medication-taking patterns were measured with a small pill dispenser that electronically records the time of medication removal. Blood pressure reduction was found to correlate better with the total number of doses the patient removed from the pill pack during a month than with any of four other compliance measures that were based on the timing of dose removal. Analysis also suggested that blood pressure is improved if patients ingest omitted doses to "catch up" to the prescribed regimen. It is concluded that a simple pill count may be the most clinically relevant definition of compliance for patients with hypertension being treated with only hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, and that such patients should ingest all prescribed doses, regardless of the time interval between doses.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effects of a cost-education program on hospital charges.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An educational intervention designed to change physicians' use of inpatient services was implemented on two general medical services for a year. The intervention consisted of a brief orientation to cost containment issues, a pamphlet that outlined practical cost containment strategies and listed the charges for commonly ordered tests and services, and access to detailed interim patients' bills generated during the hospitalization. Two concurrent control services received no intervention. Over 1,600 admissions were evaluated. The geometric mean length of stay was 0.61 days shorter on intervention services compared with control (5.15 vs. 5.76 days, p less than 0.01). The geometric mean hospital charges were $388 less for intervention patients ($3,199 vs. $3,587, p less than 0.005). Neither patients' demographic characteristics nor case mix could explain the reductions. The authors conclude that a simple program utilizing information already in existence in most hospitals can result in a significant and meaningful reduction in length of stay and charges.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Six-month outcomes for medical patients with major depressive disorders.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The courses of depressive disorders and factors affecting recovery rates among patients treated in primary medical care facilities have rarely been studied. The authors investigated the clinical status of 274 patients initially and six months after they sought care at one of three primary care sites. Through use of the highly structured Diagnostic Interview Schedule, they found that physicians assigned a depressive diagnosis to only a fourth of the patients so assessed by the structured interview. Nevertheless, the rates of persisting major depressive disorders at follow-up were found to be very similar for patients whom both the structured interview and the physician initially considered depressed and those so diagnosed by structured interview but not by the physician (25% and 31%, respectively). An analysis of factors associated with course of illness suggests that psychiatric status at the initial assessment and the number of assigned medical diagnoses rather than the physician's recognition and treatment of depression strongly predict continued affective disorder.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physician's interviewing styles and medical information obtained from patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This paper investigates the association between physicians' interviewing styles and medical information obtained during simulated patient encounters. The sources of data are audiotapes and transcripts of two standardized patient cases presented by trained patient simulators to 43 primary care practitioners. Transcripts were scored for physician proficiency using expert-generated criteria and were content-analyzed to assess the process of communication and information content. Relevant patient disclosure was also scored from the transcripts based on expert-generated criteria. Findings were: 1) On the whole, physicians elicited only slightly more than 50% of the medical information considered important according to expert consensus, with a range from 9% to 85%. 2) Both open and closed questions were substantially related to patient disclosure of medical information to the physician, but open questions were substantially more so (Pearson correlations of 0.37 and 0.72, respectively). 3) Patient education, particularly information regarding prognosis, cause, and prevention, was substantially related to patient disclosure of medical information to the physician (Pearson correlations of 0.44, 0.36, and 0.34, respectively). 5) Finally, clinical expertise was only weakly associated with patient disclosure of medical information to the physician (Pearson correlation of 0.16).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The relationship between features of residency training and ABIM certifying examination performance.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to provide data concerning the relationship between features of residency training and a test of cognitive achievement gathered at the end of residency. To accomplish this, data collected in the late 1970s by three national organizations were joined and analyzed with the aid of experts in internal medicine. Although graduate medical education has evolved since this information was gathered, it does provide a baseline for assessing the impact of changes on the cognitive skills of residents. The findings suggest that better program performance on the examination is associated with attracting more knowledgeable residents to begin with and that programs are able to maintain the advantage of their residents throughout training. Moreover, program characteristics have an impact on the cognitive skills of residents over and above what would be predicted by test scores at the end of medical school. Programs with better examination performance tend to provide residents an extensive, well-supervised educational experience stressing ambulatory care.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The relationship of patient characteristics to physician delivery of advice to stop smoking.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To investigate the frequency of physician delivery of advice to stop smoking and patient characteristics affecting whether physicians deliver such advice, the authors surveyed 97 current cigarette smokers seen in two specialty and one general medicine clinic at a university medical center. Approximately two thirds of the smokers reported ever having been advised to stop smoking by their current physicians. In univariate and multivariate analyses, the presence of a smoking-related illness, the number of prior attempts to quit, and the duration of cigarette smoking were significantly related to delivery of smoking cessation advice by physicians. Knowledge of factors that affect the provision of advice to stop smoking can be used to enhance the physician's role in smoking intervention.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Energy expenditure of patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Resting energy expenditure was measured by open-circuit indirect calorimetry in 71 patients, aged 8.9 to 35.5 years, with cystic fibrosis who had no recent history of acute lung infection. Pulmonary function and nutritional status were studied simultaneously. In most patients, resting energy expenditure was above normal (range 95% to 153% of predicted values for age, sex, and weight as derived from the Harris Benedict equations), and was negatively correlated with pulmonary function (P less than 0.01) and nutritional status (P less than 0.01) when expressed as a percentage of body fat. Pulmonary status was positively correlated with nutritional status (P less than 0.01). We conclude that resting energy expenditure in patients with cystic fibrosis exceeds normal values and that the increase correlates with a deterioration in lung function and nutritional status.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Severe hypervitaminosis A in siblings: evidence of variable tolerance to retinol intake.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 2-year-old boy had signs and symptoms of chronic hypervitaminosis A. A course of increasing severity led to eventual death. A younger brother later had similar clinical features. Chicken liver spread containing up to 420 IU/g vitamin A was the likely source of intoxication. Markedly elevated circulating retinyl ester levels have persisted in the surviving sibling for 3 subsequent years despite severe restriction of vitamin A intake. A therapeutic trial of the carbohydrate-derived complexing agent 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was initiated. Circulating retinyl esters transiently increased during the infusion (from 407 to 4791 micrograms/dL), and urinary total vitamin A excretion, undetectable before infusion, increased to 23 micrograms/dL after infusion. The frequency of hypervitaminotic episodes has decreased somewhat in the 2 years since the infusion, probably related to dietary vitamin A restriction. The occurrence of this syndrome in two brothers, while a sister ingesting the same diet remains completely healthy, suggests an inherited variance in tolerance to vitamin A intake.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Five years' experience with continuous ambulatory or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 93 children, end-stage renal disease was treated with the new dialytic methods of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) over 5 years. Modality survival rates at 36 months with CAPD, CCPD, or both were 20%, 93%, and 87%, respectively. Use of CCPD as the primary dilaytic method increased during the study period. The peritonitis rate was one episode per 11.8 patient treatment months and was similar with both CAPD and CCPD. Gram-positive organisms were cultured in 34% of these episodes of peritonitis. Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis was associated with a recurrence rate of 40% and led to catheter replacement in 45% of the episodes. Peritoneal membrane failure necessitating switching to hemodialysis was related to peritonitis in three patients. Of the 74 peritoneal catheters that required replacement, 70% were infected. Serial serum levels of urea nitrogen, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase remained stable, whereas serum creatinine level rose slightly over time. Episodes of hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia were observed at a frequency of one episode per 12.2, 4.6, and 2.5 treatment months, respectively. Blood transfusions were required in once per 1.5 and 3.3 treatment months in seven anephric patients and in 35 patients with their own kidneys, respectively (P = 0.05). In prepubertal patients who received CAPD or CCPD for greater than 1 year, little or no improvement in growth occurred in relationship to either chronologic or bone age.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nonfamilial hematuria associated with glomerular basement membrane alterations characteristic of hereditary nephritis: comparison with hereditary nephritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Characteristic ultrastructural alterations of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) have been reported in hereditary nephritis and in children without a family history of renal disease. The clinical features, renal biopsy findings, and subsequent course were studied retrospectively in 48 children with such GBM changes to compare findings in those with and without a family history of nephritis and to determine the significance of the GBM changes in patients with nonfamilial disease. All 48 patients had hematuria. For 30, there was hematuria in at least one other member of the family (familial hematuria group); for 18, there was no familial incidence. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to clinical and pathologic findings. At the latest follow-up six boys with familial hematuria and three boys with nonfamilial hematuria had reduced renal function, and nine boys with familial hematuria and four boys and one girl with nonfamilial hematuria had neurosensory deafness. Our study results show that children with these GBM changes, with or without a family history of hematuria, tend to have a progressive course, with frequent occurrence of neurosensory deafness, and that the prognosis is more severe in boys. These observations suggest that such GBM changes in patients with nonfamilial hematuria may represent new mutations for hereditary nephritis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pulmonary function in thalassemia major.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pulmonary function tests were evaluated in 28 Chinese patients with beta-thalassemia major receiving regular transfusions and desferoxamine, and in 34 height-matched normal Chinese children. Comparison of lung function using analysis of covariance with reference to standing height showed that patients with thalassemia had a proportional decrease in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory flow volume in 1 second, whereas their expiratory flow rates, residual volume, and total lung capacity were comparable to those in normal children. The single-breath carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was normal. Our findings suggest that children with thalassemia major have mild restrictive lung disease. The previous controversy regarding the presence of restrictive or obstructive lung disease in patients with thalassemia may be related to the use of inappropriate control values.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The association of ectrodactyly and absence of long bones of the upper or lower extremities has been recognized previously in nine families. We report 24 additional individuals in four families who are similarly affected. Two of these families manifest the unusual feature of unilateral preaxial polydactyly of a lower extremity. Data from these four families plus the nine previously reported suggest that ectrodactyly associated with absence of long bones of the upper or lower limbs is a genetically determined disorder, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with widely variable expression or nonpenetrance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Perinatal cocaine and methamphetamine exposure: maternal and neonatal correlates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Maternal and neonatal growth, behavior, and physiologic organization were evaluated in 104 mother-infant pairs with positive results of urine toxicology screens. ANOVA comparison of cocaine, methamphetamine, and cocaine plus methamphetamine groups revealed no significant differences in perinatal variables. The Finnegan withdrawal scoring scheme demonstrated that all three groups of infants had altered neonatal behavioral patterns, characterized by abnormal sleep patterns, poor feeding, tremors, and hypertonia. Infants exposed to cocaine or methamphetamine or both were combined and compared with both narcotic-exposed and drug-free mother-infant pairs matched for known maternal risk factors. All drug-exposed groups had significantly higher rates of prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation and smaller head circumferences than did the drug-free comparison group. A significantly higher rate of placental hemorrhage occurred in the cocaine plus methamphetamine group. Stepwise multiple regression analysis assessed the independent contribution of maternal factors; cocaine or methamphetamine was adversely, negatively associated with gestational age, birth weight, length, and occipitofrontal circumference. The increased rate of prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and perinatal complications associated with perinatal exposure to cocaine or methamphetamine was greater than that predicted by coexisting risk factors and was consistent with the pharmacologic properties of these drugs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cardiovascular effects of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm lambs with respiratory distress.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We created a model for studying the cardiovascular and pulmonary effects of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature lambs with respiratory distress. In 47 fetal lambs at 129 to 133 days gestation (term, 145 days), we infiltrated the ductus arteriosus with formalin and placed a mechanical occluder about it so that its patency could be regulated. Two days later the lambs were delivered, given sheep surfactant, paralyzed, and their lungs mechanically ventilated. These premature lambs could more than double their left ventricular output when challenged with increasing degrees of left-to-right shunts through the PDA. This was accomplished by an increase in stroke volume, not by an increase in heart rate. During the 40-minute observation period, there was no change in dynamic compliance or functional residual capacity while the ductus was patent. When the ductus was patent, there was a significant increase in arterial PaO2 (even with small left-to-right shunts) and a decrease in PaCO2 (with large shunts). Despite the heart's ability to handle the increased volume load of a PDA, there were significant alterations in individual organ blood flows, resulting from a combination of decreased perfusion pressure and localized vasoconstriction. The abdominal organs had significant reductions in blood flow even with small PDA shunts. This decrease in organ blood flow may explain some of the pathophysiologic manifestations of PDA in preterm infants.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Bupivacaine and lidocaine blockade of calcium-mediated slow action potentials in guinea pig ventricular muscle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on the slow-rising action potentials, induced by superfusion with high-K+ (26 mM) Tyrode's solution with 10(-6) M isoproterenol, were studied in guinea pig ventricular muscle. The concentrations of bupivacaine or lidocaine necessary to result in a 50% depression of the maximum upstroke velocity were about 10(-5) and 10(-4) M, respectively. The concentrations necessary to completely block the slow action potentials were about 10(-4) M for bupivacaine and 5 X 10(-4) M for lidocaine. The relative potencies of lidocaine to bupivacaine in abolishment of the slow action potentials are in the ratio of 1:5. These results suggest that local anesthetics do affect the slow Ca++ channel of ventricular muscle.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Selective ganglionic blockade of vagal inputs to sinoatrial and/or atrioventricular regions.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Vagal postganglionic neurons to sinoatrial (SAN) and atrioventricular (AVN) nodal regions of the canine heart have been localized surgically around the right pulmonary vein-atrial fat pad and in the fat pad overlying the epicardium at the inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial junction, respectively. Local ganglionic blocking doses (total of 5 mg per injection) of hexamethonium were injected into the pulmonary vein-atrial fat pad to block selectively right and left vagal inputs to the SAN region without interrupting vagal inputs to AVN. Conversely, hexamethonium injected into the inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial pad selectively blocked vagal control of arteriovenous conduction without interfering seriously with vagal control of SAN function. Vagal ganglia situated in pulmonary vein-atrial fat pad also exercise moderate but incomplete control of right atrial contractile force. Lesser vagal control of atrial inotropism is localized in the inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial fat pad. Ganglia situated in a large fat pad on the dorsal epicardial surface of the left atrium (left atrial fat pad) appear to play little or no role in SAN or AVN regulation, although some left preganglionic axons may pass through it en route to the AVN region. Vagal stimulation is associated with prompt and profoundly negative chronotropic and dromotropic responses, but in response to the same stimulation, a negative change in atrial contractile force is much slower in development and is much longer lasting. Such precise anatomical localization and differentiation of the intrinsic vagal regulation of SAN, AVN and contractile force opens new avenues of research on the neural regulation of cardiac performance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Differential effects of phenobarbital on ester and ether glucuronidation of diflunisal in rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relative contribution of ether and ester glucuronidation to diflunisal metabolism was assessed by studying the effects of enzyme inducers, phenobarbital (PB), 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and beta-naphthoflavone (BNF). Treatment with either PB, 3-MC or BNF increased markedly the unbound intrinsic clearance of diflunisal. Saline-treated control rats showed a greater unbound intrinsic clearance of diflunisal than oil-treated controls indicating that repetitive treatment with oil had an effect on enzyme activity. Treatment with 3-MC and BNF appeared to cause a decrease in the biliary clearance of ether and ester glucuronide, but PB had little effect on the biliary clearance of glucuronides. Rats pretreated with PB showed a 3-fold increase in the fractional metabolite formation clearance of ether glucuronide and a 2-fold increase in the fractional metabolite formation clearance of ester glucuronide, suggesting differential effects of PB on ester and ether glucuronidation. A similar trend, but to a smaller extent, was also observed for 3-MC- and BNF-treated rats. These results suggest the possibility of selective induction of multiple forms of UDP-glucuronyltransferase involved in metabolism of diflunisal.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Characteristics and distribution of specific binding sites for leukotriene C4 in human bronchi.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The binding of [3H]leukotriene (LT) C4 to membranes from human bronchi has been characterized. The specific binding, measured at 4 degrees C, was very rapid, equilibrium being attained within 1 to 5 min. The binding was also rapidly reversible and saturable (maximum binding = 187 pmol/mg of protein). LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and the LT antagonist FPL 55712 competed with [3H]LTC4 for its binding sites, with the following IC50 values: 0.12; 2.3; 30; and 20 microM. Therefore, the binding sites displayed a higher affinity for LTC4 than for the other sulfidopeptide LTs. Computer-assisted analysis of either the saturation or the competition curves for LTC4 indicated the existence of two classes of binding sites with different affinities (Kd1 and Kd2 = 70 nM and 0.58 microM, respectively), in agreement with the curved semilog plot of the dissociation time course. CaCl2 or MgCl2 increased and GTP or 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate did not decrease the specific binding. In addition, the distribution of the binding sites for [3H]LTC4 along the human respiratory tree was investigated. At a fixed (10 nM) [3H]LTC4 concentration, membranes obtained from bronchi removed at different levels of the airway tree did not bind LTC4 in a significantly different amount. This is compatible with the finding that LTC4 receptors should be present on bronchi of various caliber, as both small and large airways respond to LTs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparative analysis of beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist potency and selectivity of cicloprolol, xamoterol and pindolol.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The partial beta adrenoceptor agonist properties of cicloprolol, xamoterol and pindolol have been compared in vivo (anesthetized catecholamine-depleted or pithed rats) and in vitro (guinea pig or rat right atria and guinea pig tracheal muscle preparations) conditions. All three compounds increased heart rate in the former preparations, and their intrinsic activities relative to isoproterenol were 0.7, 0.65 and 0.45, respectively. The positive chronotropic effects of cicloprolol or xamoterol were competitively antagonized by betaxolol or propranolol; however, part of those induced by pindolol were resistant to these beta adrenoceptor antagonists. None of these compounds increased the spontaneous beating rate of isolated guinea pig atria; however, xamoterol only increased heart rate in isolated rat atria, and its intrinsic activity with respect to isoproterenol was 0.4. Pindolol, xamoterol and cicloprolol behaved as competitive beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists against isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in a pithed rat model. In order to mimic the intrinsic effects of the partial agonist drugs, control dose-response curves for isoproterenol were determined in pithed rats in which the base-line heart rate was elevated by thoracic spinal cord stimulation. In this in vivo preparation, xamoterol and pindolol were more potent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists than cicloprolol; however, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were selective for beta-1 adrenoceptors. In isolated spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria, cicloprolol and xamoterol were equipotent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists but were about 50 times less potent than pindolol. In isolated rat atria, the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist potency of xamoterol was greater (pA2 = 8.7) than in guinea pig atria (pA2 = 7.8). The potencies of cicloprolol and pindolol did not vary between these species. In catecholamine-depleted rats, high i.v. doses of cicloprolol had vasodilator activity that was partly mediated by beta-2 adrenoceptors. In carbachol-contracted guinea pig trachea, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were relatively inactive against isoproterenol-induced relaxation. In conclusion, cicloprolol and xamoterol, similarly to pindolol, behave as agonists and antagonists of beta-1 adrenoceptors. However, only cicloprolol and xamoterol show an elevated degree of selectivity toward the beta-1 adrenoceptor subtype.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of L-652,731, a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, on PAF- and complement-induced pulmonary hypertension in sheep.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema, arterial hypoxia and pulmonary leukostasis occur in response to the infusion of plasma containing zymosan-activated complement (ZAP) in sheep. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potential mediator of some of these effects. We investigated the effects of PAF infusions in unanesthetized sheep and the effects of the PAF receptor antagonist L-652,731 [trans-2,5-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran] on the hematologic, hemodynamic and biochemical alterations produced by infusions of both ZAP and PAF. Infusions of 2 to 20 micrograms of PAF in 0.25% ovine serum albumin-saline produced pulmonary hypertension, hypoxia and dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and thromboxane synthesis. The effects of a 2 micrograms of PAF infusion were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those produced by a ZAP infusion. Pretreatment with aspirin (10 mg/kg) protected the sheep against the pulmonary vascular response to 20 micrograms of PAF and blocked completely the thromboxane synthesis. L-652,731 at a dose of 8 mg/kg blocked completely the neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thromboxane synthesis, pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia induced by 5 micrograms of PAF, but this protective effect was not observed in animals infused with ZAP. These results indicate that PAF is probably not a mediator of the neutropenia, thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia which result from the infusion of ZAP into sheep.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Characterization of dog fat cell adrenoceptors: variations in alpha-2 and beta adrenergic receptors distribution according to the extent of the fat deposits and the anatomical location.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In the search of the most accurate animal model for studies on fat cell adrenoceptor regulation, the characterization of dog fat cell beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptor properties was carried out using selected radioligands and biological measurements of fat cell function. Moreover, the distribution of dog fat cell adrenoceptors and the functional consequences were explored in fat deposits from different anatomical locations (perirenal, omental and s.c. adipose tissue). Beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors involved in the control of the lipolytic activity of dog fat cells exhibit pharmacological characteristics which are very similar to those defined in human adipocytes. However, in contrast with the results obtained in human adipocytes, there is a preponderance of beta over alpha-2 adrenergic binding sites, whatever the location of the fat deposits, in the dog. The higher values of the ratio beta-sites over alpha-2-sites were found in perirenal adipocytes whereas the lowest values of this ratio were found in s.c. deposits. A close positive relationship exist between alpha-2 adrenoceptor number, alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness and fat cell volume. To conclude, beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors exhibit similar pharmacological properties in dog and human fat cells. Variations according to the anatomical location of the fat deposits exist in both species. However, as opposed to human fat cells, it is evident that the balance between beta and alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness is predominantly under the control of beta adrenoceptors in dog fat cells.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diuretic effect induced by intrarenal infusion of pinacidil in anesthetized dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The diuretic action of pinacidil, a new vasodilating antihypertensive agent, was studied using anesthetized dogs. Intrarenally administered pinacidil (0.4, 2.0 and 10 micrograms/kg/min) produced a dose-related increase of renal blood flow, without altering mean arterial pressure. The glomerular filtration rate significantly increased only with the highest dosage. Pinacidil caused a dose-related augmentation of urine formation and, when given at 10 micrograms/kg/min, increased urine flow and urinary excretion of electrolytes to about 10 times and 3 to 9 times over the respective control value. In comparison, hydralazine (4.0 and 20 micrograms/kg/min) produced no significant diuretic action and bradykinin, given at a dose (0.02 micrograms/kg/min) equipotent to pinacidil (10 micrograms/kg/min) with respect to increasing renal blood flow, was less effective. Pinacidil administration significantly increased the fractional excretion of phosphate. Thus, pinacidil-induced diuresis seems to be due mainly to the vasodilating effect on renal vessels, with some contribution from an inhibitory effect on sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubules.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adenosine inhibits immunoglobulin E-dependent histamine secretion from human basophil leukocytes by two independent mechanisms.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Adenosine inhibits immunoglobulin E-dependent histamine release when preincubated with human basophil leukocytes before challenge. Two distinct mechanisms for this inhibition have been demonstrated. The first we suggest to be an A2-purinoceptor mediated mechanism. This effect, which is apparent with both 15- and 60-min preincubation periods, is mimicked by 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine, blocked by 8-phenyltheophylline but not dipyridamole and is associated with the ability of adenosine to elevate cyclic AMP. The second, which is mimicked by 3-deazaadenosine and is associated only with the longer 60-min preincubation period, is reversed by dipyridamole but not by 8-phenyltheophylline suggesting it to be an intracellular mechanism. Its enhancement by homocysteine thiolactone and reversal by exogenous S-adenosyl methionine suggests it to result from increasing intracellular S-adenosyl homocysteine levels. Our failure to detect increased 3H-methyl incorporation into chloroform-methanol extractable lipids after immunoglobulin E-dependent activation would indicate that inhibition of S-adenosyl methionine methylation reactions are an unlikely mechanism. As both prior stimulation of A2-purinoceptors and elevation of intracellular S-adenosyl homocysteine enhance and prolong the cyclic AMP response consequent upon immunoglobulin E-dependent activation, this represents a common mechanism by which histamine release may be suppressed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Contribution of substance P to heat-induced edema in rat paw.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To investigate a physiological function of substance P (SP) present in the peripheral ending of sensory neurons, we determined immunoreactive SP (iSP) levels in the s.c. perfusate and the amount of edema evoked in rat paw by noxious heat stimulation. We found that immersion of rat paw into hot water (47 degrees C) for 30 min led to a significant increase of iSP in the perfusate and about 50% increase in paw volume. Neonatal pretreatment with capsaicin inhibited significantly the increase in both iSP and paw volume evoked by noxious heat stimulation. Acute and chronic denervation of the sciatic and saphenous nerves also inhibited the heat-evoked iSP release and edema remarkably. Intraplantar injection of SP evoked an increase in paw volume in dose-dependent manner. This increasing effect of SP on paw volume was more substantial than that produced by histamine. Simultaneous treatment with stem bromelain and emorfazone decreased significantly the heat-evoked iSP release and edema. These results suggest that 1) SP produced by noxious heat stimulation in the periphery may be released from the afferent fibers with small-diameter, 2) bradykinin may intervene in this SP release and 3) SP released in the periphery may be closely related to the edema formation of the thermal injury reaction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pharmacological analysis of the cardiac actions of xamoterol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonistic activity, in guinea pig heart: evidence for involvement of adenylate cyclase system in its cardiac stimulant actions.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pharmacological effects of xamoterol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonistic activity, were examined in guinea pig cardiac preparations and compared with those of isoproterenol to assess possible mechanisms of its cardiac stimulant actions. Xamoterol produced a positive inotropic effect in the papillary muscles and a positive chronotropic effect in the spontaneously beating right atria in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum inotropic and chronotropic effects of xamoterol were about 33 and 35% of those of isoproterenol, respectively. Although xamoterol failed to produce a consistent increase in contractile force in the left atria, the positive inotropic effect of the agent was observed clearly in preparations obtained from reserpine-pretreated animals. The positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of xamoterol were antagonized by atenolol, but not by ICI 118,551. On the other hand, xamoterol antagonized competitively the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoproterenol. In papillary muscles the increases in contractile force induced by xamoterol and isoproterenol were depressed markedly in the presence of carbachol or adenosine. In all of left atria, right atria and papillary muscles obtained from reserpine-pretreated animals, xamoterol caused a significant elevation in cyclic AMP levels, while inhibiting the isoproterenol-induced increase in cyclic AMP levels. Computer-assisted analysis of concentration-response curves for the inhibition by xamoterol of the binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol in the membranes from guinea pig ventricles showed the existence of the 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate sensitive, highly affinity site of beta adrenoceptors for xamoterol, suggesting that xamoterol may induce the formation of a ternary complex with the beta adrenoceptor and a stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Impairment of the extraneuronal O-methylating system of isoproterenol by stop-flow ischemia in the perfused rat heart.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Effects of ischemia on the extraneuronal O-methylating system were investigated in the perfused rat heart. Ischemia was produced by stopping of the perfusion for 30 min. Isoproterenol (ISO) was used as a model substrate for the extraneuronal uptake of catecholamines. The accumulation of ISO when catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (EC 2.1.1.6) was inhibited by 3',4'-dihydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (U-0521) was decreased by ischemia to about 50% of the control value. Ischemia decreased the formation of 3-O-methyl-ISO, a major metabolite of ISO formed by COMT, to about 30% of that in the control hearts. The efflux of extraneuronally accumulated ISO in the heart with and without ischemia was measured. The diffusion constant calculated by the slope of the efflux rate of ISO or by the efflux rate divided by the amount of ISO remaining in the heart after ischemia was about 50% of the control. The experiments showed that ischemia suppressed the extraneuronal O-methylating system (extraneuronal uptake, COMT and diffusional flux) in the rat heart. Such suppression may lead to higher concentrations of local catecholamines in myocardial infarction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of (-)-desmethoxyverapamil on heart and vascular smooth muscle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- (-)-Desmethoxyverapamil [also known as (-)-devapamil or (-)-D888] has been developed as a verapamil type radioligand for the study of calcium channels. In the present investigation, the effects of (-)-desmethoxyverapamil on action potential (AP) and force of contraction in heart muscle preparations and on tension and 45Ca influx in vascular smooth muscle are described. In part, the effects were compared with the (+)-isomer of desmethoxyverapamil and the isomers of both verapamil and methoxyverapamil. In atrial and/or ventricular heart muscle preparations from guinea pigs, cats and man, (-)-desmethoxyverapamil decreased the force of contraction and shortened the AP duration. Slow response APs were depressed, whereas dV/dtmax of phase 0 of the AP remained unchanged. The rank order of potency of the (-)-isomers was as follows: desmethoxyverapamil greater than methoxyverapamil greater than verapamil. Potassium-induced contractures and 45Ca influx were depressed by the (-)-isomers of desmethoxyverapamil, methoxyverapamil and verapamil in the same potency rank order as observed in heart muscle. The (+)-isomers exerted qualitatively similar effects at about 10 to 200 times higher concentrations. Correspondingly, the increase in potency of the racemic mixtures of the drugs was accompanied by increases in stereoselectivity. It is concluded that (-)-desmethoxyverapamil is the most potent stereoselective calcium antagonist of the verapamil type with respect to its effects on heart and vascular smooth muscle.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of chronic ethanol treatment on membrane potential, its electrogenic pump component and Na-K pump activity of cultured rat skeletal myotubes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Effects of chronic ethanol treatment were examined on transmembrane resting potential (Em), electrogenic pump component of Em and on Na-K pump activity of cultured rat skeletal myotubes. Properties of Na-K pump activity were determined by measurement of [3H]ouabain binding and 86Rb uptake by myotubes after incubation of myotubes in ethanol (217 mM) for up to 9 days. Chronic ethanol exposure caused an increase in Em, an increase in electrogenic pump component of Em and a decrease in depolarizing response to addition of ethanol to the myotubes. Chronic ethanol also produced increases in Na-K pump sites and in Na-K pump activity. Thus, chronic ethanol treatment causes a compensatory increase in amount and activity of the Na-K pump, and this results in an increased expression of the electrogenic pump component of Em. These effects may represent the membrane expression of tolerance to the depressant effects of ethanol.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibition of ischemia-induced subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes in the perfused rat heart by the calcium entry blocker, diltiazem.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Effect of diltiazem on subcellular distribution of lysosomal enzymes, high-energy phosphate metabolism and mechanical function in the ischemic heart was studied. Ischemia was induced by lowering the afterload pressure of the perfused working rat heart. The activities of cathepsin D, beta,N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase were determined in the nonsedimentable and sedimentable fractions after centrifugation of the tissue extract to assess the subcellular distribution of lysosomal enzymes. After ischemia, decreases in the mechanical function and the tissue level of high-energy phosphates were observed. In addition, ischemia caused subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes from the lysosomes to the cytoplasm. Reperfusion of the ischemic heart did not restore the mechanical function and the level of high-energy phosphates completely. Diltiazem (2.21 X 10(-6), 1.11 X 10(-5) and 2.21 X 10(-5) M) was provided for the heart 5 min before the onset of ischemia. Diltiazem preserved high-energy phosphates in the ischemic heart, and inhibited the subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes being caused by ischemia, depending on its concentration. Reperfusion after ischemia with diltiazem recovered the mechanical function that had been decreased by ischemia. These results may indicate that diltiazem can protect the myocardium against ischemic damage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of lidocaine on the myocardial acidosis induced by coronary artery occlusion in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of lidocaine on ischemic myocardial acidosis was investigated in the dog heart, in which the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded to reduce to about one-third (partial occlusion). Myocardial pH (MpH) was measured by means of a micro glass pH electrode. MpH before partial occlusion was 7.52 to 7.66. Partial occlusion decreased the left anterior descending coronary artery flow by 49 to 68%, MpH by 0.58 to 0.76 and myocardial contractile force by 26 to 43%, and increased ST segment (surface electrocardiogram) by 3.2 to 11.7 mV. Lidocaine (injected i.v. 30 min after partial occlusion) decreased heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial contractile force, and attenuated the decrease in MpH during ischemia. Lidocaine in doses of 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg restored the myocardial [H+], that had been increased by partial occlusion, by 23, 38 and 50%, respectively. Even in the paced heart, lidocaine (10 mg/kg) attenuated the myocardial acidosis, although the degree of attenuation was smaller (36%). Partial occlusion elevated the ST segment even in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/kg of lidocaine. In the nonischemic heart, however, lidocaine (2, 5 or 10 mg/kg) did not change in MpH. It is concluded that lidocaine attenuates the myocardial acidosis during ischemia, and the primarily important mechanism of pH attenuation is not a decrease in heart rate.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Beta-2 adrenoceptor control of the venous circulation in intact dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation on the peripheral circulation in 10 dogs were evaluated. All studies were done during ganglion blockade with hexamethonium. Venous capacitance was assessed by measuring mean circulatory filling pressure, venous compliance and unstressed vascular volume. Beta-2 stimulation was achieved with terbutaline (27 micrograms/min) after beta-1 blockade with metoprolol (0.75 mg/kg). At a dose of terbutaline that decreased mean aortic pressure from 80.4 +/- 3.5 to 58.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (P less than .01), there was no change in cardiac index (155.8 +/- 10.5 vs. 161.1 +/- 9.1 ml/kg/min) despite an increase in heart rate from 118.6 +/- 5.2 to 132.6 +/- 5.0 beats/min. Right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and dP/dt did not change. Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 0.52 +/- 0.02 to 0.39 +/- 0.03 mm Hg . min . kg . ml (P less than .01). Arterial compliance increased from 0.067 +/- 0.003 to 0.088 +/- 0.007 ml/mm Hg/kg and the volume of blood shifted out of the larger arteries was 1.8 +/- 0.4 ml/kg. Mean circulatory filling pressure did not change but venous compliance decreased from 1.90 +/- 0.04 to 1.47 +/- 0.06 ml/mm Hg/kg and unstressed vascular volume increased from -14.5 +/- 0.5 to -8.4 +/- 0.5 ml/kg. Central blood volume increased from 22.8 +/- 1.1 to 27.4 +/- 2.2 ml/kg. There was an increase in total blood volume from 81.1 +/- 2.7 to 90.5 +/- 3.7 ml/kg. To determine the extent to which changes in the spleen were responsible for these observations, five dogs were studied 2 weeks after splenectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of serotonin1 and serotonin2 receptor agonists and antagonists on blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous studies indicate that serotonin (5-HT) neurons provide a tonic excitatory input to central sympathetic neurons. The purpose of the present study was to utilize a number of 5-HT agonists in order to provide insights into the general function of the serotonergic system in the regulation of central sympathetic pathways. The 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and p-aminophenyl-ethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine produced a dose-related inhibition of sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) recorded from either the postganglionic inferior cardiac nerve or the preganglionic splanchnic nerve in chloralose-anesthetized cats. The sympatholytic effects of 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and p-aminophenyl-ethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine were accompanied by hypotension and bradycardia. The effects of 5-HT1A agonists were reversed by the 5-HT1A antagonist spiperone. In contrast, spiperone alone produced decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and SND. The 5-HT1B agonists 1[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-piperazine, 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine and 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine all produced variable effects on SND. In some experiments, SND was increased by these agents, whereas it was decreased in others. The 5-HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane produced a marked increase in SND. A second 5-HT2 agonist, MK212, produced similar effects. The role of 5-HT receptor subtypes in mediating the 5-HT excitation of sympathetic neurons is discussed. It is suggested that 5-HT1A agonists inhibit SND through a process of disfacilitation by inhibiting the firing rate of 5-HT neurons. Possible mechanisms by which 5-HT2 agonists increase SND are proposed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Norepinephrine regulation of alpha-1 receptors and alpha-1-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in primary neuronal cultures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Alpha-1 receptor density and alpha-1 receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in neuronal primary cultures are regulated by exposure of the cells to the alpha-1 agonist norepinephrine (NE). Pretreatment of neuronal cultures with 10 microM NE caused a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in NE-stimulated accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates. The maximal NE-stimulated inositide hydrolysis was decreased by approximately 80% after 2 hr of pretreatment with NE, and this loss of responsiveness was reversible over a period of 12 hr. NE pretreatment of neuronal cultures did not affect the muscarinic receptor stimulation of inositide hydrolysis. Neither the number of alpha-1 receptor recognition sites, assessed by measuring the specific binding of DL-[125I]-alpha-(3-iodohydroxyphenyl)-ethyl-aminomethyl tetralone ([125I]HEAT), nor the Ki for NE inhibition of [125I]HEAT binding were changed appreciably after treating neurons with NE for 2 hr. A time- and concentration-dependent decrease in alpha-1 receptor recognition sites occurred with longer periods of NE pretreatment. The maximal loss of 50 to 60% [125I]HEAT binding sites was seen after 14 hr of pretreatment with NE. The number of [125I]HEAT binding sites returned to control levels within 24 hr in parallel with the recovery of alpha-1-stimulated inositide hydrolysis after being down-regulated by a 24-hr exposure to NE. Cycloheximide (3.5 microM) blocked both the recovery of alpha-1 receptors and the recovery of alpha-1-stimulated inositide hydrolysis after 24 hr of NE pretreatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Analysis of putative alpha-1s adrenoceptor agonism by Sgd 101/75 in the rat anococcygeus muscle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sgd 101/75 [2-(2-methylindazol-4-imino)-imidazolidine hydrochloride] is an alpha 1 adrenoceptor agonist that shows a greater sensitivity to receptor alkylation with phenoxybenzamine (POB) than norepinephrine (NE) (present study). J. Coates, D.G. Weetman and their co-workers have concluded that Sgd 101/75 is selective for a subtype of alpha-1 receptors, i.e., alpha-1s. The present studies have shown that Sgd 101/75 was a full agonist in the rat anococcygeus muscle and acts at alpha-1 adrenoceptors, as determined by Schild analysis of prazosin antagonism (pKB = 9.24 +/- 0.21, slope = 0.87 +/- 0.13). Alkylation experiments showed that the contractile effects of Sgd 101/75 were more sensitive to POB than the effects of NE. These experiments also allowed the determination of KA values for these agonists (Sgd 101/75 KA = 1.5 +/- 0.6 X 10(-5) M, NE KA = 2.6 +/- 1.0 X 10(-6) M). At 3 X 10(-8) M POB (10 min), the contractile effect of Sgd 101/75 was eliminated, whereas the concentration-effect curve for NE was shifted approximately one log unit to the right with a 20% decrease in maximal response. After similar POB treatment, incubation with Sgd 101/75 (60 min, 3 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-4) M) shifted the NE curve to the right in a concentration-dependent manner. Schild regression of these data yielded a pKB = 5.22 +/- 0.09 and slope = 0.87 +/- 0.08. This pKB (-log KB) showed that Sgd 101/75 was competing for the same receptor after POB treatment and before POB treatment (mean of -log KA = 4.92 +/- 0.12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reinforcing and subjective effects of several anorectics in normal human volunteers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A discrete-trial choice procedure was used to examine the reinforcing and subjective effects of four anorectic drugs (mazindol, benzphetamine, phenylpropanolamine and phenmetrazine) in groups of normal healthy adults. For each experiment, subjects first sampled placebo and a dose of one of the drugs (mazindol: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg; benzphetamine: 25 and 50 mg; phenylpropanolamine: 12.5, 25 and 50 mg; phenmetrazine: 25 and 50 mg; all p.o.). Subjects were then allowed to choose between drug and placebo on five separate occasions. The relative frequency with which active drug was chosen over placebo was used as an index of the drug's reinforcing efficacy. Subjective effects were measured with an experimental version of the Profile of Mood States, a short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory and a series of visual analog scales. The rank order for reinforcing efficacy was benzphetamine approximately phenmetrazine greater than placebo greater than phenylpropanolamine much greater than mazindol. Ratings of drug liking were positively correlated with number of drug choices for each drug. Benzphetamine and phenmetrazine produced subjective effects characteristic of amphetamine-like drugs and increased ratings of drug liking. Mazindol produced only dysphoric subjective effects and decreased ratings of drug liking. Phenylpropanolamine had no significant effects on subjective measures or drug-liking ratings. These findings are consistent with the presumed dependence potential of these compounds, and demonstrate the validity of this experimental paradigm for assessing the reinforcing effects of anorectics in normal human volunteers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pharmacological characterization of CGS 15943A: a novel nonxanthine adenosine antagonist.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- CGS 15943A is a potent adenosine receptor antagonist with a novel nonxanthine heterocyclic ring structure. In vitro, CGS 15943A competitively inhibited the 2-chloroadenosine-induced A2 receptor-mediated relaxation of dog coronary artery strips contracted with KCl (25 mM). Similarly, CGS 15943A blocked 2-chloroadenosine- and N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine-induced A2 receptor-mediated relaxation of histamine-contracted guinea pig tracheal strips. Schild analysis of these results yielded pA2 values of 10.8 and 10.1 for the coronary arteries and the tracheal smooth muscle strips, respectively. In comparison, 8-phenyltheophylline blocked 2-chloroadenosine-induced tracheal response with a pA2 value of 7.0. CGS 15943A was devoid of intrinsic activity, and did not affect either histamine- or KCl-induced contractions of the smooth muscle strips. In the electrically stimulated guinea pig left atrial preparation, CGS 15943A antagonized the A1 receptor-mediated negative inotropic effects of R-phenylisopropyladenosine with a pA2 value of 7.4. In vivo, i.v. administration of CGS 15943A blocked the vasodepressor response to 2-chloradenosine in anesthetized normotensive rats with an ID50 of 0.024 mg/kg. In addition, p.o. administration of CGS 15943A (4.0 mg/kg) to conscious rats inhibited 2-chloroadenosine-induced decreases in diastolic blood pressure; maximal effects were observed 30 min after dosing, with a T1/2 of approximately 103 min. Therefore suggesting that CGS 15943A is an orally active antagonist of adenosine receptors. These results indicate that CGS 15943A antagonized both A1 and A2 receptor-mediated responses with a greater affinity toward the A2 than the A1 receptor subtype.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adenosine mediates the negative chronotropic action of adenosine 5'-triphosphate in the canine sinus node.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- ATP exerts pronounced electrophysiologic effects in the mammalian heart. The present study tested the hypothesis that the negative chronotropic action of ATP in the canine sinus node is dependent on its degradation to adenosine. Increasing doses of the following compounds were administered in the sinus nodal artery of 12 open chest dogs (either sex, 30-35 kg) anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg i.v.): adenosine, ATP, alpha,beta methylene-ATP (AMPCPP) and beta,gamma methylene-ATP (AMPPCP). Right atrial, His bundle and right ventricular electrograms as well as Lead II ECG and systemic arterial blood pressure were monitored continuously and recorded. The depressant effects of test compounds on the sinus node were assessed from the prolongation of sinus cycle length and the duration of junctional escape rhythm which they induced. Data were used to plot dose-response curves for the four test compounds. The order of potency was adenosine greater than or equal to ATP greater than or equal to AMPPCP much greater than AMPCPP = 0. In 3 of 12 dogs the emergence of junctional escape rhythm was observed after the highest dose of either adenosine, ATP or AMPPCP. In addition, aminophylline, a selective competitive inhibitor of adenosine at P1-purinoceptor site, reduced the effects of maximal doses of adenosine, ATP and AMPPCP by 52 +/- 7, 67 +/- 8 and 72 +/- 6%, respectively (each, P less than .05; AMPPCP vs. adenosine, P less than .05). The present data indicate that the negative chronotropic action of ATP is due to its rapid catabolism to adenosine and the action of adenosine at P1-purinoceptor sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diltiazem and autoregulation of canine cerebral blood flow.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Recent in vitro evidence suggests the existence of stretch-activated calcium channels in cerebrovascular smooth muscle. These channels, which may play a role in cerebral autoregulation, also appear resistant to antagonism by the benzothiazepine calcium antagonist diltiazem, an agent known to block potential-sensitive and receptor-operated calcium channels. If cerebral autoregulation involves stretch-sensitive diltiazem-resistant calcium channels, then autoregulation should remain intact during vasodilatation produced by diltiazem. The present study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Using a canine cerebral venous outflow preparation, experiments were first performed to determine the optimum dose and route of administration for diltiazem. Although continuous i.v. diltiazem (1-100 micrograms/kg/min) did not increase cerebral perfusion at any normotensive dose, i.a. (lingual artery) diltiazem at 10.0 micrograms/kg/min increased cerebral blood flow by 36% and decreased cerebrovascular resistance by 31% without significant effects on blood gas levels, cerebral oxygen uptake, cardiac output or mean arterial pressure. In autoregulation experiments, 10.0 micrograms/kg/min of diltiazem significantly attenuated but did not eliminate autoregulatory responses to increases (inflation of an aortic balloon) and decreases (hemorrhage) in cerebral perfusion pressure. Autoregulatory responses to increases and decreases in perfusion pressure were equally affected by diltiazem, but both were unaffected by i.a. saline. These data support the view that cerebral autoregulation involves both diltiazem-sensitive and diltiazem-resistant mechanisms. The diltiazem-resistant mechanisms, which may include the proposed population of stretch-sensitive calcium channels appear to account for up to one-half of the autoregulatory capacity in the cerebral circulation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cytotoxicity of oxidative metabolites of procainamide.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Indirect evidence suggests that metabolism of procainamide (PA) may be necessary for generation of its autoimmunity-inducing capacity. Reactive metabolites of PA produced by hepatic mixed function oxidases have been identified by their capacity to bind proteins covalently. The present study extends these findings by comparing the toxicity of various chemically synthesized metabolites of PA to a variety of cell lines and primary cultures. PA and its N-acetyl- and N-acetyl-N-oxide-derivatives were nontoxic to S49.1 cells at concentrations up to 5 mM, whereas nitro-Pa (4-nitro-N-(diethylaminoethyl)benzamide hydrochloride) and azoxy-PA (bis-N,N'-(diethylaminoethyl)-4,4'-azoxydibenzamide) displayed partial cytotoxicity at 1 and 0.1 mM, respectively. (The therapeutic range of PA is 0.02-0.05 mM.). In contrast, hydroxylamine-PA (4-hydroxylamino-N-(diethylaminoethyl)benzamide hydrochloride) was highly cytotoxic, producing a TD50 between 0.002 and 0.045 mM among the eight cell lines tested. Hydroxylamine-PA sensitivity correlated with cell reducing capacity, suggesting that redox cycling contributes to cytotoxicity. The hydroxylamine metabolite of PA undergoes spontaneous air oxidation to the nitroso-derivative (nitroso-PA). When this oxidation was minimized by rapid manipulations or inhibited by ascorbic acid, cytotoxicity was reduced or eliminated, suggesting that the nitroso-derivative may be the toxic metabolite. Quiescent peripheral blood lymphocytes, especially T-cells, were relatively insensitive to hydroxylamine-PA when evaluated by dye exclusion 1 day after drug exposure. However, massive DNA strand breaks were detectable in these cells immediately after drug exposure, and resting lymphocytes treated with 0.01 mM hydroxylamine-PA died slowly during the subsequent week.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density and functional responsiveness in rat brain.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of changes in norepinephrine availability on alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness were determined in several regions of rat brain. Receptor density was determined from specific 125I-BE 2254 binding, and responsiveness was determined by norepinephrine-stimulated increases in inositol phosphate accumulation and in cyclic AMP accumulation in the absence or presence of adenosine in slices where beta adrenergic receptors had been inactivated. Adrenergic input was reduced by destroying noradrenergic neurons with DSP-4, depleting amines with chronic reserpine treatment or blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors with chronic prazosin treatment. All three treatments caused similar increases in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density in cerebral cortex but not in striatum or hippocampus. DSP-4 treatment increased the maximal cyclic AMP response to both norepinephrine and phenylephrine but did not alter the maximal inositol phosphate response or the maximal potentiation of the cyclic AMP response to adenosine. DSP-4 treatment also increased the potency of norepinephrine in activating all three responses in cerebral cortex. Adrenergic input was increased by chronic treatment with desmethylimipramine to block norepinephrine reuptake, chronic i.c.v. infusion of norepinephrine or chronic yohimbine treatment to block presynaptic autoreceptors. None of these treatments caused significant changes in alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density or functional responsiveness in any region studied. The results suggest that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness in rat brain can be increased but not easily decreased. They also suggest that different brain regions are affected differently by alterations of adrenergic input and that the different responses are not coregulated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- In vitro vascular relaxation by new inotropic agents: relationship to phosphodiesterase inhibition and cyclic nucleotides.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Several novel cardiotonic vasodilators including bipyridines (amrinone and milrinone), imidazolones (enoximone and piroximone), dihydropyridazinones (Cl-914, Cl-930 and LY195115) and an imidazopyridine (isomazole) relaxed rat aortic strips contracted previously with 30 microM serotonin. LY195115 and Cl-930 were the most potent vasorelaxant agonists (ED50 approximately 10(-7) M), whereas piroximone and amrinone were the least potent (ED50 approximately 10(-5) M). In addition to these positive inotropic agents, vascular relaxation was examined further for a series of novel dihydropyridazinones, and relaxant potencies correlated directly with the ability of these agents to inhibit an isozyme of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac muscle (SR-PDE) (r = 0.87, P less than .01). This excellent correlation suggests that vascular relaxation produced by these agents is related to their ability to inhibit a vascular enzyme similar or identical to SR-PDE. Furthermore, LY195115, milrinone and isomazole (10(-4) M) produced significant increases in both aortic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Time courses for these changes were consistent with a role for cyclic nucleotides in relaxation; however, differences between the relative increases in cAMP or cGMP produced by these drugs were evident. Removal of the aortic endothelium had no effect upon relaxation produced by milrione and only a modest (approximately 2-fold decrease in potency) effect on relaxation produced by LY195115 and isomazole, indicating that the relaxant effect of these cardiotonics is primarily an endothelium-independent event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Characterization of the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor in rat submandibular gland: radioligand binding assay in membrane preparations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor in membranes from rat submandibular gland was studied using radioligand binding assays with 125I-VIP and various unlabeled competing ligands. In addition to the necessity of working within the parameters under which all radioligand binding assays should be performed, binding studies with 125I-VIP, as with other peptide hormones and neurotransmitters, are subject to additional technical difficulties. Specific problems that were addressed included radioligand proteolysis, the identification of an effective protease inhibitor (leupeptin) and the deleterious effects of a commonly used inhibitor (bacitracin); avid radioligand absorption to incubation tubes that was eliminated by precoating of the tubes with a combination of polyethylenimine and an organosilane; and a disproportionate effect of increasing membrane protein concentration on affinity estimates. Under optimized conditions, the affinity (Kd) and density Bmax values for 125I-VIP obtained from saturation assays (76 pM, 2.0 pmol/mg) were in excellent agreement. Membrane protein (or receptor) levels beyond the linear portion of the receptor concentration curve are often used in radioligand binding assays. Results from 125I-VIP binding studies at elevated receptor concentrations revealed the predicted marked decrease in receptor affinity. In addition, the rank order potency of unlabeled ligands in inhibition binding assays was changed. The optimization of the assay for measuring VIP receptors in submandibular gland membrane provides a reliable method for studying the role of receptor regulation in stimulus-secretion coupling for this neuropeptide.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A1- and A2-selective adenosine antagonists: in vivo characterization of cardiovascular effects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Caffeine, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, 7-methyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, a purported A2 selective antagonist and a 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine amine congener (XAC), an A1 selective antagonist, were evaluated for their in vivo selectivity at A1 vs. A2 adenosine receptors. Blockade of the negative chronotropic effect of bolus i.v. injections of 2-chloroadenosine, R-phenylisopropyladenosine and N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine was utilized as an index of antagonism at A1 receptors; blockade of the hypotensive effect of the same series of adenosine agonists was used as an index of activity at A2 receptors. In addition, blockade of the potentiating effect of adenosine on the hypertensive and chronotropic effects of nicotine was studied to assess further the role of A1 and A2 adenosine receptors in this response. The potent antagonist XAC displayed considerable A1 selectivity as demonstrated by blockade of adenosine receptor-mediated bradycardia at doses 5- to 10-fold lower than those antagonizing adenosine receptor-mediated hypotension. XAC also selectively blocked potentiation by adenosine of the positive chronotropic effect of nicotine, at doses which had minimal effects on the enhancement of the hypertensive effect of nicotine. The caffeine homolog 7-methyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine exhibited A2 selectivity as demonstrated by prevention of adenosine receptor-mediated hypotension at doses which only minimally attenuated the bradycardiac effect of adenosine analogs. Caffeine displayed no selectivity for A1 vs. A2 adenosine receptors. The results indicate that selective analogs such as XAC and F-methyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine will be useful probes for investigation of receptors involved in the physiological functions of adenosine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- In rat hippocampus, somatostatin 14 and muscarinic receptor ligands modulate an adenylate cyclase belonging to a common domain of the receptor.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In hippocampal slices, somatostatin 14 and its stable analog L363 [cyclo(Phe-Pro-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr)] fail to modify muscarinic signal transduction mediated by stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown, whereas somatostatin 14 mimics oxotremorine in inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity of hippocampal membranes. The simultaneous addition of somatostatin 14 and oxotremorine elicits a nonadditive convergent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Both L363 and oxotremorine nonadditively stimulate a high-affinity guanosine 5'-triphosphatase activity of hippocampal membranes. This stimulation could be operative in mediating the convergent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity elicited by the binding of specific ligands to somatostatin and muscarinic recognition sites present in hippocampal membranes. Because L363 competitively displaces muscarinic agonists fand antagonists from their specific recognition sites, one might infer that the two recognition sites interact functionally; that is, somatostatin reduces the efficacy of oxotremorine and/or vice versa.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Identification of A1 and A2 adenosine receptors in the rat spinal cord.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The adenosine receptors in membranes prepared from rat ventral and dorsal lumbar spinal cord were characterized by comparing the binding characteristics of [3H]5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine ([3H]NECA), an agonist with nearly equal affinities at the A1 and A2 adenosine receptor subtypes, with those of [3H]N6-[(R)-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]adenosine ([3H]R-PIA), an A1-selective agonist. Saturation isotherms of the ventral and dorsal spinal cord yielded Kd values 1.9 to 2.3 nM for [3H]R-PIA and 18.1 to 19.5 nM for [3H]NECA. The Bmax for [3H]NeCA was approximately twice the Bmax for [3H]R-PIA in ventral and dorsal halves (267 vs. 128 fmol/mg of protein and 402 vs. 206 fmol/mg of protein, respectively). Displacement of specific [3H]NECA binding by the A2-selective agonist, 2-(phenylamino)adenosine, the relatively nonselective antagonist, theophylline and six A1-selective agonists, R-PIA, S-PIA, N6-(cyclohexyl)adenosine, N6-(cyclopentyl)adenosine, N6-(m-aminophenyl)adenosine and N6-(m-iodophenyl)adenosine, revealed two [3H]NECA binding components with the characteristics of A1 and A2 receptors. All curves best fit a two-site model when analyzed by the computer program LIGAND. R-PIA, N6-(cyclohexyl)adenosine and N6-(cyclopentyl)adenosine were the most potent displacers at the first site (Ki = 0.6-1.4 nM). All A1-selective agonists were poor displacers of [3H]NECA at the second site (Ki = 0.6-18.6 microM). The A2-selective agonist, 2-(phenylamino)adenosine, was as potent as R-PIA in displacing [3H]NECA from this site with a Ki value 0.57 microM. Finally, the A1 and A2 adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition and stimulation of adenylate cyclase were demonstrated directly in synaptic membranes prepared from the spinal cord.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine destroy serotonin terminals in rat brain: quantification of neurodegeneration by measurement of [3H]paroxetine-labeled serotonin uptake sites.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study examines the effects of repeated systemic administration (20 mg/kg s.c., twice daily for 4 days) of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) on levels of brain monoamines, their metabolites and on the density of monoamine uptake sites in various regions of rat brain. Marked reductions (30-60%) in the concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were observed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and midbrain at 2 weeks after a 4-day treatment regimen of MDMA or MDA; less consistent reductions in serotonin (5-HT) content were observed in these brain regions. In addition, both MDMA and MDA caused comparable and substantial reductions (50-75%) in the density of [3H]paroxetine-labeled 5-HT uptake sites in all brain regions examined. In contrast, neither MDMA nor MDA caused any widespread or long-term changes in the content of the catecholaminergic markers (i.e., norepinephrine, dopamine, 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid) or in the number of [3H]mazindol-labeled norepinephrine or dopamine uptake sites in the brain regions examined. These data demonstrate that MDMA and MDA cause long-lasting neurotoxic effects with respect to both the functional and structural integrity of serotonergic neurons in brain. Furthermore, our measurement of reductions in the density of 5-HT uptake sites provides a means for quantification of the neurodegenerative effects of MDMA and MDA on presynaptic 5-HT terminals.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Individual differences in responsiveness to single and repeated amphetamine administration: behavioral characteristics and neurochemical correlates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The administration of amphetamine to rats results in a relatively wide range of individual differences in responsiveness, both in the initial behavioral patterns as well as in the augmentation response to repeated administration. Therefore we examined the possibility that such differences might reflect intrinsic variation in neurochemical mechanisms regulating responsiveness to amphetamine. Animals were administered a transitional dose (1.75 mg/kg) of amphetamine with regard to the induction of locomotion and continuous stereotypy. On the basis of individual response profiles animals could be separated into two markedly different subgroups, one displaying continuous locomotion (S1), characteristic of lower amphetamine doses, and the other exhibiting a multiphasic pattern, including a prolonged focused stereotypy phase (S2), typically associated with higher amphetamine doses. Examination of regional brain monoamine and metabolite levels revealed distinguishing patterns between the subgroups only in the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems. With repeated amphetamine administration, the two prominent factors of the augmentation, the emergence of stereotypy and the enhancement of locomotion during the last half of the response, were dissociable between the subgroups. The emergence of stereotypy was confined to S1 animals, whereas only the S2 subgroup displayed the progressive increase in locomotion. Differences in the responsiveness of neurochemical systems to amphetamine rather than pharmacokinetic factors appear to underly the distinct behavioral profiles associated with the two subgroups. The results indicate that characterization of individual responses may be required to determine accurately the neurochemical mechanisms involved in the behavioral effects of amphetamine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mechanisms mediating the positive inotropic and chronotropic changes induced by dopexamine in the anesthetized dog.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Mechanisms contributing to the increments in heart rate (HR) and cardiac contractile force (CCF) produced by dopexamine (DPX) were studied in anesthetized dogs. Intravenous infusions of DPX (4.0 micrograms/kg/min) produced increments in HR, CCF and renal blood flow and decrements in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The sequential administration of atenolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) administered at a dose selective for beta-1 adrenoceptors, propranolol (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) and the DA1 dopamine receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) blocked the DPX-induced changes in HR, CCF, MAP and renal blood flow, respectively. After ganglionic blockade, the increments in HR and CCF produced by DPX (4.0 and 16.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) were reduced 90 and 76%, respectively, with little or no change in its hypotensive effect. In separate dogs, administration of the beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (0.55 microgram/kg i.v.) produced a comparable decrement in MAP but smaller increments in HR and CCF than produced by DPX (16.0 micrograms/kg i.v.). DPX (64 micrograms/kg i.v.) also produced greater increments in HR during cardioaccelerator nerve stimulation (1 Hz, 0.5 msec, supramaximal voltage) than before nerve stimulation. Therefore, we tested the effect of DPX (1.0, 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) on the increments in HR, CCF and MAP produced by norepinephrine (0.25 microgram/kg i.v.) and the indirect acting sympathomimetic amine, tyramine (60 micrograms/kg i.v.). DPX potentiated the increments in HR, CCF and MAP produced by norepinephrine and suppressed those produced by tyramine. Thus, the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of DPX in the intact dog are due primarily to baroreceptor-mediated stimulation and inhibition of neuronal uptake of norepinephrine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Characterization of D-2 dopamine receptors in a tumor of the rat anterior pituitary gland.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Dopamine receptors in the 7315a transplantable rat anterior pituitary tumor were characterized using radioligand binding assays with [3H]spiroperidol ([3H]SPD) and assays of adenylate cyclase activity. Scatchard analysis of the binding of [3H]SPD yielded linear plots and a Kd value of 73 pM. Studies of the inhibition of the binding of [3H]SPD were performed with a series of competing ligands, including the antagonists domperidone, (+)-butaclamol and sulpiride and the agonists dopamine, bromocriptine and N-propylnorapomorphine. Inhibition curves for the antagonists gave Hill coefficients of approximately 1, consistent with the presence of only a single class of binding sites with a high affinity for [3H]SPD. In contrast, the Hill coefficient for dopamine was significantly less than 1. When assays were carried out in the presence of 300 microM GTP, the inhibition curve for dopamine was shifted to the right and the Hill coefficient increased to approximately 1. An effect of GTP on the affinity of a receptor for agonists is consistent with the existence of at least two agonist affinity states. Inhibition of the binding of [3H]SPD by the partial agonist bromocriptine was not affected when assays were carried out in the presence of GTP. The uniform low affinity of the selective serotonin antagonist ketanserin for these sites indicated that the radioligand was not labeling serotonin-2 receptors in this tissue. A good correlation was observed between the Ki values for competing ligands measured in the tumor and in homogenates of rat striatal tissue. Dopamine was shown to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Binding, degradation and pressor activity of angiotensins II and III after aminopeptidase inhibition with amastatin and bestatin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In the metabolism of angiotensin peptides by tissue angiotensinases, aminopeptidases A, B, M and leucine aminopeptidase have been identified as being particularly effective. Because the inhibitory actions of amastatin (AM) and bestatin (BE) are relatively specific for these aminopeptidases, we have examined the effects of these inhibitors on the binding, degradation and pressor activity of angiotensin II (AII) and angiotensin III (AIII). Within 30 min at 37 degrees C, significant metabolism of 125I-AII and 125I-AIII by homogenates of a block of tissue containing hypothalamus, thalamus, septum and anteroventral third ventricle regions of the brain was observed. A majority of 125I-AIII metabolism was due to soluble peptidases, whereas that of 125I-AII primarily resulted from membrane-bound peptidases. AM, BE and reduced incubation temperatures significantly decreased the metabolism of 125I-AII and 125I-AIII. After appropriate adjustments to reflect the proportion of intact radioligand bound, temperature- or inhibitor-induced decreases in metabolism were matched by corresponding increases in specific binding. Heat-treated bovine serum albumin, as a nonspecific peptidase inhibitor, had no effect on either the metabolism or binding of the ligands used. In accordance with their actions in vitro, i.c.v. administration of AM and BE prolonged the pressor activity of subsequently applied AII and AIII. Unexpectedly, the amplitude of the pressor response to AIII was increased by BE, whereas that to AII was decreased by AM. The results of this study indicate that the metabolism of AII and AIII by aminopeptidases is relatively specific and acts to modulate the actions of these peptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Neurochemical actions of anesthetic drugs on the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-chloride channel complex.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Interaction of intoxicant-anesthetic drugs with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-chloride channel complex of mouse brain was studied using the binding of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to isolated membranes and the GABA-stimulated uptake of 36Cl- by membrane vesicles. Anesthetic drugs, including barbiturates, chloroform, diethylether and ethanol, inhibited the binding of TBPS and enhanced the GABA-dependent influx of chloride. In the presence of bicuculline, barbiturates increased the binding of TBPS, but this action was not shared by other anesthetic agents. Inhibition of TBPS binding was found with drug concentrations that produce anesthesia in vivo, whereas augmentation of GABA action occurred at subanesthetic concentrations. Effects of a series of n-alcohols (methanol to decanol) were studied on TBPS binding and membrane fluidity (using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as a fluorescent probe). The potencies of the alcohols for inhibiting TBPS binding and fluidizing synaptic membranes were similar to their anesthetic potencies, but there were differences in the relative potencies of the drugs for inhibition of TBPS binding and membrane fluidization. These results, together with effects of assay temperature, suggest that effects of anesthetics on the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex were not due to changes in bulk membrane fluidity. Correlation of anesthetic potencies of chemically diverse agents with both inhibition of TBPS binding and augmentation of GABA-dependent chloride flux suggests a role for the GABA complex in anesthesia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Thermodynamic analyses of pirenzepine binding to membrane-bound and solubilized muscarinic receptors from rat forebrain and heart.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The thermodynamic properties of pirenzepine (PZ) binding to membrane-bound and digitonin-solubilized muscarinic receptors (mAChR) from the rat forebrain and heart were evaluated. Apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of PZ were measured from saturation studies using [3H]PZ for forebrain membrane-bound mAChR and from inhibition studies of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding using unlabeled PZ, at five different temperatures from 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C. The Kd values of PZ binding to both membrane-bound and solubilized mAChR decreased with decreasing temperature whereas the maximum receptor density was unchanged. The heterogeneity of membrane-bound mAChR characterized by PZ binding to mAChR from both tissues disappeared upon digitonin-solubilization of the mAChR. The magnitude of changes of the Kd values with temperature was greater in the solubilized mAChR, suggesting that some constituents in the membrane constrained the affinity changes. The Gibbs free energy of PZ binding to membrane-bound and solubilized mAChR were both negative. The Gibbs free energy for membrane-bound receptors decreased (more negative) whereas those for solubilized receptors increased (less negative) with increasing temperature. The change in entropy was the apparent major driving force for PZ binding to membrane-bound receptors with the change in enthalpy also being favorable. The change in enthalpy was the apparent major driving force for PZ binding to solubilized receptors at all temperatures with the change in entropy being unfavorable above 17 degrees C in the rat forebrain mAChR and above 10 degrees C in the heart mAChR. Our results suggest an important role for the biomembrane microenvironment and possible topographical differences in the binding sites which may contribute to the mechanism of muscarinic subtypes.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- From February 1983 to January 1985, we performed outpatient microhysteroscopic examinations on 618 women 45 years of age or older with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). Three hundred thirty-four (54%) had normal and functional or hypoatrophic endometrium, 78 (12.6%) had low-risk hyperplasia, 8 (1.3%) had high-risk hyperplasia, and 66 (10.6%) had adenocarcinoma. Correlation with histologic findings revealed the considerable diagnostic accuracy of the technique: its reliability approaches 100% when one deals with endometrial neoplasia, 87.5% with high-risk hyperplasia and 65.2% with low-risk hyperplasia. The diagnosis cannot rely on hysteroscopic examination only. A biopsy can be performed during the examination or immediately thereafter. In 54.1% of AUB patients, no endometrial changes could be detected on hysteroscopy and biopsy. Curettage, therefore, would have resulted in overtreatment of these patients. Moreover, the usefulness of dilatation and curettage in about half of AUB patients over 45 should be questioned seriously.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A study of pregnancy outcome was performed using a 1982-1985 regional network database of 60,456 infants. The perinatal mortality rate was 15.6 deaths per 1,000 births (total, 942), while the antepartum, intrapartum and neonatal mortality rates were 5.3, 1.6 and 8.7, respectively. Seven hundred forty-three multiple gestation pregnancies (1.2%) and 1,632 major congenital anomalies (2.7%) were identified. The corrected perinatal mortality rate was 13.8 deaths per 1,000 births. This study revealed that prematurity, postdatism, congenital anomalies, low Apgar scores and neonatal complications, including respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, persistent fetal circulation, intracerebral hemorrhage and seizure activity, were major factors contributing to mortality. This analysis suggests that a further reduction in mortality should follow a reduction in preterm deliveries and their sequelae and the early identification and management of maternal and fetal antenatal complications.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Triphasil, a low-dose combination oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, was tested in four Planned Parenthood clinics on 317 women between 18 and 34 years of age (mean, 23) for a total of 4,692 cycles, or 361 woman-years of usage. Approximately half these volunteers (165) were nulligravidas, and 309 (97.5%) were white. Despite instructions on proper tablet usage, there were 416 cycles (8.9%) in which one or more tablets were missed. Only one pregnancy occurred, in a cycle in which a total of four tablets was missed, for an uncorrected Pearl index of 0.28 pregnancies per 100 woman-years of usage. No pregnancy resulted from method failure, indicating a 100% efficacy rate for Triphasil when taken properly. The mean length of the menstrual cycle with Triphasil was 27.9 days; the mean length of menses, 4.4 days; and the mean latency period, 2.1 days. Menstrual flow was average in 64.1% of the subjects, light in 34.1%, heavy in 1.3% and variable in 0.5%. Amenorrhea during the tablet-free interval occurred in only 0.6% of the 4,692 cycles in which Triphasil was used. Breakthrough bleeding occurred in 6.9% of first cycles and 3.2% of total cycles; spotting, in 10.7% of first cycles and 4.4% of total cycles. Other symptoms that occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 1% were acne (1.0%), appetite increase (1.2%), breast discomfort (2.8%), breast enlargement (1.3%), gastrointestinal symptoms (1.7%), simple headache (1.4%) and nausea (1.1%).

<ABSTRACT>
- Both hyperprolactinemia and endometriosis are associated with infertility. A study was performed to ascertain whether sleep-related prolactin (PRL) hypersecretion was present in endometriosis. Fifty-five consecutive infertile women with regular menstrual cycles and admitted for diagnostic laparoscopy were studied. Blood samples were drawn throughout the night preceding surgery. Serum PRL, estradiol and progesterone levels were measured with radioimmunoassays. Nocturnal patterns of PRL secretion may be altered in infertile women with endometriosis, with an exaggerated and prolonged nocturnal peak. This alteration in PRL dynamics may contribute to infertility in women with endometriosis and may be a part of the pathophysiology of this disease.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Human papillomavirus (HPV) standardization and DNA cytophotometry were carried out in 29 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades I-III. A prognostically unfavorable DNA distribution pattern with an aneuploid stemline was found in 14 of the 16 dysplasias with HPV types 16 and 18, while in 11 of 13 dysplasias with HPV types 6 and 11 there was a favorable DNA distribution with a euploid-polyploid stemline. Among 178 colposcopically, cytologically and histologically confirmed cervical lesions, there was a statistically significant incidence of HPV 16/18 infections in severe dysplasias and carcinomas, while HPV 6/11 was found predominantly in mild cervical lesions. It seems that CIN can be divided into high- and low-risk lesions not only by the degree of severity and the DNA distribution pattern but also by HPV typing.</ABSTRACT>

- Both clinical rheumatology and medical rehabilitation have traditional functional assessment approaches to patients with arthritis. Drawing from both, a suggested "universe of function" for rheumatic disease patients is presented. The variables included begin with components of the physical examination and continue to maneuvers performed by the patient, mobility, activities of daily living (ADL), upper extremity function, extended living functions, and global assessment instruments. The development of standardized methodologic techniques is greater for some variables, especially ADL. In all, there is a need for a consensus approach so that aggregate data generated in different studies and programs will be more comparable.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The Functional Status Index: reliability and validity of a self-report functional disability measure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Practical, reliable and valid functional assessment instruments are needed to assist health providers in planning a patient's discharge from hospital and determining the need for rehabilitation or longterm care. In addition, such instruments can be used in clinical and epidemiological research. Several methods of assessing functional performance are available. Patient self-report offers many advantages: cost, speed of obtaining assessments and the potential for assessing a wide range of complex functional dimensions. Criticisms of this approach center around the degree to which the data are a reliable and valid reflection of patient function. We developed a Functional Status Index (FSI) and assessed its validity in 47 patients with hip fracture by comparing it to the results of objective functional performance tests. Our results indicate that patient self-report of function, if conducted with a structured, standardized format, yields data with considerable reliability and validity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Efficacy of psychoeducational interventions on pain, depression, and disability in people with arthritis: a meta-analysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Meta-analysis is a technique which combines data from several properly and similarly designed controlled studies so as to increase the power of the relevant statistical analysis. Fifteen studies on the effects of psychoeducational interventions on disability, pain and depression in individuals with chronic rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis were analyzed by this method. The results indicate that patient education can indeed contribute to improving the health status of such patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of the biomechanics laboratory in the analysis of the gait of individuals with arthritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The function of a biomechanics laboratory is to measure those aspects of an individual patient's performance that cannot be quantitatively assessed in the clinical setting. Essential equipment provides the ability to measure gait events, ground reactive forces, kinematics (movement of the body and its segments in 3 dimensions), electromyographic activity, and oxygen consumption. A minicomputer with video screen is required to process the data and allow visual checks of the functioning of the system. Such things as moments around joints and deforming forces may be calculated from the measured variables. Illustrations are given of a schematic laboratory system, computer generated stick diagrams, real-time changes in forces, moment-arms, moments, and excursions, in addition to the alteration of these variables in tibial nerve paralysis and degenerative arthritis of the knee.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- What faculty members value in practice plans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Faculty practice plans are under scrutiny at many academic medical centers as teaching hospitals seek ways to encourage their physicians to increase their clinical activities. Discussions with physicians at two medical schools yielded insights into the faculty members' perspective on faculty practice plans. Interviews disclosed that the physicians were satisfied with a practice plan if they felt their professional goals were in balance with the institution's goals. Changes in the plan can either sustain institutional values or introduce new priorities. In view of physicians' loyalty to a particular plan and their anxiety in the face of change, the authors suggest that it may be better to modify an established plan than to impose a new system. The physicians interviewed agreed that strong chairmen can work within any plan to reward faculty members for research, clinical, or administrative contributions and thus to determine a department's directions and character. In considering changes in a practice plan, chairmen, deans, and administrators need to weigh the faculty's values and commitments.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A comprehensive performance-based assessment of fourth-year students' clinical skills.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Written examinations are widely used for assessment in clinical clerkships and for licensure and specialty board certification, as opposed to assessment based on actual performance with patients. This reliance on written examinations is due to their ease of use and perceived objectivity and occurs despite the fact that the examinations assess few components of clinical competence. Simulated patients can standardize the presentation of a patient problem; and, if the patients are employed in an assessment in a manner parallel to the design of written test items, the assessment can have an objectivity similar to that enjoyed by written tests. Such an assessment allows the major components of clinical competence to be tested. The results and feasibility of using simulated patients in a multiple-station assessment of an entire senior class in January 1986 are described. A second assessment was administered to a different senior class in December 1986. This latter assessment was designed in collaboration with another medical school that administered the same assessment to its senior students in March 1987.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Geographic and specialty distributions of WAMI Program participants and nonparticipants.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In an effort to make the geographic distribution of physicians closer to the distribution of the population as a whole, in 1971 the states of Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho established the WAMI Program. In a departure from the Flexnerian model of medical education, the WAMI Program was organized to distribute the components of medical education throughout the region, both at the medical center at the University of Washington School of Medicine and at remote sites. In the present article, the authors describe the results of the first seven years of the program (1975-1981) in terms of the geographic and specialty distribution of the school's graduates before and after the establishment of the program. At the time of the study, 23 percent of the graduates with WAMI Program experience practiced in nonmetropolitan areas as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Only 13 percent of all U.S. physicians practiced in such areas in 1981, while 24 percent of the U.S. population lived there. In addition, 61 percent of the graduates with program experience were in primary care practice in contrast to 35 percent of all U.S. physicians. If all U.S. physicians behaved as these graduates do, the distribution of U.S. physicians would be reversed, with the proportion of physicians practicing primary care in nonmetropolitan areas being larger than the proportion of the population living in those areas.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Processing of critical information by physicians and medical students.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In the study reported here, differences between physicians and medical students in their recall of information from clinical problems were investigated. The focus of the study was on the recognition and recall of critical cues within cases as a function of problem difficulty and the organization of clinical information. Two clinical cases in two structural forms (typical and random) were designed, and the participants' written recall of the cases was analyzed using the techniques of discourse analysis. The results show that the physicians recalled significantly more critical cues than the medical students. However, when the case had a temporally ordered, underlying disease process, the random structure of the text disrupted both the physicians' ability to recall critical cues and the accuracy of their diagnoses. The medical students were unaffected by problem type or structural form in the amount of information they recalled. The results show that the physicians and medical students formulate the information from clinical problems differently, and this difference is due to the fact that the physicians recognize patterns of familiar problems with respect to critical cues but the students do not.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A computerized information management system for educational programs in the health sciences.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The Physician Assistant Program at the University of Florida has developed and implemented a computerized information management system that eliminates time-consuming duplication of effort in record-keeping and covers all functional components of the educational program. Data-base files for admissions, curriculum and/or evaluation design, student records, graduate follow-up, and research activities and a master file for administrative activities permit rapid accessing and transfer of information across files, continual updating of information, and efficient generating of records and reports pertaining to all program functions. Research about the program is enhanced through the correlation of data available in the five data-base files. This comprehensive system facilitates the audit of the program's educational process and the evaluation of its accomplishment of its stated objectives. The system can be easily adapted for use by other educational programs in medicine and the allied health sciences.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of curriculum and format changes in a medical pharmacology course, 1983 to 1987.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During the past five years, the medical pharmacology course at the University of Arkansas College of Medicine has changed from a poorly attended course in which students depended on "canned notes" (from a note-taking and note-distribution system organized among themselves) and had bad rapport with faculty members to a course in which attendance is high, the canned-notes system has been abandoned, and faculty-student interactions are generally pleasant. These changes in student behavior occurred during a period in which the pharmacology faculty implemented changes that anticipated the recommendations of the Panel on the General Professional Education of the Physician and College Preparation for Medicine of the Association of American Medical Colleges. These changes included encouraging independent learning, reduced lecture time, and increased problem-solving. The students' performance on the Part I examination of the National Board of Medical Examiners did not change during this period of curriculum revision.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nurses as evaluators of the humanistic behavior of internal medicine residents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The reliability of a 13-item questionnaire designed to assess the humanistic behaviors of internal medicine residents and the reliability of nurses as raters of those behaviors were examined. Twenty-five residents were evaluated by 10 or 11 nurses on two general medicine services and on cardiology and hematology-oncology services in a large, highly specialized department of internal medicine. Using an application of generalizability theory, which extends beyond classical test theory to establish estimates of multiple-error sources, the investigators calculated reliability-like coefficients for each of the services. The coefficients were .95 and .85 for the two general medicine services, .67 for cardiology, and .88 for hematology-oncology. These findings indicate that the questionnaire is a reliable instrument for assessing humanistic behavior and identifying reliable raters in groups of nurses.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Correlation of cerebral perfusion pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale to outcome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cerebral Perfusion Pressures (CPP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were monitored to guide the management of severely head-injured patients. These measures were correlated to outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale-GOS) in 136 consecutive patients at least 1 year after injury. The GOS showed highly significant positive correlations to either CPP or GCS assessments (p less than 0.001). Two parameters that are correlated with subsequent death in most patients include 1) highest (h) GCS = 3 or 4 (Day 1: 31 of 32 patients died, and Day 2: 19 of 19 patients died), and 2) CPP less than or equal to 60 mm Hg more than 33% of the hourly measures during Day 2 (36% of all subsequent deaths; 11% overlap with the highest Glasgow Coma Scale). The Day 2 measures identifying two groups that have a greater than 75% incidence of "good outcome" or GOS = 4 or 5 include 1) hGCS greater than or equal to 6 (N = 45) and 2) the average (a) CPP greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (N = 26). Of the 45 patients with a GOS = 4 or 5 who had both CPP and GCS recorded on the third day, 44 were identified by these "good outcome" parameters.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Incidence and effect of hypothermia in seriously injured patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hypothermia is a well recognized consequence of severe injury, even in temperate climates, and the physiologic consequences of hypothermia are known to be detrimental. To analyze the frequency and risk factors for hypothermia and its effect on patient outcome, we prospectively studied 94 intubated injured patients at a regional trauma center during a 16-month period. Esophageal temperature probes were placed in the field or ER and core temperatures (T) were followed for 24 hours or until rewarming. Patients were designated as normothermic (greater than 36 degrees C), mildly hypothermic (34 degrees C-36 degrees C) or severely hypothermic (less than 34 degrees C) based on initial T. The risk factors for hypothermia evaluated included age, severity and location of injuries, blood alcohol level, blood transfusion requirements, and time spent in the field, ER, or OR. The average initial T was 35 degrees C, with no seasonal variation. Injury severity and survival correlated with severe hypothermia. Normothermic patients had an average ISS of 28 with a 78% survival. Severely hypothermic patients had an average ISS of 36 with a 41% survival (p less than 0.05). Patient age strongly correlated with outcome although there was no relationship between age and initial temperature. Sixty-two per cent of patients tested were positive for blood alcohol, and one half were legally intoxicated (BAC greater than 100 mg%). However, no consistent correlation was found between alcohol intoxication and initial temperature or patient survival. Blood transfusion requirements paralleled injury severity and patients receiving greater than 10 unit transfusions had significantly lower core temperature (p less than 0.05). The average temperature change was positive in the ER, OR, and ICU with time to rewarming correlating with the aggressiveness of warming measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hypothermia in trauma victims: an ominous predictor of survival.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hypothermia in trauma patients is generally considered an ominous sign, although the actual temperature at which hypothermia affects survival is ill defined. In this study, the impact of body core hypothermia on outcome in 71 adult trauma patients with Injury Severity Scores (ISS) greater than or equal to 25 was analyzed. Forty-two per cent of the patients had a core temperature (Tc) below 34 degrees C, 23% below 33 degrees C, and 13% below 32 degrees C. The mortality of hypothermia patients was consistently greater than those who remained warm, regardless of index core temperature. Mortality if Tc less than 34 degrees C = 40%, less than 33 degrees C = 69%, less than 32 degrees C = 100%, whereas mortality if Tc greater than or equal to 34 degrees C = 7%, and greater than or equal to 32 degrees C = 10%. Mortality and the incidence of hypothermia increased with higher ISS, massive fluid resuscitation, and the presence of shock. Within each subgroup (i.e., greater ISS, massive fluid administration, shock) the mortality of hypothermic patients was significantly higher than those who remained warm. No patient whose core temperature fell below 32 degrees C survived.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regional blood flow in sciatic nerve, biceps femoris muscle, and truncal skin in response to hemorrhagic hypotension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Regional blood flow was measured simultaneously in rat sciatic nerves (NBF), truncal skin (SBF), and biceps femoris muscles (MBF) after graded hemorrhages. A modified 14C-butanol "indicator-fractionation" technique was used. In controls NBF was 11.4 +/- 1.38 ml X min-1 X 100 gm-1 and did not differ significantly between limbs. After hypotension, NBF was: 101 mm Hg, 7.7 +/- 1.3; 83 mm Hg, 5.3 +/- 0.6; 62 mm Hg, 4.1 +/- 0.6; 38 mm Hg, 3.1 +/- 0.3. The relationship between NBF and MAP was linear: (r = 0.56; p less than 0.001). SBF also declined linearly in hypotension (r = 0.54; p less than 0.01), but MBF did not change significantly. No significant change in nerve vascular resistance occurred with hypotension but muscle vascular resistance declined progressively. The data indicate a striking absence of autoregulation of NBF, but MBF, as expected, displayed close autoregulation. The vascular mechanisms which regulate resting NBF following hemorrhage differ from those in both muscle and skin: during hypotension, the calculated neurovascular resistance was unchanged, while the resistance in muscle fell and that in the skin increased.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Essential fatty acid status in isolated closed head injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Abnormal profiles of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma phospholipid fraction were observed in 14 patients with hypermetabolism due to severe isolated closed head injury. Depressed linoleic acid levels were observed within 24 hours along with elevation of oleic acid levels. By one week postinjury, subnormal levels of arachidonic acid were also observed. These data indicate that the metabolic response to injury encompasses changes in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids which are rapid in onset and qualitatively similar to those seen in mild essential fatty acid deficiency.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The epidemiology of logging injuries in the northwest.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Logging is among the most hazardous forms of employment. However, a comprehensive review of severe logging injuries and their outcome has apparently not been previously undertaken. In the present study we review 51 consecutive injured loggers requiring transfer to a regional Level I trauma center. The average age was 34 years and the mode of injury in 67% was being struck by a falling or rolling log. Orthopedic intervention was required most frequently (49%), with neurologic injury in 43%. Two patients died (4%), both secondary to severe head injury, and both survived less than 24 hours. Importantly, while most severely injured patients survived, they required long hospitalizations and had a 58% permanent disability, with more than half of these being brain or spinal cord related. Although the overall number of workers involved in logging is small, the young average age, the work years lost, and the high risk of permanent disability support continued strong efforts to improve overall safety. Particularly, the high incidence of head injury argues strongly for improved and increased use of safety helmets, which may significantly impact the mortality and morbidity of logging accidents.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- With increasing frequency trauma surgeons are advocating early internal fixation in open fractures. The effect of the fixation devices on the infection rate in contaminated wounds remains a concern as our clinical experience in this area has been mixed. To study the effects of internal fixation on bone infections a 3.5-mm stainless steel screw was inserted into rabbit femurs and the wounds contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus. The controls had the screw hole drilled and taped but the screw was not inserted. Thirty of 49 rabbits receiving the screw subsequently became infected whereas 19 of 56 control animals developed an infection. The difference was significant at the 0.05 confidence level.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Resistance of rapidly expanded random skin flaps to bacterial invasion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study tested the hypothesis that rapidly expanded random pattern skin flaps demonstrate enhanced resistance to bacterial invasion from intradermal injection of Staphylococcus aureus in a porcine model. Sites for a 6 X 12 cm expanded, a 6 X 9 cm sham-expanded, and a 6 X 6 cm acute random pattern skin flap were outlined, but not elevated, on the backs of 14 white pigs. A 450-cc tissue expander inserted beneath the panniculus carnosus at the site for expansion was sequentially filled to the limits of skin viability each day for 5 days. At the sham site a tissue expander was similarly inserted but left unexpanded; the acute flap site was left undisturbed. On day 8, flaps were elevated, immediately sutured in place, and 0.1 ml of saline solution containing 10(7) Staphylococcus aureus inoculated intradermally at four corresponding sites in each flap and at three sites in normal skin. In seven animals these sites were at the proximal base of the flaps; in seven others the sites were distal. The resulting areas of erythema and skin ulceration were measured on each of the next 3 days and the measurements compared. At corresponding proximal sites, the mean area of erythema and ulceration measured over the next 3 days in expanded flaps (31.2 mm2) and in sham-expanded flaps (33.8 mm2) was significantly less than in acute flaps and control skin (47.5 mm2, 43.4 mm2, p less than 0.05). Measurements in the rapidly expanded flaps were not significantly different than those in the sham-operated expanded flaps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Penetrating thoracic injuries: in-field stabilization vs. prompt transport.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred patients who were in extremis and required Emergency Room Thoracotomy (ERT) after sustaining penetrating thoracic injuries were analyzed to compare the results of attempted stabilization in the field (n = 51) with those who had immediate transportation (n = 49). The clinical status of the patients in the field and in the E.R. was quantified by Trauma Score (TS) as well as Physiologic Index (PI), ranging in severity from 20 (clinically dead) to 5 (stable). The anatomic injury severity was expressed by Penetrating Trauma Index (PTI). Survival was analyzed according to the type of injuries: noncardiac and cardiac. The overall survival was 10%. There was only one survivor with noncardiac injuries. Sixty-nine patients had cardiac penetration, 33 in Group I (stabilization) and 36 in Group II (immediate transport). Despite attempts at stabilization, none of the patients in Group I showed an improvement in clinical status from the scene to the emergency room. There were a higher number of patients arriving at the E.R. with signs of life in Group II compared to Group I. In Group II patients, survival was significantly improved overall (p = 0.01), in patients with signs of life on arrival at the hospital (p = 0.02) and in patients with isolated right ventricular wounds (p = 0.01) compared with Group I. The anatomic injury severity (PTI) as well as the mode of injury in the two groups was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Steroid administration potentiates urinary nitrogen losses in head-injured children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Exogenous steroid administration has been shown to increase post-traumatic nitrogen excretion in adults. Children sustaining head injuries and treated with steroids have previously been shown to have markedly increased total urinary nitrogen levels; the amount of nitrogen excreted is also directly related to the degree of injury, as evidenced by the Modified Injury Severity Score (MISS). It is unclear whether the increased protein breakdown in these patients is a result of the head injury or a result of the catabolic effects of steroids. Nineteen children aged 4-14 years, suffering head injuries, were prospectively studied. In ten children, management included steroid administration (1-1.5 mg/kg/day dexamethasone X 3-5 days); the remaining nine were similarly managed; however, without steroids. The groups were matched for age, weight, MISS, and Glasgow Coma Scale Score. The steroid-treated group showed a significantly higher urinary nitrogen excretion (mean, 256 +/- 24 mg/kg/day) than the nonsteroid-treated group (mean, 172 +/- 29 mg/kg/day) (p less than 0.02). These data suggest that steroids potentiate an already accelerated post-traumatic catabolic response seen in children with head injuries. Our data suggest that steroid use, which is common, mandates aggressive nutritional support in the management of children with head injuries.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Nonpenetrating traumatic ventricular septal defect is rare. A triad of blunt chest trauma, holosystolic precordial murmur, and ECG abnormalities should suggest the diagnosis. Surgical repair, when indicated by progressive failure, rising pulmonary artery pressures, or significant (2:1 or larger) left-to-right shunt, has been shown to be very effective. Optimally, a period of several weeks from the injury should elapse before operative intervention is undertaken. Intra-aortic balloon pump may be helpful to stabilize patients acutely, and, in selected instances, allow delay of surgical repair so that the tissue around the defect may hold sutures more securely.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1 June 1976 and 30 June 1985 Sunnybrook Medical Centre Regional Trauma Unit admitted 2,016 patients of whom 220 (11%) sustained liver injury. Of these 220 patients, 211 (96%) sustained blunt liver trauma; 175 of 176 patients who underwent open peritoneal lavage had a true positive lavage. Resuscitation was successful in 212 patients, of whom 209 underwent laparotomy and three were treated nonoperatively: 129 of 209 patients (62%) required only minor surgical treatment; the remaining 80 patients (38%) required major surgical procedures. The overall mortality was 29% (64/220). Eight patients died during resuscitation, one of them of liver hemorrhage. Of the 56 patients who died after admission, the cause of death was head injury in 31, liver hemorrhage in 11 (five intraoperatively) and 14 died of other causes. Overall, liver hemorrhage was the cause of death in 12 of 64 deaths (19%). In other words, 12 of the total of 220 patients (6%) died from liver-related mortality.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mortality and morbidity related to severe intrapulmonary shunting in multiple trauma patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Of 210 multiple trauma patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 12 (5%) presented with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure needing mechanical ventilation with an FIO2 of 1.0 because of severe intrapulmonary shunting (IS). Five (42%) of these patients survived and two (17%) died because of their underlying respiratory failure. We found a mean of three etiologic factors in each patient to account for their IS. Nonsurvivors had a lower cardiac index than survivors when they first needed FIO2 of 1.0 and ARDS was more frequent among this group. All patients who survived were in severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in the first 5 days post-trauma; all patients who needed FIO2 of 1.0 later than 5 days post-trauma died. Data collected for patients with similar degree of respiratory failure in coronary care ICU (n = 18), in medical ICU (n = 19), and surgical ICU (n = 21) demonstrated that multiple trauma patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure were younger and were hospitalized and ventilated for longer periods of time. In multiple trauma patients, as for patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, death was seldom related to respiratory failure itself. We concluded that severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in trauma patients is usually of mixed etiologies. It is a serious cause of morbidity in these patients; however, mortality is seldom directly related to this condition. Severe IS occurring shortly after trauma is of better prognosis than late IS.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The pediatric passenger: trends in seatbelt use and injury patterns.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Injury patterns and use of passenger restraints were studied in 91 children injured while riding in motor vehicles and admitted to The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, from June 1984 through December 1985. Of theses, 44 had used restraints and 38 had not. Nine were excluded from the study because restraint use could not be determined. Age and sex distributions were closely matched in both study groups. The no-restraint group had more massive head injuries, thoracic injuries, and liver and spleen injuries than the restraint group. Classic "seatbelt syndrome" injuries were seen in the seatbelt group. The overall Injury Severity Scores were not significantly different between the groups. Despite mandatory legislation, many children do not use restraints, and many who do still suffer severe or fatal injuries. We conclude that better compliance with existing passenger restraint laws and more effective restraint systems are needed.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Seventy cases of blunt splenic trauma were retrospectively reviewed for the period 1979-1984. There were 57 adults and 13 children. Motor vehicle accidents were implicated in 62%. Forty-five splenectomies and eight splenorrhaphies were performed. The patients fell into two groups. Group A, numbering 48 patients, were those operated upon within 24 hours of injury. The mortality rate was 16%, and no deaths were attributable to splenic injury. Indications for surgery were hemodynamic instability in 46% and positive peritoneal lavage in 40%. Group B included 22 patients, 17 of whom were managed nonoperatively with no deaths. Five patients eventually went to laparotomy. Fifty per cent of all patients had associated intra-abdominal injury but only 17% needed repair; 31% of patients were initially managed conservatively with a 77% success rate and no mortality. It is concluded that conservative management is safe in stable patients with blunt splenic trauma.</ABSTRACT>

Two hundred fifty-three patients with 274 spinal injuries were reviewed at the time of injury and discharge from hospital, as well as at 1, 2, and 5 years postinjury. Thirty-eight of these patients were identified who had been misdiagnosed at the initial assessment. Fracture location, cause of injury, neurologic deficit, and delay in diagnosis were all documented: 22.9% of cervical injuries, and 4.9% of the thoracolumbar injuries had a delayed diagnosis ranging from less than 1 day to 36 days. The causes of delayed diagnosis were: 1) failure to take X-rays, 2) fractures missed on X-ray, and 3) failure of patients to seek medical attention. Associated factors such as intoxication of the patient, multiple injuries, level of consciousness, or two levels of spinal injury contributed to the delayed diagnosis of these injuries. Certain "at-risk" populations for missed spinal injuries have been identified. In spite of delays in diagnosis, progression of an established neurologic deficit did not appear to occur in our study. However, the development of secondary deficits was significant in the delayed diagnosis group.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diaphragmatic trauma in southern Saskatchewan--an 11-year review.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An 11-year retrospective review of 51 patients with diaphragmatic injuries revealed 33 blunt and 18 penetrating injuries. In the blunt trauma group 24 were left-sided and nine were on the right side. Preoperative diagnosis was made in 24 patients. Delayed diagnosis (greater than 24 hours) during life occurred in four patients and two injuries were found at autopsy. Chest X-ray was diagnostic or highly suggestive in 23 patients. All patients in this group had associated extra-abdominal injuries; 23 patients had concomitant intraabdominal injuries. Transabdominal repair was performed in 24 patients. Four deaths occurred in the blunt injury group. The penetrating diaphragmatic wounds consisted of 14 left-sided, three right-sided, and one pericardial wound. Preoperative diagnosis occurred in only three patients. The penetrating wound, hypotension, or peritoneal signs dictated operation in the remaining 15 patients. One death occurred from peritonitis and septic shock. Blunt and penetrating diaphragmatic injuries remain a diagnostic challenge and associated injuries determine the outcome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Penetrating chest trauma: a 20-year experience.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- From 1965 to 1985, 76 patients were admitted to Sacre-Coeur Hospital, Montreal, with a diagnosis of penetrating chest trauma (PCT). The majority were under the age of 30 years and almost two thirds suffered gunshot wounds. Sixty-seven (88.1%) sustained a lateral or thoracic (T) injury and in nine (11.8%) the lesion was central or mediastinal (M). In the first group (T), 53.7% were treated surgically with thoracotomy, laparotomy, and chest tube (CT) insertion or both; 46.2% were managed conservatively. In the second group (M) the pericardium or the heart was involved, eight patients (88.8%) were managed surgically without the use of extracorporeal circulation and one patient was observed only. Eight (11.9%) died in the thoracic group; all survived in the mediastinal group, for an overall mortality of 10.5%. Shock was associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the thoracic group (T) and infection was the most frequent complication for the entire group of patients under study. There has been a steady increase in the total number of PCT at our hospital during the last two decades suggesting an increase in crime and violence in our urban surroundings.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Delayed posterior internal fixation of unstable pelvic fractures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifteen patients with unstable pelvic fractures were treated with immediate anterior external fixation followed by delayed posterior fixation, including five sacroiliac lag screws, six transiliac rods, and four iliac plates. Initial anterior external fixation aided in resuscitation of hemodynamically unstable patients and allowed early mobilization. Delayed posterior internal fixation avoided infection and hemorrhage but failed to achieve anatomic reduction of disrupted sacroiliac joints and sacral fractures. Followup examination confirmed maintenance of fixation and fracture healing but pain and persistent neurologic deficits were common findings. Lumbosacral nerve plexus injuries occurred in patients with fractures through the sacral foramina. Fixation of these fractures with sacroiliac screws and transiliac rods caused overcompression and the resulting foraminal encroachment may be a factor in the lack of neurologic recovery. In this study, delayed posterior internal fixation was not associated with perioperative morbidity and achieved better reductions than those obtained with external fixation alone. Delaying the fixation, however, increased the difficulty of obtaining anatomic reduction of certain posterior arch disruptions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percutaneous renal calculus removal in an extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy practice.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The introduction of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and transurethral ureteroscopy have altered markedly the incidence of standard surgical and percutaneous stone removal procedures. To help define the present role of percutaneous procedures in our practice we evaluated our indications, results and the clinical course of 143 patients who were treated primarily with percutaneous methods during 1 year in which extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy also was available. The complexity of these residual percutaneous cases necessitated repeat endoscopic or fluoroscopic stone removal procedures in 20 per cent and ancillary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in 22 per cent, and led to a slightly higher complication rate than in our previous percutaneous series. Despite the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous methods still are necessary for comprehensive therapy of upper tract urolithiasis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Patient exposure and radiation environment of an extracorporeal shock wave lithotriptor system.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Radiation exposures to the patient undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy were assessed along with the scattered radiation levels around the lithotriptor systems. The data gathered from 2 Dornier lithotriptor systems suggest that the lead shieldings required for this particular make and model are minimal. Owing to the physical size of the lithotriptor system, the treatment room housing it may not require additional lead shielding when the walls are constructed with appropriate materials. Typical radiation exposures to the patient have been assessed from the experimental data. The total amount of radiation exposures a patient is likely to receive has been estimated to be approximately 26 roentgens, for example 21 roentgens from 3 to 4 minutes of fluoroscopic exposure and 5 roentgens from 8 frames of video spot filming. The scattered radiation has been found to be approximately 0.5 mR. per hour at 3 feet or 91 cm. from the center of the lithotriptor water tank.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Radiation dose to patient and personnel during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Radiation dose to the patient and personnel was determined during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatment of 60 patients. Surface radiation dose to the patient's back from the fluoroscopy unit on the side with the kidney stone averaged 10 rem (100 mSv.) per case, although the range was wide (1 to 30 rem). The surface dose from the opposing biplane x-ray unit was less, averaging 5.5 rem (55 mSv.) per case but again with a wide range (0.1 to 21 rem). Exit dose at the lower abdomen averaged 13 mrem. (0.13 mSv.) per case and estimated female gonad dose averaged 100 mrem. (1.2 mSv.). Radiation dose to personnel working in the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy suite averaged less than 2 mrem. (0.02 mSv.) per case, making it a procedure that is safe in regard to radiation exposure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Management of upper ureteral calculi with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The results of 471 extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatments in 465 patients with solitary ureteral stones managed by several different techniques are reported. In situ treatment was performed in 123 cases without instrumentation and in 47 after placement of a ureteral catheter. Retrograde stone manipulation was performed in 245 cases immediately before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and an additional 56 were manipulated with ureteral stent placement at least 1 week before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. The success rate was significantly greater if the stone was manipulated into the kidney before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Significantly less energy (p less than 0.0001) was required for complete disintegration if the stone was free floating in the kidney. The need for subsequent procedures was significantly less (p less than 0.0001) for stones manipulated successfully into the kidney. Complications were infrequent, with the most common being ureteral perforation in 5.1 per cent of the cases, all of which were managed conservatively. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is the treatment of choice for proximal ureteral calculi because it is less morbid than percutaneous approaches and provides significantly better results than ureteroscopy. An attempt at manipulation of proximal ureteral calculi back into the kidney should be made before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Three patients with lower urinary tract fistulas after multiple operations and radiation therapy for pelvic cancer were treated with percutaneous ureteral fulguration and nephrostomy tube drainage. This technique occluded the ureter and allowed for maintenance of a dry fistula site in all 3 patients. There were no complications. The longest followup in these patients was 21 months. The procedure is simple technically and it can be performed with the patient under local anesthesia. The technique of percutaneous ureteral fulguration is described and other techniques for nonoperative occlusion of the ureter are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The occurrence of vasculitis in perianeurysmal fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The histological findings of retroperitoneal fibrosis in 17 operated patients are described. Of these patients 6 showed a simultaneous aneurysm of the abdominal aorta verified either by computerized tomography, ultrasound, arteriography or during an operation. Of the patients 14 were operated on primarily because of ureteral obstruction, 2 because of aortic aneurysm and 1 because of rupture of the abdominal aorta. Advanced fibrosis with varying amounts of inflammation was detected in all 17 patients. The same histological pattern was present in patients with aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and in those without aneurysm. Accompanying vasculitis with destruction of the vascular wall was noted in 8 patients, including 6 with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In 3 patients who underwent aneurysm resection as well as in 1 patient with aortic rupture the process extended into the aortic wall. The only patient with vasculitis and no aortic process suffers from severe rheumatoid arthritis. On the basis of the different histological findings we suggest that retroperitoneal fibrosis with vasculitis and aneurysm may represent a distinct pathological entity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Remodeled right colon: an alternative urinary reservoir.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A total of 11 patients underwent bladder substitution or continent supravesical diversion with a remodeled right colonic segment as a urinary reservoir. Of the patients 1 woman and 2 men had bladder substitution: in 2 the bladder neck and urethra were preserved, and in 1 man radical cystoprostatectomy with preservation of the distal sphincteric mechanism was performed. All 3 patients currently are continent. In the 8 diversion patients an anti-incontinence mechanism was reconstructed with a segment of plicated ileum sutured to the abdominal wall. Six patients are completely dry between catheterizations every 4 to 6 hours, 1 man requires more frequent catheterizations, and the woman has refused self-catheterization and wears an external appliance. There were 18 ureterointestinal reimplantations performed successfully for upper tract protection, and 1 ureterocolonic reimplantation became partially obstructed and required percutaneous dilation. Reflux did not occur. This remodeled right colonic segment, reconstructed with interruption of the intestinal circular fibers, allows for storage of large urine volumes at reasonable pressures and it is a suitable alternative bladder substitution procedure. Plicated ileum has allowed for easy catheterization and it has been an adequate anti-incontinence mechanism when associated with this colonic reservoir.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of liquid diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (Lomotil) instillations on dynamics and function of continent cecal urinary reservoirs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We assessed the impact of twice daily instillations of 10 ml. liquid diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate (Lomotil) on the dynamics and function of continent urinary reservoirs constructed from intact cecum and ascending colon. Six patients were treated for 1 to 3 weeks at 3 to 8 months postoperatively. The treatments reduced the frequency of spontaneous reservoir contractions, as well as the basal and contraction pressures of the reservoirs. The reservoir capacities were increased modestly. These alterations in reservoir dynamics were accompanied by a decrease in the cramping characteristically associated with reservoir distension and increased intervals between reservoir catheterization. Two patients who had incontinence after initially successful operations regained continence during treatment. No systemic side effects were observed, although dilution of the drug may be required to prevent reservoir irritability. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate instillations may prevent acute and possibly long-term pressure-related complications of continent urinary reservoirs constructed from intact cecum and ascending colon.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Functional characteristics of the Camey ileal bladder.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied postoperatively 14 men who underwent urinary diversion with a Camey ileal bladder in association with radical cystoprostatectomy. Clinical and urodynamic evaluations revealed that the ileal bladder provides a moderate pressure reservoir (mean pressure at capacity 37 cm. water) and offers the patient reliable daytime continence. The mean capacity of 362 ml. allows for a voiding interval of 2.2 hours but it is not adequate for storage of urine produced through the night, so that nocturnal enuresis results universally. Even after 2 years of followup the tubular-shaped ileal reservoir maintained physiological contraction waves of segmentation and peristalsis typical of human ileum. Voiding is accomplished by abdominal straining and an intraluminal pressure of more than 50 cm. water is required to maintain the urine flow. Mean peak flow rate was 19 ml. per second. Reflux was prevented successfully in 86 per cent of the renal units. Metabolic acidosis was seen in 43 per cent of the patients. While the ileal bladder falls short of being the ideal form of continent urinary diversion, it offers a psychologically attractive technique to selected and highly motivated male patients faced with the need for urinary diversion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Features of 164 bladder ruptures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We reviewed 164 cases of bladder rupture from external trauma. Of these patients 145 (88 per cent) suffered blunt trauma, and 59 (35.5 per cent) suffered intraperitoneal, 93 (57.5 per cent) extraperitoneal and 12 (7 per cent) both types of rupture. Bladder rupture owing to blunt trauma was caused by a compression (burst) type of injury in all patients with intraperitoneal rupture and in 24 per cent of those with extraperitoneal rupture. In the remaining instances of extraperitoneal rupture pelvic bone fragments corresponded to the site of the injury. Although surgical repair has been the traditional method of management of all bladder ruptures, nonoperative (catheter) management of extraperitoneal rupture was successful in most cases.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Correlation of histopathological, cytological and flow cytometric findings in neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the bladder.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Biopsy diagnosis, urine cytology and flow cytometry features of urine and bladder washings were compared in 81 cases of benign and malignant bladder disease. Some patients were followed by urine cytology and flow cytometry during treatment of tumors. There was a good correlation of the 3 parameters in relatively high grade tumors (II and III) but an inconsistent appearance of cells in the urine diagnosable by either urine cytology or flow cytometry for low grade lesions. High grade flat neoplasms may be detectable by urine cytology and flow cytometry before they are visible on endoscopy. Flow cytometry may indicate urothelial proliferation before it is apparent on urine cytology. Exfoliative benign lesions are diagnosed readily by the combination of urine cytology and flow cytometry. In benign and malignant lesions shedding of viable cells and, therefore, accessibility to urine cytology and flow cytometry are inconsistent. The need for repeated examinations in the case of low grade lesions suggests that the method is not reliable for single test screening programs but it is a valuable means of followup in cases of suspected or diagnosed disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of blood group type on the natural history of superficial bladder cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The blood group was correlated with the grade and stage at diagnosis, and with the subsequent clinical course in 494 patients with bladder cancer treated at our institution from 1977 to 1986 who were followed for a mean of 5.5 years (range 2 to 9 years). The distribution of blood groups was similar to that reported for the general population and to that of 100 consecutive patients with urolithiasis used as controls, and the distribution was not different among patients with superficial cancer (stages O and A) than in those with advanced disease (stage B or higher). However, among patients with superficial disease high grade (III or IV) lesions were more frequent in those with blood group O (36 per cent) than in those with other blood groups (13 to 18 per cent) (p less than 0.001). In addition, in patients with superficial cancer of all grades progression to advanced disease was significantly greater among those with blood group O (37 per cent) than in those with other groups (12 to 16 per cent) (p less than 0.05). More importantly, in patients with low grade (I or II) superficial cancer development of advanced disease was significantly more frequent among those with blood group O (24 per cent) than in those with other blood groups (0 to 7 per cent) (p less than 0.004). Our findings suggest that individual genetic factors influence the natural history of superficial bladder cancer. The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains to be elucidated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Monitoring endoscopic treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma by postoperative urinary cytology.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Transurethral resection was the only modality of treatment in 39 patients with long-standing, recurrent, superficial bladder carcinoma. Postoperative urinary cytology was performed within 3 days of each endoscopy. Tumor recurrence was defined by the presence of a positive biopsy or visible papillary tumors on followup cystoscopic examination. Tumor recurred in 38 patients (97.4 per cent) and 1 patient (2.6 per cent) has remained free of disease 74 months following transient positive postoperative cytology. Among the 38 recurrences 15 (39.5 per cent) were positive, 3 (7.9 per cent) suspicious and 20 (52.6 per cent) negative at the postoperative cytological examination. The interval to recurrence did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. The failure of a negative postoperative cytology study to predict a durable response to treatment by transurethral resection reflects the polychronotopic nature of superficial bladder tumors in this select patient population and suggests the need for adjuvant therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We studied 51 patients with superficial bladder carcinoma who had been treated with transurethral resection of all gross tumor followed by intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin weekly for 6 weeks. Within 72 hours of either the first or second quarterly cystoscopic surveillance examination after bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy, a conventional cytology study was obtained. Of these patients 8 (15.7 per cent) had positive, 9 (17.6 per cent) suspicious and 34 (66.7 per cent) negative postoperative cytology studies. Subsequent tumor recurrence was defined as a positive biopsy or visible papillary tumors on cystoscopic examination. All 8 patients with a positive postoperative cytology study had tumor recurrence at a median interval of 4 months. Of the 9 patients with a suspicious study 7 (77.8 per cent) had recurrent tumor at a median interval of 7 months and 2 (22.2 per cent) had no evidence of disease at 16 and 19 months, respectively. Of the 34 patients with a negative postoperative cytology study 13 (38.2 per cent) had tumor recurrence after a median interval of 4 months and 21 (67.8 per cent) had no evidence of disease after a median of 25 months. The tumor recurrence rate in patients with a positive or suspicious postoperative cytology study was significantly greater than that of patients with a negative study (p equals 0.001, Fisher's exact test). Postoperative cytology appears to be a significant prognostic indicator following transurethral resection and intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The outcome of conservative treatment of carcinoma in situ of the bladder.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We treated 52 patients with carcinoma in situ by transurethral resection, thiotepa and other intravesical chemotherapeutic agents. All patients underwent standard initial and subsequent evaluative procedures and the average followup was 62 months. Half of the patients had a history of stage Ta and/or T1 transitional cell carcinoma. The remainder had carcinoma in situ when first diagnosed (10 had carcinoma in situ only). Of 12 patients treated by transurethral resection alone 1 reached 60 months without radical cystectomy or disease progression. There were 18 patients who had a complete response following chemotherapy, 11 had a partial response (positive cytology) and 11 failed (persistent carcinoma in situ). Patients with a history of transitional cell carcinoma had a statistically significantly greater probability of achieving a complete response. Despite other types of treatments only 2 of 22 patients (partial response and failure) achieved a lasting complete response. Persistent partial response and failure resulted in progressive transitional cell carcinoma (stage T2 or greater, prostatic involvement and metastases) and only 1 of these survived for more than 5 years without cystectomy. None of our patients received bacillus Calmette-Guerin because it was not available during the time most of the patients were treated. While the lives and bladders in some patients may be spared by its use, failure to achieve a complete response indicates impending disaster and cystectomy should be considered seriously.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective review of our experience with the artificial urinary sphincter in 32 women is presented. All patients had a history of recurrent urinary incontinence after failed bladder suspension procedures. Of 32 devices 31 were functioning, with an average followup of 2.5 years, and 91 per cent of the patients were dry without pads. Mechanical complications requiring surgical repair occurred in 21 per cent of the patients. Indications for artificial urinary sphincter implantation in the female patient and technical aspects of the procedure are discussed.

<ABSTRACT>
- A study was conducted to assess the discriminant validity of patient responses to a questionnaire in distinguishing between organic and psychogenic erectile dysfunction. A total of 56 urologist-referred veterans slept for 3 nights in a sleep laboratory for nocturnal penile tumescence recording. Based on nocturnal penile tumescence results 48 patients were assigned to an organic group and the remaining 8 were assigned to a psychogenic group. A discriminant function analysis of questionnaire responses yielded a highly significant discriminant function [chi-square (19) equals 63.88, p less than 10(-6)], and all 56 patients were classified correctly into the nocturnal penile tumescence-defined organic and psychogenic groups. It was concluded that verbally reported data contain diagnostically meaningful information and that such information can compare favorably with information collected through standard laboratory-based nocturnal penile tumescence techniques.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Spongiosolysis: a new surgical treatment of impotence caused by distal venous leakage.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Until recently ligation of the dorsal veins of the penis had been the only effective surgical treatment in cases of erectile dysfunction caused by venous insufficiency of the corpora cavernosa. Failure of this operation can be owing to persistent distal venous leakage consisting of venous shunts between the distal corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, which can be demonstrated by cavernosography. These shunts can be closed successfully by spongiosolysis, that is by dissecting the distal half of the corpus spongiosum and by isolating the tips of the corpora cavernosa. Of 5 patients who underwent spongiosolysis after previous ligation of the dorsal vein of the penis 4 regained erectile ability with the help of intracavernous injection of a vasoactive drug mixture (15 mg. per ml. papaverine hydrochloride plus 0.5 mg. per ml. phentolamine mesylate, 0.5 to 2 ml. per injection), which was necessary because of concomitant arterial lesions demonstrated by arteriography. The only failure proved to be persistent venous insufficiency of the deep dorsal vein of the penis. Since none of the patients had any serious complication spongiosolysis seems to be a safe procedure in the treatment of distal venous leakage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cyclophosphamide and sequential cisplatin for advanced seminoma: long-term followup in 52 patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifty-two patients with advanced seminoma were treated with primary chemotherapy: 44 received cyclophosphamide and weekly cisplatin, and 8 received sequential weekly cisplatin alone. Of the patients treated with chemotherapy alone only 44 achieved a complete remission and 4 were salvaged with further therapy (1 chemotherapy and 3 radiation therapy). These 48 patients (92 per cent) remained free of disease at a followup of 30 to 471 weeks. Six prognostic factors were tested by univariate analysis (chi-square) and only the use of previous chemotherapy predicted for a lower complete remission rate (p equals 0.02). Renal toxicity (greater than 0.4 mg. per dl. increase in serum creatinine) occurred in 2 patients (4 per cent). Neurotoxicity occurred in 16 patients (31 per cent). No fatal toxicity occurred. Cyclophosphamide and weekly cisplatin were well tolerated in patients previously treated with radiation therapy and is the treatment of choice for patients with disseminated seminoma.</ABSTRACT>

- Cytological grade determined by fine needle aspiration of the prostate was compared to histological grade in 30 patients undergoing subsequent radical prostatectomy. The degree of cytological pleomorphism determined by the consensus grade of 3 observers predicted correctly the Gleason grade sum range in 80 per cent of the cases. The cytological grade was reasonably reproducible with agreement among all 3 observers in 50 per cent of the cases and between 2 of 3 observers in the remainder. The accuracy of predicting the Gleason grade sum of the radical prostatectomy specimen by cytological examination compared favorably with that achieved by histological examination of cutting needle biopsy and transurethral resection specimens reported in the literature.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgical treatment of locally advanced (T3) prostatic carcinoma: early results.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The fate of 48 patients with clinical stage T3 prostatic carcinoma after attempted curative surgical management was studied. In 23 of these patients positive frozen sections of the lymph nodes were found at pelvic lymphadenectomy and orchiectomy was performed. The median interval to progression was 61 months. Radical prostatectomy was performed in the remaining 25 patients. In 4 of these patients positive lymph nodes were found on paraffin sections but no additional treatment was given. Over-all, total tumor removal as defined by negative lymph nodes and negative margins of resection could be achieved in 14 of the 48 patients (29 per cent). During the same period 34 patients with clinical state T less than 3 prostatic carcinoma were treated in a similar manner. Orchiectomy was done in 4 patients because of positive frozen sections of the lymph nodes and radical prostatectomy was done in 30, including 1 in whom positive paraffin sections of the lymph nodes were found but no additional treatment was given. An attempt was made to study the impact of several prognostic factors by comparing the probability of progression between patients with stage pT3 disease with (T3pT3N0) or without (T less than 3pT3N0) extracapsular tumor growth as determined by preoperative rectal examination (36 versus 27 per cent progression at 3 years), with or without positive margins of resection (45 versus 20 per cent progression at 3 years) and with or without involvement of the seminal vesicles (47 versus 18 per cent progression at 3 years). Our results suggest that a certain proportion of patients with clinical stage T3 disease will benefit from radical prostatectomy. This is to be expected especially in patients with stage T3pT3N0 cancer and negative margins.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Potency following radical prostatectomy with wide unilateral excision of the neurovascular bundle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Delineation of the neurovascular bundles has made it possible to identify the branches of the pelvic plexus to the corpora cavernosa intraoperatively and to decide whether the bundles can be preserved or resected widely with the specimen. In the course of performing 312 radical retropubic prostatectomies the neurovascular bundle was widely excised unilaterally in 49 men with advanced clinical disease in whom, based on preoperative or intraoperative assessment, the bundle appeared to be involved by tumor. Because of this selection criterion these patients had higher clinical stage (52 per cent had clinical stage B2) and pathological stage (35 per cent had microscopic involvement of pelvic lymph nodes) disease than our previously reported series. In 38 patients the margins of resection were negative for tumor. In 11 patients despite attempts at wide excision of the lesion the surgical margins of resection were positive. In all 11 men with positive surgical margins there was extensive periprostatic extension of tumor and 8 had involvement of the pelvic lymph nodes. However, in none of the 11 patients with positive surgical margins were the margins positive only at the site where the bundle was spared, which shows that unilateral sparing of the neurovascular bundle did not compromise removal of tumor. Of the 29 men who were potent preoperatively and who have been followed for 1 year or longer postoperatively 20 (69 per cent) are potent. The return of sexual function correlated with age: 5 of 5 men (100 per cent) 40 to 49 years old were potent postoperatively compared to 8 of 10 (80 per cent) 50 to 59 years old and 7 of 14 (50 per cent) 60 to 69 years old. Histological evaluation of the resected specimens revealed that some of the men who were potent postoperatively had soft tissue and nerves resected in the region of the contralateral spared neurovascular bundle. By measuring nerves in the spared region of the neurovascular bundle we found that the role of the neurovascular bundles in potency is not owing to large nerves but to many nerves of varying size. In conclusion, potency can be maintained after radical prostatectomy in most patients in whom it is necessary to excise 1 neurovascular bundle widely without compromising the removal of tumor.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Urodynamic evaluation of patients after the Camey operation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ten patients were evaluated urodynamically 3 to 18 months after they underwent the Camey operation. Of these patients 2 had total diurnal and nocturnal continence, 1 was totally incontinent and 6 were incontinent to various degrees that necessitated the use of 1 to 3 pads or diapers per day. All but 2 of the Camey neobladders had cystoplasty contractions at a capacity of 50 to 200 ml. The 2 totally continent patients had no cystoplasty contractions. The bladder in the totally incontinent patient had good capacity, good compliance and low pressure contractions up to a volume of 400 ml. The condition in this patient may be attributed to sphincteric incontinence. Urinary flow is achieved by abdominal straining and is interrupted. Vesicoureteral reflux occurred in 3 of 20 renal units.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Neurological evaluation was performed in 24 men and 5 women with Parkinson's disease who had persistent bladder symptoms. Detrusor hyperreflexia was found in 26 (90 per cent) of the patients. Sporadic involuntary electromyography activity of the external sphincter during involuntary detrusor contractions was encountered in 61 per cent but in none did this cause obstruction. Coordinated striated sphincter relaxation during voluntary detrusor contraction was found in 13 patients (45 per cent). Among 22 men who were in the prostatic disease age group only 4 (18 per cent) had definite prostatic obstruction. Moreover, none of 8 men with persistent symptoms after prostatectomy had evidence of bladder outlet obstruction.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Radionuclide renography showed an obstructed pattern in 6 patients with meningomyelocele without dilatation of the upper urinary tract or reflux when the bladder was filled to the volume that during previous urodynamic testing had resulted in an intravesical pressure of 40 cm. water but not when these patients were studied with an empty bladder. Therefore, this study indicates that treatment should be directed at avoiding long-standing intravesical pressure exceeding 40 cm. water in patients with meningomyelocele.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A rehabilitation program has been developed for children with functional, nonneurogenic bladder disturbance. The basis for the program is a bladder regimen supplemented by biofeedback training if needed. Results in the first 70 children (64 girls and 6 boys) are presented. After 1 and 3 years 36 and 53 children, respectively, had completely normalized voiding patterns, that is they were continent, had no urgency, voided 3 to 6 times a day and emptied the bladder completely in 1 portion with a normal flow rate. The training program is applicable in children with varying urodynamic diagnoses and it has been used in children as young as 4 years old.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Neuropeptide Y- and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-containing nerves in the intrinsic external urethral sphincter in the areflexic bladder compared to detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in patients with spinal cord injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Specimens of urethra were obtained from patients with cervical and thoracic spinal cord lesion with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and from patients with lower motor neurone lesion with detrusor areflexia, undergoing transurethral sphincterotomy. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in nerves associated with both the smooth and striated muscle components of the urethral sphincter were studied immunohistochemically and by immunoassay. In patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia following cervical and thoracic spinal cord injury, NPY- and VIP-immunoreactive varicose nerve fibres were seen in both the smooth and striated muscle components of the urethral sphincter. In the smooth muscle, NPY- and VIP-immunoreactive nerves did not appear to have any particular orientation, but in the striated muscle region they were found to run along the length of individual muscle fibres. In patients with detrusor areflexia following lower motor neurone lesion, while the pattern, density and fluorescence intensity of NPY- and VIP-immunoreactive nerves in the smooth muscle of the sphincter mechanism appeared the same as seen in patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, there was a marked increase in the density of these nerves in the striated muscle region of the sphincter mechanism. Quantitation of the peptides by immunoassay was consistent with the histochemical findings, with significantly higher levels of both NPY and VIP in the striated muscle of patients with lower motor neurone lesion, compared to those with cervical and thoracic spinal cord lesion, p = 0.04. NPY and VIP levels in urethral smooth muscle were in the same range in lower motor neurone lesion patients and cervical and thoracic spinal cord lesion patients. We conclude that there are increased NPY- and VIP-containing fibres in striated muscle of the intrinsic external urethral sphincter in patients with areflexic bladder compared with those with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Urothelial injury to the rabbit bladder from alkaline irrigants useful in the treatment of uric acid stones.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Irrigation of the urinary tract with alkaline solutions may be used appropriately in some clinical situations to dissolve uric acid stones. Since in vitro studies have suggested that tham-E (pH 10.6) is somewhat more effective than tham (pH 8.6) in promoting dissolution of uric acid, these studies were undertaken to assess the relative toxicities of these two irrigating solutions to the urothelium. Rabbit bladders were irrigated antegrade via a ureterotomy for twenty hours. Tham E produced considerably more mucosal injury than did tham (p = 0.0001). The minimal advantage in rapidity of stone dissolution offered by tham E over tham is more than offset by the considerably increased potential for toxic side effects. The results suggest tham and not tham E should be used for irrigation to dissolve uric acid stones.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Formation of encrustations on indwelling urinary catheters in the elderly: a comparison of different types of catheter materials in "blockers" and "nonblockers".</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In order to determine the effect of catheter materials on formation of encrustations in long-term indwelling urinary catheters in the elderly we performed a crossover study utilizing commercially available silicone, silicone-coated, teflon-coated and latex catheters that were left in place for 14 days. The study was conducted with #18 french catheters fitted with a 30 ml. balloon since smaller size catheters frequently fell out spontaneously. The distinction between patients who were "blockers" and "nonblockers" was found to be clinically useful since "nonblockers", who constituted about half the population, did well regardless of type of catheter material used. Formation of encrustations and blockage was significantly less in "blockers" with silicone than with teflon-coated or latex catheters. The more rapid flow-time through silicone catheters appears to be related to a larger bore. Although this study supports the use of silicone catheters for "blockers" on long-term drainage the results should not be interpreted to imply that they are preferable to other types of catheters for short-term use or to changing less expensive catheters more frequently when needed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Proteins of the rat prostate. II. Synthesis of new proteins in the ventral lobe during castration-induced regression.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ventral prostates from adult Sprague-Dawley rats at different days postcastration were cut into one to two mm.3 pieces and incubated in medium containing S35-methionine (100 uCi/ml.) at 37C under 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide for four hours. The incubated tissues were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis and radiofluorography. Over 100 spots were developed in the fluorograms. Three groups of spots, representing cytoskeletal proteins, androgen-dependent proteins and castration-induced proteins, were further evaluated by a computer-based densitometer. The level of densitometry absorption is proportional to the amount of radioactivity in each spot. The synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and tropomyosin, were relatively constant throughout the course of prostatic regression. The rate of synthesis of androgen-dependent proteins declined rapidly from a high level of synthesis before castration to a non-detectable level by Day 3 postcastration. However, three proteins, which were either not synthesized (spot G and spot H) or synthesized at a very low level (spot I) before castration, were the major proteins synthesized by the prostate during early stages of its regression. The rate of synthesis of these proteins reached a peak by Day 4 postcastration, declined rapidly and remained at a low level thereafter. The respective molecular weights and isoelectric points for these three proteins were 33 Kd and 7.2 for spot G, 38 Kd and 5.3 for spot H and 64 Kd and 6.0 for spot I. Previous findings showed that prostatic regression in rats was associated with a surge of activities in proteolytic enzymes which peaked five to six days postcastration. The peak of synthesis of three proteins noted in the present study, therefore, preceded the peak of activities of proteolytic enzymes in the regressing prostate by one to two days. Testosterone replacement to animals at the time of castration prevented the synthesis of these proteins in the prostate. Since the synthesis of these three proteins in the ventral prostate is induced by androgen-depletion resulted from castration, they are considered as the castration-induced proteins.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The partial dependency of human prostatic growth factor on steroid hormones in stimulating thymidine incorporation into DNA.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Growth factors stimulating DNA synthesis in mouse 3T3, human DU145, and LNCaP were partially purified from human benign hyperplastic and cancerous prostates. These factors have a high affinity for heparin sepharose and are eluted from the heparin-sepharose column, at 1.2 to 1.9 M NaCl. In normal prostates, the high affinity human prostatic growth factor occurred only in extremely small amounts. The high affinity growth factors stimulate DNA synthesis in 3T3, DU145, and LNCaP. Stimulation was significantly enhanced by 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 17 beta-estradiol in the androgen sensitive LNCaP cell line. SDS-PAGE and isoelectrofocusing confirmed that the partially purified factors had a molecular weight of 18 kDa and acidic isoelectric points of pH 3.6 and 4.7.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Experiences with bladder reconstruction in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The results in 56 children (28 with neurogenic bladder dysfunction) undergoing enterocystoplasty between 1981 and 1985 are presented. Ileal, ileocecal, right colon and sigmoid segments were used in tubular and opened configurations. Our experience leads us to recommend opened ileal segment reconstruction in neurogenic bladder patients and those with weak anal sphincters generally, and open ileocecal or open right colon segments in patients with other etiologies. Continence was achieved in 53 patients, although secondary procedures, particularly at the bladder outlet, were required in 13. When ureteral reimplantation was required we achieved excellent success with normal-sized or mildly dilated ureters regardless of the operative technique used. Initial failures to prevent reflux in the face of marked ureterectasis using the ileocecal valve have been resolved by a modified technique of intussusception and fixation. An over-all favorable experience is reported, which we believe permits us to formulate certain rules that will improve the acceptability and success of bladder reconstruction in general.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cystometric properties of ileum and right colon after bladder augmentation, substitution or replacement.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cystometric studies were performed on 38 patients who had undergone augmentation, substitution or replacement enterocystoplasty. These studies were done to determine the choice of bowel segment to augment or replace the detrusor and the shape in which the bowel segment should be reconstructed. Eleven patients underwent tubular and 10 detubularized right colon cystoplasty, while 10 underwent tubular (Camey bladder) and 7 detubularized ileocystoplasty. Compliance curves were normal in nearly all patients except those who underwent tubular ileocystoplasty. Cystoplasty contractions were more common with tubular cystoplasty. These contractions appeared at a lower bladder capacity and were higher in amplitude in tubular cystoplasty patients. Detubularizing the bowel for bladder reconstruction appears to create a better low pressure capacitor with better compliance and fewer high pressure cystoplasty contractions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gastrocystoplasty and colocystoplasty in canines: the metabolic consequences of acute saline and acid loading.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An experimental canine model was developed to quantitate the net transmural ion flux of colon and gastric segments used for augmentation cystoplasty. Gastrocystoplasty (4) or colocystoplasty (4) was constructed in 8 female mongrels. Acute intravenous saline and acid loading experiments were performed 2 to 4 weeks after cystoplasty. The mean solute excretion rates for sodium, chloride, phosphorus and ammonia exhibited opposite trends during acute saline and acid loading in this experimental model. The net flux of chloride, ammonia, phosphorus and sodium ions in the colocystoplasty animals was from the mucosa/urine surface to the serum (reabsorption). The opposite trend was true for the gastrocystoplasty. By not reabsorbing ammonium chloride, the gastrocystoplasty preserved an important renal mechanism for systemic acid elimination. This may help to prevent the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that can develop when urine comes in contact with small or large bowel segments.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Small bowel augmentation in children with neurogenic bladder: an initial report of urodynamic findings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Augmentation cystoplasty is a useful adjunct in the treatment of the neurogenic bladder. After preoperative urodynamic and clinical assessment, 10 children with neurogenic bladders underwent small bowel augmentation. Presenting clinical problems included incontinence and hydronephrosis. Urodynamic studies after small bowel augmentation demonstrated that bladder capacity increased an average of 184 per cent. Maximum intravesical pressures diminished considerably compared to preoperative values and no patient suffered significant uninhibited contractions. Nine children are totally dry and 1 has stress incontinence. Our initial findings demonstrate the efficacy of small bowel augmentation in the treatment of lower urinary tract neurogenic dysfunction owing primarily to alterations in detrusor function.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fertility in cryptorchidism: improved timing of fixation and treatment in an experimental model.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Modifications were made in an experimental model in the rat to make it more analogous to human cryptorchidism and more useful in evaluating treatment. The age of experimental bilateral cryptorchidism was changed from 3 days to 11 days. Neither group was able to father offspring. The age at orchiopexy also was modified from the range of 21 to 28 days to exactly 21 days. The ability to father offspring improved significantly (72 versus 30 per cent) and it was not significantly different from previously reported sham operated rats (84 per cent). The current experimental model demonstrates that early surgical treatment can restore fertility to mechanically cryptorchid animals. The model can be used to evaluate the effects of varying types and timing of treatment.</ABSTRACT>

- An anterior detrusor tube bladder neck reconstruction was performed in 8 girls with urogenital sinus anomalies during a 15-year period. A good or excellent result was achieved in 63 per cent of the patients. The surgical technique entails the creation of a long anteriorly based detrusor tube (6 to 7 cm.) tunneled subsymphyseal to the introitus, which provides access for clean intermittent catheterization. Augmentation cystoplasty, which was incorporated into the reconstruction in 1 case, may enhance further the success rates with this approach.</ABSTRACT>

The patients were separated into 2 main groups: classical cloacal exstrophy (type I) and variant cloacal exstrophy (type II). In the classical cases 3 surface patterns were recognized: A-hemibladders confluent cranial to the bowel, B-hemibladders lateral to the bowel and C-hemibladders confluent caudal to the bowel. Surgical reconstruction was performed in 24 patients, with a 50 per cent survival rate. However, there was marked improvement in survival from 22 per cent between 1963 and 1978 to 90 per cent between 1979 and 1986.</ABSTRACT>

- Distal penile hypospadias was repaired in 59 boys with a modification of the Mathieu technique. Since a watertight urethroplasty is performed without overlying suture lines, catheter drainage and urinary diversion may not be necessary and they were not used in any patient. Penile nerve block and a small dressing allowed for postoperative mobilization. An excellent cosmetic and functional result was achieved with few complications, even in boys who had had prior unsatisfactory repairs. Because the children are ambulatory postoperatively and tolerate voiding through the repair, this procedure often is performed on an outpatient basis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The use of parenteral testosterone therapy in genital reconstructive surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previously, testosterone cream has been used for penile enlargement before genital surgery. The results not only were inconsistent but the absorption was variable. Therefore, we elected to study the use of parenteral testosterone as an adjunct before reconstructive surgery. In 44 patients with hypospadias (36), epispadias (5) or urethral fistulas (3) 2 mg. per kg. testosterone enanthate were given intramuscularly 5 and 2 weeks before reconstructive surgery. Testosterone caused a mean increase in penile length of 2.7 cm. and in circumference of 2.3 cm. as well as local vascularity in all patients. In addition to surgical results the potential side effects of testosterone treatment were monitored 3 months to 1 year postoperatively. Basal testosterone levels were obtained in patients before and during therapy, and postoperatively. In addition, side effects, such as increased bone age and excessive pubic hair, were not a problem. The use of preoperative testosterone significantly contributed to the successful reconstruction of these patients, particularly those with a paucity of penile skin and those who had undergone previous repairs. Temporary penile stimulation by testosterone enanthate allows for an earlier penile operation as well as provides negligible side effects.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A unified approach to early reconstructive surgery of the child with ambiguous genitalia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Gender assignment in the newborn with ambiguous genitalia poses a dilemma for the parents and physician, even if the infant has a normal 46XX or 46XY karyotype. In general, female pseudohermaphrodites are reared as female subjects, since they can undergo reconstruction to appear as phenotypic female subjects and they may even be able to bear children. Male pseudohermaphrodites, patients with mixed gonadal dysgenesis and male patients with a micropenis may not be so straightforward, and proper gender assignment in these infants may be difficult. A unified surgical approach to early reconstruction of the external genitalia in these patients, who are to be reared as female subjects, has been developed. Essential to this perineal reconstruction are phallic reduction and recession in which erectile tissue is removed with preservation of the neurovascular bundles and glans, creation of labia minora from flaps of phallic skin and foreskin, a labioscrotal Y-V plasty to produce normal-appearing labia majora and construction of a neovagina with a perineal flap. If the patient is a male pseudohermaphrodite or an infant with a micropenis creation of the vagina is deferred until late adolescence or young adulthood. In other patients in whom the vagina enters the urethra or urogenital sinus proximal to the external sphincter a pullthrough vaginoplasty is performed when the child is 2 to 3 years old. If the vaginal entry is distal to the external urinary sphincter a flap vaginoplasty is performed at the same time as the phallic reduction, and creation of the labia minora and labia majora during infancy. Ten patients (4 with the adrenogenital syndrome, 2 male pseudohermaphrodites, 2 genetic male patients with a micropenis, 1 with mixed gonadal dysgenesis and 1 true hermaphrodite) have undergone reconstruction with this composite procedure. All 10 patients have had a successful cosmetic and early functional result.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The bladder mucosal graft for urethral reconstruction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Single stage repairs of a variety of congenital and acquired urethral anomalies were performed in 16 male patients with free grafts of bladder mucosa. Of the patients 10 previously had undergone unsuccessful attempts at urethral reconstruction, including 9 boys with hypospadias. Grafts ranged between 2 and 8.5 cm. long. A fistula occurred postoperatively in 1 patient and it responded to prolonged suprapubic drainage. Meatal stenosis necessitated a further operation in 1 patient. The bladder mucosal graft technique should be considered for urethral reconstruction when prior attempts at repair have failed or when the disorder is primary, and local penile or preputial skin is deficient.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Urodynamic assessment of children with cerebral palsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- More than a third of the children with cerebral palsy present with dysfunctional voiding symptoms. Clinical evaluation and urodynamic study of cerebral palsy patients were performed to characterize the symptoms, to define the type of neurological deficit and to document its effect on voiding dynamics. We evaluated flow rate, and cystometrographic and external sphincter electromyographic findings in 57 children with cerebral palsy. Upper and lower motor neuron lesions were defined by standard criteria. Of the children 86 per cent had evidence of a pure upper motor neuron injury and 11 per cent manifested electromyographic findings suggestive of incomplete lower motor neuron sphincteric injury. The latter deficit could not be predicted on the basis of clinical neurological findings but it was suggested by a history of neonatal cyanosis. Treatment protocols achieved continence in more than 75 per cent of the children. The voiding dynamics in children with cerebral palsy have not been assessed previously. We have defined the lower urinary tract dysfunction in these patients, and provide a rational and effective plan of management.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Biofeedback training for children with bladder sphincter incoordination.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied 35 children with voiding dysfunction and detrusor-sphincter incoordination. More than 90 per cent of these patients had a history of repeat urinary tract infections, and medication and surgical treatment of the voiding dysfunction had failed. Of the patients 22 (63 per cent) experienced significant improvement or resolution of the voiding dysfunction when biofeedback was used to teach normal bladder sphincter coordination as part of the over-all treatment regimen. A review of our experience with these patients indicates that with proper patient selection an even higher rate of success may be possible.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Biological response of bladders rendered continent by insertion of artificial sphincter.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Artificial sphincters were inserted in 44 children for intractable urinary incontinence. Of the patients 70 per cent achieved satisfactory continence (minimum followup 18 months) with no revisions, and 10 per cent were rendered continent with 1 revision and 10 per cent with multiple revisions. The procedure failed in 10 per cent of the patients primarily because of infection. Extensive urodynamic studies were performed at reoperation and postoperatively. Long-term urodynamic followup was available in 36 continent children. Hydronephrosis occurred in 2 per cent of the upper tracts assessed and 18 per cent of the patients had significant residual urine. Mean bladder capacity tended to increase progressively postoperatively. Mean bladder compliance also was well maintained.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A nonsurgical approach to the management of primary vesicoureteral reflux.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We performed a retrospective review to evaluate the results of a nonsurgical approach to the management of primary vesicoureteral reflux during a 10-year period (1976 to 1986). During that interval patients with reflux were studied initially with a standard voiding cystourethrogram and either an excretory urogram or a renal scan with glomerular filtration rate and/or differential renal function determination. Height, weight, blood pressure, urine cultures and serum creatinine measurements also were obtained. Isotope cystography was used for followup examinations. A single, negative isotope cystogram was the radiological criterion for cessation of reflux. The charts of 545 children (55 per cent had bilateral reflux) with 844 refluxing ureters were reviewed. Based upon the international classification vesicoureteral reflux was grade I in 6.6 per cent of the cases, grade II in 54.2 per cent, grade III in 31.6 per cent, grade IV in 5.7 per cent and grade V in 1.9 per cent. All children were kept on long-term continuous prophylactic antibiotics and they were re-evaluated annually with isotope cystography. The followup rate for the entire group was 88 per cent. During the observation period spontaneous resolution of reflux was noted in 36 per cent of the patients and 39 per cent of the total refluxing ureters. Only 13 per cent of the entire group underwent surgical correction of reflux. Presently, 39 per cent (215) of the patients continue to be followed with reflux. Of the total group 66 patients (12 per cent) were lost to followup. In the 194 patients with spontaneous resolution of reflux the mean duration of reflux was 1.69 years, with 30 to 35 per cent resolving each year. Based on Student's t test there was a significant difference in duration of reflux in patients with grade II compared to grade III reflux (1.56 versus 1.97 years, p less than 0.04). When age at presentation was compared with duration of reflux there was a significantly shorter duration of reflux only in those patients presenting from age 0 to 12 months, compared to those 13 months and older (1.44 versus 1.85 years, p less than 0.02). Renal function was evaluated by serum creatinine, calculated glomerular filtration rate or differential diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid scan results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Detrusorrhaphy: extravesical ureteral advancement to correct vesicoureteral reflux in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We used a modified extravesical technique, coined detrusorrhaphy, to correct surgically vesicoureteral reflux. By detrusorrhaphy the submucosal ureteral tunnel is opened, the ureteral meatus is advanced and anchored onto the trigone, and the detrusor buttress of the ureter is closed (-rrhaphy). The operation is performed extravesically. The procedure was used in the last 5 years in 79 children, or 120 renal units. Reflux resolved in 93 per cent of the renal units. Postoperative morbidity related to bladder spasms and hematuria was minimal compared to conventional transvesical surgical procedures. Detrusorrhaphy is an effective method to correct vesicoureteral reflux and to minimize postoperative morbidity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We treated 35 children with different grades of vesicoureteral reflux with endoscopic injection of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) behind the intravesical ureter. A total of 51 refluxing ureters was treated. In all cases absence of reflux was noted on a cystogram performed immediately after the procedure. At 3 to 12-month followup reflux was absent in 32 ureters and it recurred in 4, including 3 ureters with low grade reflux. A second injection of polytetrafluoroethylene in 3 ureters resulted in its absence, while in 1 case reimplantation was performed. The procedure is simple and reliable. An operation is avoided, hospital stay is reduced and no complications have occurred.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The endoscopic correction of reflux by polytetrafluoroethylene injection.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Endoscopic subureteral injection of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) was done in 38 patients (55 ureters) to correct vesicoureteral reflux. Followup excretory urograms and nuclear cystograms were available in 28 patients (40 ureters) 2 to 11 months after injection. Nearly 50 per cent of the patients had a neurogenic bladder. Injection was done for all grades of reflux, although the majority of cases had at least grade III reflux. After injection reflux either was eliminated or decreased in 76 per cent of the patients with neurogenic disease and in 87 per cent of those with a normally innervated bladder. This outpatient procedure is simple and brief to perform, and it is associated with minimal morbidity. As with any new antireflux technique longer followup is indicated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The dorsal lumbotomy incision in pediatric urological surgery [see comments]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between January 1, 1983 and September 30, 1985, 42 upper urinary tract operations were performed using the dorsal lumbotomy incision, representing 28 per cent of all upper tract procedures performed. Operations included pyeloplasty, partial and total nephroureterectomy, pyelolithotomy, ureterolithotomy and renal exploration with cyst marsupialization. The major contraindications to lumbotomy were malignancy and malrotated or malpositioned kidneys. Patient age ranged from 1 month to 20 years. A modification of the Gil-Vernet vertical lumbotomy incision was used in all cases. This approach involves successive incisions through the layers of the lumbodorsal fascia to gain access to the kidney and ureter, and emphasizes a muscle-retracting technique. Incision of the costovertebral ligament allows 12th rib elevation and improves the exposure obtained. There were no postoperative complications related to the lumbotomy incision itself. Decreased surgical morbidity is suggested by our results. By 3 days postoperatively 64 per cent of our patients required no analgesic medication, 93 per cent were tolerating a regular diet and 83 per cent were evaluated as having a good appetite. Mean hospital length of stay for all lumbotomy patients was 5.6 days. We conclude that the dorsal lumbotomy incision can be used to perform a wide variety of upper tract operations in children, resulting in minimal morbidity and short hospital stays.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in canine lower genitourinary tissues: insight into development and function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Radioligand receptor binding methods were used to characterize the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor in the bladder body, bladder base, prostate and urethra of the male dog. Saturation experiments were performed in tissue homogenates using [125iodine]-Heat, an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist of high specific activity (2,200 Ci. per mmol.). The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd for [125iodine]-Heat binding in the bladder body (0.56 pM.), bladder base (0.81 +/- 0.11 pM.), prostate (0.86 +/- 0.19 pM.) and urethra (0.55 pM.) was similar, suggesting homogeneity of alpha 1-adrenergic binding sites in lower genitourinary tissues. The receptor density in the bladder body, bladder base, prostate and urethra, expressed as fmol. per mg. wet weight, was 0.22 +/- 0.02, 0.82 +/- 0.09, 0.55 +/- 0.06 and 0.27 +/- 0.06, respectively (mean +/- standard error of mean). Competitive binding experiments with [125iodine]-Heat and unlabeled prazosin and clonidine confirmed the selectivity of Heat for alpha 1-adrenergic binding sites. Anatomical dissections have revealed that a major component of the smooth muscle of the bladder base and prostate originates from the ureter, whereas a major component of the smooth muscle of the urethra originates from the bladder. The measured alpha 1-adrenergic receptor densities support these developmental theories.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of cyclosporine A on male reproduction in rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We examined the effects of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A on male reproduction in sexually mature rats. The drug was administered subcutaneously in 3 doses (10, 20 and 40 mg. per kg. daily) for 14 days. Cyclosporine A administration resulted in a dose-dependent decline in body and reproductive organ weights, histology of the testis showed definite degenerative changes, and sperm counts and motility decreased. Spermatozoa from treated rats retained the cytoplasmic droplet and they were decapitated. Consequently, sterility occurred in rats treated with high doses of cyclosporine A. A reduction in circulating testosterone and an increase in gonadotropins were noted. The possibility existed that the cyclosporine A-induced alterations in the male reproductive system were secondary to the hepatic or nephrotoxic effects of the drug. Therefore, we assessed liver and kidney function by assay of the serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and creatinine. Except for an increase in bilirubin, none of the other liver function studies was altered, thereby eliminating hepatocellular damage as the etiology of impaired reproductive function in cyclosporine A-treated rats. We observed an increase in creatinine levels in animals treated with higher doses of cyclosporine A, consistent with mild renal failure. However, the fact that a decline in reproductive function was seen even in the group treated with 10 mg. per kg. cyclosporine A daily, which had normal serum creatinine levels, suggests that the alterations in male reproduction seen with this therapy are not entirely the result of nephrotoxicity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Improved patency of collagen-impregnated grafts after in vitro autogenous endothelial cell seeding.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Currently available prosthetic vascular grafts remain sufficiently thrombogenic to preclude their use as small-caliber arterial substitutes. However, thrombogenicity may be significantly reduced by the presence of an endothelial monolayer on the luminal surface. The present study was undertaken to test the efficacy of lining a small-caliber prosthesis with autogenous endothelial cells in vitro so that the graft may subsequently be implanted with an established confluent endothelial lining. For this purpose, cells were obtained from canine external jugular vein, harvested enzymatically, and passaged in culture. Dacron grafts (4 X 150 mm) were then seeded in vitro and maintained for 48 to 72 hours before implantation in the femoral position of the same animal. Seeded grafts were implanted contralateral to unseeded control grafts and explanted after 1 month. Seeded grafts demonstrated an 86% patency rate at explanation in contrast to the significantly lower 14% patency rate of the unseeded control grafts. This study justifies further investigation directed toward the feasibility of endothelializing intravascular prostheses in vitro before implantation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Late results after carotid endarterectomy for amaurosis fugax.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Amaurosis fugax is considered an ocular transient ischemic attack with an ominous prognosis. One hundred twenty-eight patients with amaurosis fugax as the presenting symptom underwent carotid endarterectomy at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Scripps Clinic between 1970 and 1985 with one death (0.8%) and one postoperative permanent stroke (0.8%). Subsequently, these patients were followed up for 6 to 160 months (mean 45.3 months). Only two subsequent late strokes were documented (at 2 and 5 years after operation). These results were significantly better (p less than 0.01) by life-table analysis than the late stroke rate after carotid endarterectomy performed to treat anterior motor transient ischemic attacks at both UCSD and Scripps Clinic, as well as the reported late follow-up for all transient ischemic attacks after carotid endarterectomy in the literature (1.8% per year, 17 publications, 1980 operations). Thus amaurosis fugax appears to be a particularly favorable indication for carotid endarterectomy. Left untreated, this event carries a high risk of stroke; after carotid endarterectomy, which has a low operative risk, there is a very low postoperative stroke rate (two strokes in 448 patient-years of follow-up).</ABSTRACT>

We have studied the detailed histology of 91 carotid atheromatous plaques with particular regard to hemorrhage and neovascularity and have confirmed the findings of earlier investigators while observing degenerative changes (not previously reported) in these new vessels. The possible role of systemic hypertension in intraplaque hemorrhage and the acceleration of the atherosclerotic process is discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long-term results of in situ and extracorporeal surgery for renovascular hypertension caused by fibrodysplasia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In this study the early and late results of surgical reconstruction for renovascular hypertension caused by fibrodysplasia are evaluated in 53 patients treated between 1962 and 1983. There were 40 female and 13 male patients. The mean blood pressure was 208/126 mm Hg before medical therapy and 171/109 mm Hg thereafter. Bilateral renal artery stenoses were present in 12 patients. In situ revascularization was used in 26 patients and extracorporeal surgery to repair branch artery lesions was performed in 27 patients. Surgical therapy reduced the blood pressure to normal levels with minimal antihypertensive medications. This effect was already apparent 6 to 12 months after operation (mean blood pressure level of 140/90 mm Hg) and it was maintained during a mean follow-up period of 8.4 years (range 1 to 20 years) (mean blood pressure level of 134/85 mm Hg). At 6 to 12 months after operation, 79% of the patients were classified as either cured or improved. At this time the results did not appear to have been influenced by the preoperative duration of hypertension, nor by manifestations of extrarenal arteriosclerosis (ERA) as found in 10 patients, or by the surgical technique applied. But at the end of the long-term follow-up period (mean 8.3 years) the beneficial response rate of 87% appeared to have been adversely influenced by the presence of preoperative ERA, since beneficial response rates were 93% for those without and 67% for those with ERA (p = 0.17). We conclude that renal revascularization is effective both early and late for the treatment of renovascular hypertension caused by fibrodysplasia and that complex renovascular obstruction can be treated effectively with extracorporeal repair.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A metropolitan experience with infrainguinal revascularization. Operative risk and late results in northeastern Ohio.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite being of fundamental importance, the late results of major arterial reconstruction rarely have been documented throughout a large metropolitan area. In this study of 932 patients entered into the computer registry of the Cleveland Vascular Society, 19 surgeons representing 13 community hospitals and referral centers in Cleveland and Akron report the intermediate-term outcome during a mean interval of 35 months after infrainguinal lower extremity revascularization performed in northeastern Ohio from 1978 through 1982. Operative risk (5%), the early amputation rate (7%), and actuarial 5-year survival (48% to 55%) for patients with rest pain or tissue necrosis were significantly worse (p less than 0.05) than comparable figures (0.6%, 0%, and 77%, respectively) for others who underwent procedures for disabling claudication. Although both materials had similar success above the knee, the cumulative 3-year patency rate of autogenous vein bypass to the distal popliteal (69% to 88%; p less than 0.05) and tibioperoneal arteries (43%; 0.05 less than p less than 0.1) was superior to the results of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (32% to 50% and 19%, respectively). Moreover, polytetrafluoroethylene grafts required reoperations at three times the rate of vein grafts to maintain limb salvage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Local thrombolysis in peripheral arteries and bypass grafts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sixty-two patients hospitalized for recent angiographically documented arterial occlusion in the legs (46 femoropopliteal arteries and 16 grafts) benefited from local fibrinolytic therapy delivered at the site of the occlusion with a No. 4F or No. 5F catheter. This therapy combined a continuous urokinase (UK) infusion of 1000 U/kg/hr and a lysyl plasminogen (LYS-PLG) infusion of 15 mukat every 30 minutes. Angiographically confirmed lysis was obtained in 77% of the cases. Five percent of the patients had major and 8% had minor groin hematomas. Only two patients had concentrations of fibrinogen as low as 100 mg/dl. Intravascular infusion of UK and LYS-PLG is as effective as streptokinase but produces lower systemic fibrinolysis. However, local fibrinolysis remains a potentially hazardous procedure (10% suffered major complications) and must only be applied to patients with severe ischemia and little or no possibility of surgical intervention.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Paraplegia in the rat induced by aortic cross-clamping: model characterization and glucose exacerbation of neurologic deficit.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Spinal cord damage caused by ischemia is a serious, underappreciated, and relatively refractory problem in clinical practice. Research is hampered by a lack of experimental models that appropriately mimic clinical situations. A new model of paraplegia in the rat is presented and evaluated by standard neurologic deficit scoring (1, 4, 18, and 24 hours after occlusion) and by computerized activity monitoring (1 and 18 hours after occlusion). Rats underwent temporary occlusion of the thoracic aorta for 10, 15, or 20 minutes. Experimental groups received glucose (2 gm/kg) and demonstrated a significant elevation in blood glucose (p = 0.001) and were significantly more neurologically impaired at all four time periods (p less than or equal to 0.005) than the ischemic control group, which received equivalent volumes of normal saline solution. Significant differences in neurologic deficit were noted with direct clinical examination and computerized activity monitoring. With the use of the latter system, statistical differences were detected in total distance traveled and number of vertical movements. We conclude the following: (1) Paraplegia is reliably and reproducibly achieved in this rat model; (2) because of the rat's more extensive behavioral repertoire when compared with other models of spinal ischemia (e.g., rabbit), more end points can be monitored and more subtle behavioral deficits discerned; (3) computerized activity monitoring can distinguish varying degrees of neurologic deficit and correlates with clinical neurologic deficit scoring; and (4) glucose exacerbates paraplegia in this model.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Carotid endarterectomy, siphon stenosis, collateral hemispheric pressure, and perioperative cerebral infarction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine whether moderate stenosis (50% to 80%) of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery increases the risk of cerebral infarction after carotid endarterectomy, the arteriograms, ocular pneumoplethysmograms, internal carotid back pressure, and clinical outcome after 169 operations were reviewed. Siphon stenoses less than 50% were not included because of their doubtful anatomic and hemodynamic significance. No patients with stenosis greater than 80% underwent operation. Moderate siphon stenosis affected 37 vessels, 24 (14.2%) ipsilateral and 13 (7.6%) contralateral to the side of operation. Eight patients had bilateral siphon stenosis. Three patients had stroke after operation; none of these cases had siphon stenosis. Moderate siphon stenosis did not increase the risk of perioperative cerebral infarction. Stroke only occurred in those patients in whom there was arteriographic or functional evidence that the affected hemisphere was isolated from effective collateral vessels.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- To select topics for quality assurance activities focusing on older patients, we convened a 14-member panel of physicians and experts in quality assurance. In two rounds of ratings, panelists rated 42 medical conditions (eg, pneumonia) in terms of their effects on patient outcomes, the availability of beneficial interventions, and the health benefits from improving current quality. They rated 27 health services (eg, adult day-care) on similar dimensions. The feasibility of doing quality assurance work on each condition and service also was rated. Using the ratings, the conditions selected for quality assurance work were congestive heart failure, hypertension, pneumonia, breast cancer, adverse effects of drugs, incontinence, and depression. Health care services selected were hospital discharge planning, acute inpatient care for the frail elderly, long-term-care facilities (intermediate-care facilities and skilled nursing facilities), home health care services, and case management.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The yield of routinely performed annual panels of laboratory tests was examined among patients in the skilled nursing facility section of a large, multilevel, long-term-care institution. Of 9270 tests done as part of 336 annual panels in 121 patients over an eight-year period, 17% of the tests yielded abnormal results, and in 36% of the tests, abnormal results were new. Among the 336 panels, 56 (16.7%) had at least one abnormality that was believed to have resulted in some benefit to 30 (24.7%) of the patients. Many of the abnormalities that led to patient benefit could have been detected by periodic monitoring of chronic conditions and their treatment as opposed to true screening tests, and all such abnormalities could have been identified by a complete blood cell count, electrolyte determinations, renal and thyroid function tests, and a urinalysis. The results suggest that a modest panel of annual laboratory tests could limit the potential costs of screening and not result in the loss of potential benefits to patients in skilled nursing facilities.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Coagulopathy caused by vitamin K deficiency in critically ill, hospitalized patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency was discovered in 42 hospitalized patients, most of whom had been misdiagnosed as having disseminated intravascular coagulation. Factors contributing to vitamin deficiency included inadequate diet, malabsorption, failure of physicians to prescribe vitamin K supplements, antibiotic therapy, renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, recent major surgery, and possibly pregnancy. Sixteen patients (34%) bled sufficiently to need red blood cell transfusions and ten patients (24%) ultimately died. Of 18 patients who also had thrombocytopenia, three did have disseminated intravascular coagulation. The deficiency, a contributor to morbidity and mortality, can be prevented by prophylactic administration of vitamin K to severely ill patients who are eating inadequately and receiving antibiotics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physician referrals in a competitive environment. An estimate of the economic impact of a referral.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Beyond offering optimum care for individual patients, physician referrals have a cumulative economic impact on many components of the broader medical care system. This article offers an approximation of the magnitude of that impact. By retrospectively reviewing financial records associated with 225 referrals from fee-for-service, rural family practice sites to university-based specialist colleagues, we found that the average referral generated $2944 in combined hospital charges and professional fees within a six-month period after referral. Almost half (110/225, or 49%) of those referrals resulted in a hospital admission and 72% of all revenue associated with referral accrued to the hospital. A second and more detailed study of 97 referrals showed that only 18% of total revenue resulting from referrals accrued to the physician to which the patient was initially referred. We argue that control over volume and destination of referrals, historically the referring physician's prerogative, is susceptible to change in our rapidly restructuring medical care system. In the future, no economic entity that benefits from physician referrals should take for granted those referrals or their impact.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dipstick leukocyte esterase activity in first-catch urine specimens. A useful screening test for detecting sexually transmitted disease in the adolescent male.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although sexually active female adolescents are often routinely screened for sexually transmitted diseases, indications for culturing adolescent males for sexually transmitted urethral infections are controversial. A study of 54 sexually active males (14 to 22 years old) was undertaken to assess the reliability of using dipstick leukocyte esterase activity in first-catch urine specimens to detect urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Eighteen males had sexually transmitted diseases: N gonorrhoeae (nine patients), C trachomatis (eight patients), and N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (one patient). First-catch urine specimens with a 1+ (mild) or 2+ (moderate) reaction on dipstick testing had a leukocyte (WBC) count of 10 WBCs per high-power field or greater on microscopic analysis, with an 83% sensitivity, 100% specificity, a 100% positive predictive value, and a 92% negative predictive value for the presence of N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, or both. Clinical criteria for screening (urethral discharge, dysuria, or exposure to a sexually transmitted infection) plus a dipstick-positive first-catch urine specimen had a 94% sensitivity, 89% specificity, an 81% positive predictive value, and a 97% negative predictive value.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pregnancy and birth rates among sexually experienced US teenagers--1974, 1980, and 1983.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We examined pregnancy rates and birth rates among United States teenagers aged 15 to 19 years in 1974, 1980, and 1983. Pregnancy rate refers to live births plus induced abortions per 1000 women; birth rate refers to live births per 1000 women. We present these rates for all teens aged 15 to 19 years and for teens aged 15 to 19 years who were sexually experienced. Data sources included National Center for Health Statistics birth records, Centers for Disease Control abortion surveillance reports, and Bureau of the Census population estimates. Sexual experience estimates came from national surveys of adolescent sexual behavior. Between 1974 and 1980, the pregnancy rate among all teens increased; the pregnancy rate among sexually experienced teens declined. From 1980 to 1983, the pregnancy rate declined among all teens and among sexually experienced teens. Birth rates among US teenagers (all teens and sexually experienced teens) declined between 1974 and 1983. Whereas the decline in the birth rate from 1974 to 1980 was primarily due to increased use of abortion, the decline from 1980 to 1983 related to the decrease in teenage pregnancies.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Perspectives on adolescent substance use. A defined population study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We asked 1447 tenth graders to complete a survey on physical activity, nutrition, stress, and substance use and to undergo basic physical assessments. In a multiple regression analysis, increased level of substance use by both boys and girls was most strongly predicted by friends' marijuana use. For boys, this was followed by perceived safety of cigarette smoking; poor school performance; parents' education; and use of diet pills, laxatives, or diuretics for weight control, accounting for 44% of the overall variation in substance use. For girls, friends' marijuana use was followed by poor school performance; self-induced vomiting for weight control; perceived safety of cigarette smoking; use of diet pills, laxatives, or diuretics for weight control; parents' education; perceived adult attitudes about cigarettes; and nonuse of seat belts, accounting for 53% of the overall variance. Separate multiple regression analyses for each substance produced similar results. The homogeneity of the study population precluded ethnic comparisons. These findings suggest that for many purposes substance use may be considered a single behavior regardless of the specific substance(s) used and that substance use may exist as part of a syndrome of adolescent problem behaviors. In addition, the potent influence of perceived social environment suggests that a social influence resistance model may represent the most successful preventive strategy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of alcohol on nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of 120 mL (4 oz) of scotch whiskey (40% alcohol) on nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux was studied by ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. Seventeen healthy volunteers were studied on two occasions, using a computerized radiotelemetric esophageal pH monitoring system. The subjects were given the alcohol during the second session, three hours after the evening meal, and went to bed at their usual time. Seven of the 17 subjects had prolonged supine reflux episodes on the night of alcohol ingestion. These lasted an average of 47.1 minutes (23.2 to 91.8 minutes) and occurred on an average of 3 1/2 hours after ingestion of whiskey and 1.4 hours after lying down. None of the subjects had these episodes on the control night. There was also a significant acidic shift in the cumulative percentage of data points below a pH of 3 and a pH of 4 in the supine position on the night of alcohol ingestion compared with the control night. This study has shown that there was a significant exposure of the distal esophagus to acid and that the normal acid clearance of the esophagus in the supine position was impaired after only moderate amounts of alcohol.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Health and economic implications of a tobacco-free society.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cigarette smoking causes more premature deaths than do all the following together: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, fire, automobile accidents, homicide, and suicide. Attainment of a tobacco-free society ultimately would produce a national life-expectancy gain comparable with that that would accompany the complete elimination of all cancers not caused by tobacco use. In particular, each year 350,000 individuals who would have experienced tobacco-related deaths would realize a life-expectancy gain of 15 years. Reflecting their higher smoking prevalence and rates of smoking-related diseases, blacks would benefit more than whites. By altering the mix of morbid conditions and fatal diseases, the end of tobacco-related diseases would shift the need for particular medical specialties and health care facilities. The tobacco industry implies that the demise of tobacco consumption would wreak havoc with the economy. By contrast, some antitobacco activists suggest that the end of tobacco use would yield a multibillion dollar fiscal dividend. Each argument is fundamentally flawed. The economic impacts of a tobacco-free society would be modest and of far less consequence than the principal implication: a significantly enriched quality and quantity of life.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Predicting nutrition-associated complications for patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied 202 patients admitted to two major teaching hospitals for planned gastrointestinal surgery to assess the ability of several techniques of nutritional assessment to predict major postoperative complications (infection and/or wound problems). Subjective global assessment (SGA) and albumin were both of predictive value, and combinations of these variables were useful in differentiating low-risk from high-risk patients. Transferrin, creatinine-height index, percent ideal weight, percent body fat, and total lymphocyte count were not useful in predicting complications. We conclude that SGA and albumin are useful "nutritional assessment techniques" for patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery if the purpose of such an assessment is to predict postoperative "nutrition-associated complications." The second major finding of this study was the unexpectedly low rate of complications (10%) which was found in both hospitals. We suggest that these low complication rates may be more generalizable to patient populations derived from a wide community base, rather than those described in other studies in which veterans or patients of lower socioeconomic status comprised the sample.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Dislodgement of Hickman, Broviac, and Mediport catheters is a rare but recognized complication. To date, no specific etiology for this has been cited. We present five cases of dislodgement due to positional changes in large-breasted women and one man with gynecomastia. Apparently, motion in the subcutaneous tissue secondary to gravitational forces on large breasts causes downward and outward traction on the subcutaneous portion of the catheter. Variations in placement technique to help avoid this complication are described.</ABSTRACT>

Since this method permits direct tapping of the subclavian vein and control of the insertion to the innominate vein under ultrasonic guidance, complications such as pneumothorax, accidental subclavian artery puncture, and malposition of the catheter, which often accompany the conventional method, can be avoided. As a result, this technique produces no radiation damage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A method to prevent unintentional removal of a Hickman catheter.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Many patients benefit from the use of tunneled Dacron-cuffed central venous catheters. Operative insertion with the aid of fluoroscopy is required for the proper placement of these devices. Perioperative unintentional removal of the catheter is a reported complication. The outward migration of the device occurs before adequate tissue ingrowth into the Dacron cuff has taken place. The frequency with which this unfavorable outcome occurs can be reduced by placement of a subcutaneous absorbable restraining suture distal to the Dacron cuff during the insertion procedure. The authors advocate the routine use of this adjunctive measure for the insertion of all Dacron-cuffed caval catheters.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chronic renal failure after nephrotoxic nephritis in rats: contributions to progression.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In rats dietary protein restriction decreases the rate of progressive glomerulosclerosis and the development of renal failure after subtotal nephrectomies. The present experiments were designed to see whether dietary protein had similar effects on renal failure after nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN). Groups of rats were fed isocaloric diets containing 8%, 18% and 78% casein. Irrespective of whether the diets were introduced 7 days or 30 days after induction of nephritis by a single injection of rabbit anti-rat nephrotoxic globulin, rats on 8% casein and 78% casein had significantly lower plasma creatinines than rats fed with 18% casein. Semiquantitative scoring systems were used to assess glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and tubular calcification. Rats on 8% protein had significantly lower glomerular sclerosis scores than the other two groups. Tubular atrophy scores were similar in rats on 8% and 78% casein and significantly lower than those of rats on 18% casein. All rats on 8% and 18% casein diets had tubular calcification whereas rats on 78% casein did not. This suggested that the normal relation between glomerular sclerosis and tubular atrophy after NTN was altered by a 78% casein diet. This was confirmed by the slopes of the regression equation for glomerular sclerosis on tubular atrophy (0.54 +/- 0.07) for rats on 78% casein compared to the slopes of the regression equations for the other two groups which were 1.12 +/- 0.10 and 1.00 +/- 0.12, respectively. This difference is highly significant statistically, P less than 0.1 X 10(-5) (one-way analysis of variance). These results show that dietary protein has a variable effect on the development of renal failure after nephrotoxic nephritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prostaglandin-E2 receptors in the rat kidney: biochemical characterization and localization.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A radiohistochemical technique yielding data on the distribution and characteristics of PGE2-receptor binding in tissue sections is described. The binding of tritiated PGE2 (3H-PGE2) to slide-mounted tissue sections had all the characteristics associated with ligand-receptor interactions: it was saturable, of high affinity and displayed high specificity for PGE2 binding. From the binding curves a Hill coefficient of 1.1 was calculated which suggests the presence of a homogeneous receptor population. Pretreatment with indomethacin for four days resulted in a 66% increase in maximal binding capacity (Bmax) without any change in affinity. The distribution of receptor was mapped in rats with and without indomethacin pretreatment and compared to the distribution of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, a specific marker for the thick ascending limb of Henle. In both groups the PGE2 receptor showed striking regional variation. In the untreated group the distribution of PGE2 receptors was similar to that of the thick ascending limb of Henle, with maximal density in the outer medullary zone. After indomethacin pretreatment, however, a striking increase in inner medullary binding was observed together with increased binding in the cortex. Thus, in accordance with the main action of PGE2 being regulation of renal water and sodium excretion, we found the highest receptor density in areas of the kidney dominated by the thick ascending limb of Henle and collecting tubules, and much less binding to glomeruli and cortical vessels. In order to investigate characteristics and distribution of PGE2 receptor binding, however, it was mandatory that endogenous prostanoid synthesis is blocked.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Viscoelastic properties of tubule basement membranes in experimental renal cystic disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hereditary and acquired renal cysts develop from tubule segments that enlarge progressively. We measured the deformability of basement membranes surrounding individual normal tubules and cysts to determine if cysts might develop by simple extension of abnormally-deformable basement membrane in response to normal or increased transtubule hydrostatic pressures. Deformability (cm/dyne) was measured in individual tubules and cysts in vitro by a micropipet aspiration technique that related negative pressures within the pipet to the distance the tubule or cyst wall was aspirated into the pipet. Viscoelastic creep was determined from the time-dependent effect of pipet aspiration on membrane deformation. Proximal and collecting tubules, glomerular capsules and cysts were microdissected from controls and animals with acquired (Diphenylthiazole [rats]. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid [rats]), hereditary (C57 BL/6J [cpk/cpk] mice) and spontaneous (CFWw mice) renal cystic diseases. The major resistance to deformation was localized to the basement membrane since collagenase destroyed the elasticity of tubule and cyst walls. Tubule basement membranes adjacent to cysts appeared abnormal by electron microscopy in the animals fed DPT, but measurements of deformability and viscoelastic creep showed no differences between normal and cystic tubules in any animal model. Deformability values of cysts (7.7 +/- 1.1, 10.9 +/- 1.1, 11.2 +/- 0.6, 9.4 +/- 0.8 X 10(-3) cm/dyne in DPT, NDGA, C57 BL/6J and CFWw, respectively) are consistent with the interpretation that high transtubule pressures ranging from 39 to 134 cm H2O would be required if cysts form by simple stretching of the basement membrane secondary to a transepithelial hydrostatic pressure-gradient. Since in vivo measurements of hydrostatic pressures across cyst walls are not high enough we conclude that cysts do not enlarge due to increased deformability of tubule basement membranes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mechanism of furosemide resistance in analbuminemic rats and hypoalbuminemic patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To elucidate the mechanism of resistance of hypoalbuminemic patients to furosemide, the effect of this diuretic on urine volume of normal and analbuminemic rats (NAR) and of hypoalbuminemic patients was studied. Intravenous administration of furosemide rapidly enhanced sodium diuresis in normal rats but not in NAR. Total plasma clearance and distribution volume of furosemide were much larger in NAR than in normal rats, while no significant difference in these pharmacokinetic parameters was observed for the unbound fraction of the diuretic between the two animal groups. In contrast, urinary secretion of furosemide was significantly lower in NAR than in normal rats. Injected furosemide bound to albumin markedly promoted diuresis in NAR, while the same dose of albumin alone had no effect, indicating that binding to albumin is essential for the delivery of furosemide to the kidney, the site for its action. Injection of the complex rapidly increased the urine volume of hypoalbuminemic patients who showed a marked resistance to this diuretic. Thus, the resistance to furosemide in both NAR and hypoalbuminemic patients may be explained on the same basis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors and endorgan response in experimental aluminium intoxication.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Severe aluminium-induced osteomalacia is refractory to treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 which frequently causes hypercalcemia. To further explore the mechanisms involved, we have utilized a model of short-term aluminium intoxication in the rat (total: 11 mg elemental aluminium in 3 weeks) to study (a) 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor status in a variety of classical and non-classical target organs for 1,25(OH)2D3; (b) circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 levels; (c) baseline duodenal calcium transport, utilising the Ussing chamber, to investigate the functional significance of receptor status in a classical target organ; and (d) duodenal calcium transport response to exogenously administered 1,25(OH)2D3. Both in the three week model and in the 16 week model (total: 41 mg elemental calcium) increased maximal specific binding capacity for 1,25(OH)2D3 (Nmax), that is, number of unoccupied receptors, was observed in nuclear fractions of all tissues studied. Receptor affinity, the apparent dissociation constant KD, was unchanged. Total binding capacity, measured after displacement of endogenous ligand by Mersalyl, that is, the sum of occupied plus non-occupied receptors, was also increased. Both circulating 1,25(OH)2D3, mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux (Jms) and net calcium flux (Jnet) were reduced under baseline conditions, suggesting the lack of a direct relationship between receptor expression and endorgan response. Following exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 administration, calcium Jms and Jnet were significantly lower in the aluminium intoxicated animals, with the increment induced in Jnet in aluminium intoxicated animals being 63% of that induced in controls. Our data suggest that resistance to the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 in aluminium intoxication is postreceptor in nature.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tubuloglomerular feedback in animals with unilateral, partial ureteral occlusion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous experiments have shown that the sensitivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback system (TGF) is reduced by volume expansion in normal rats. This reduction in sensitivity is probably mediated by changes in the renal interstitial pressure. The present study was designed to investigate the TGF control system during volume expansion in rats with chronic, partial ureteral occlusion--hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis was induced on the left or right side according to the method described by Ulm and Miller, in weanling Sprague-Dawley rats three weeks old. Three to six weeks later the rats were prepared for whole kidney and micropuncture experiments. Sham-operated animals were used as controls. Net interstitial pressure (that is, interstitial hydrostatic pressure minus interstitial oncotic pressure) was higher in the hydronephrotic, volume expanded animals than in the volume expanded controls. From findings in earlier investigations this increase in interstitial pressure would have been expected to reduce TGF sensitivity but this sensitivity was increased in the hydronephrotic kidneys, as indicated by a reduction in the turning point, the tubular flow rate at which 50% of the maximal stop-flow pressure response was observed (14.4 nl/min, sham-operated control 33.4 nl/min). Strong activity of the TGF mechanism was also indicated by a large proximal-distal difference in the single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (11.9 nl/min versus 3.3 nl/min in sham-operated controls) in the hydronephrotic kidney during volume expansion. Thus, in hydronephrotic kidneys in the latter condition the TGF mechanism was highly sensitive and activated to reduce the glomerular filtration rate. This mechanism may protect the diseased kidney from high intrapelvic pressures which otherwise could damage the kidney during saline volume expansion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The kinetics of ultrafiltration during peritoneal dialysis: the role of lymphatics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Net ultrafiltration was measured directly during hypertonic peritoneal dialysis exchanges in rats. Simultaneously, lymphatic absorption was measured by monitoring the disappearance of albumin in the instilled dialysis solution from the peritoneal cavity. The albumin method for measuring lymphatic absorption was also tested in rats absorbing Lactated Ringer's solution from the peritoneal cavity where absorption rate could also be measured directly. The findings suggest the following: 1.) lymphatic absorption rate is similar with both hypertonic dialysis solutions and Lactated Ringer's solution; 2.) lymphatic absorption is substantial and net ultrafiltration is well below true transcapillary ultrafiltration; and 3.) in our model, lymphatic absorption occurs at a relatively constant rate over six hours of dwell time.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Renal anaphylaxis. I. Antigen-initiated responses from isolated perfused rat kidney.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Isolated perfused rat kidneys were passively sensitized by addition of either mouse ascitic fluid containing monoclonal IgE against dinitrophenol (DNP) or DNP-specific purified IgE. After washing the organ, defined doses of DNP-bovine serum albumin were given as bolus injection via the kidney artery. Antigen challenge of IgE-sensitized kidneys resulted in a dose-dependent increase of perfusion pressure starting with 5 micrograms antigen (2.46 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and reaching a maximum at dose higher than 100 micrograms (10.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg) (N = 4, means +/- 1 SD). A decrease of glomerular filtration rate was also observed which reached a plateau at 100 micrograms antigen (-68.5 +/- 2.9%) (N = 4). Regardless of the dose of antigen used, the urinary protein excretion markedly increased for the first five minutes following antigen injection and returned to basal values after 10 minutes. The total amounts of histamine, PGE2 and paf-acether (platelet-activating factor) released upon antigen challenge (1 mg) for 15 minutes reached maximal values of 405 +/- 21.1 ng, 286 +/- 19.4 pg and 12.3 +/- 3.2 ng (N = 5), respectively. None of these hemodynamic and biochemical effects were observed using IgG1 monoclonal antibodies or when the ascitic fluid containing monoclonal IgE used to sensitize the organ was heated at 56 degrees C for two hours. Thus, we have described a pure IgE-dependent rat kidney anaphylaxis. Antigen challenge markedly altered renal parameters and triggered the release of various mediators from the organ, suggesting that type I-hypersensitivity reactions may play a role in renal pathophysiology.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The present studies were done to determine the effect on GFR of acute volume expansion (AVE) using solutions of various sodium salts and to explore if degree of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) activation plays a role in any GFR differences. Free-flow micropuncture and inulin clearance studies were combined to investigate anesthetized Munich-Wistar rats expanded to 10% body weight with isotonic solutions of NaCl, Ringers bicarbonate (RB), NaHCO3, Na acetate (NaAc) and Na2SO4 as well as euvolemic controls. In the clearance studies, AVE yielded per gram kidney weight GFR's greater than control (1009 +/- 51 microliter/min) in the NaCl and RB (chloride expanded) groups (1397 +/- 89 and 1389 +/- 64) microliter/min, respectively, P less than 0.05 vs. control) but not in the NaHCO3, NaAc, and Na2SO4 (non-chloride expanded) groups. Proximal minus distal single nephron GFR determinations (P-D), an estimate of the degree of TGF, were less than control 13.2 +/- 2.1 nl/min) in the NaCl and RB groups (4.1 +/- 0.7 and 5.3 +/- 1.9 nl/min, respectively, P less than 0.05 vs. control) but were not significantly different from control in any of the non-chloride expanded groups. Early distal (ED) fluid flow correlated positively with P-D in all groups. ED chloride concentration but not TCO2 nor osmolality correlated with P-D for all groups. The correlation was negative for control and chloride expanded groups and positive for non-chloride expanded groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Glomerular hemodynamics in mercury-induced acute renal failure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- As manifest by tubular collapse and the virtual absence of flow into the glomerulotubular junction (GTJ), filtration in most nephrons (SNGFR) of rats poisoned with 9 mg/kg body wt HgCl2 16 to 28 hours earlier was virtually absent. Arterial colloid osmotic pressure (COPA) and Bowman's space pressure (PBS) were modestly depressed (P less than 0.05 or below), and mean blood pressure was reduced from 115 +/- 2 mm Hg (SEM) to 97 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). Glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure (Pg), 25.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg was some 24 mm Hg lower than control (P less than 0.001) and yielded a net afferent effective filtration pressure (Pnet) of 4.1 +/- 1.2 mm Hg. Excluding three rats with values greater than 10 mm Hg, Pnet averaged 2.0 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (N = 17 rats) versus 20.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg in controls (N = 10, P less than 0.001), the former being statistically almost indistinguishable from 0 mm Hg and barely able to support any filtration. This decrease in Pg was caused by a major increase in preglomerular resistance (RA) and a reciprocal fall in efferent arteriolar resistance (RE), the RA/RE ratio of 7.2 +/- 0.8 being fourfold higher than control (P less than 0.001). Renocortical blood flow was not different from control (P greater than 0.2). A wide spread of Pg values in individual glomeruli and the absence of tubular flow despite the appearance of i.v. injected lissamine green in a quadrant of surface glomeruli suggested the possibility of a greatly increased, glomerular capillary resistance. It is concluded that reciprocal changes in RA and RE are the immediate cause of filtration failure in this form of ARF and that, in the virtual absence of filtration, tubular leakage can play no important role. Since PBS was depressed in both the developmental and established phases of ARF, tubular obstruction appears to play no direct role in the pathogenesis of this particular model of murine acute renal failure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A kinetic study of cation transport in erythrocytes from uremic patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We previously described in red blood cells (RBCs) from uremic patients on dialysis a reduction in sodium (Na) efflux through the Na, potassium (K) cotransport system (Na,K CoT) while Na efflux through the Na,K pump was normal. We then examined Na efflux in fresh cells and in cells loaded to obtain one level of intracellular sodium (Nai) concentration at about 25 mmol/liter cell. In the present study we used similar cation flux methodology to examine the kinetics of cation efflux through the Na,K pump and Na,K CoT in uremic patients on dialysis. RBCs were Na-loaded to attain five different levels of Nai concentration over a range of 5 to 50 mmol/liter cells using the ionophore nystatin. At each level of Na-loading, the Nai achieved was similar in RBCs from controls and patients. Ouabain-sensitive Na efflux through the Na,K pump showed no difference in rate between normals and dialysis patients. When the kinetic parameters of this transport pathway were considered, the apparent affinity (K0.5) for sodium was not significantly different between controls and patients (18.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 20.0 +/- 2.6 mmol/liter cell) and the maximal velocity of efflux (Vmax) was also not different between controls and patients (9.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.5 +/- 1.2 mmol/liter cell/hr). Comparison of Nai-activated Na versus K efflux rates through the Na,K CoT in normal subjects demonstrated similar saturation kinetics, (K0.5 15.8 +/- 3.3 vs. 12.2 +/- 2.8 mmol/liter cell, Vmax 0.81 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter cell/hr) consistent with the known stoichiometric ratio of 1 Na:1 K:2 Cl described for this mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Morphometric aspects of reflux nephropathy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have studied the relationships between renal size, glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis and renal function in adults with reflux nephropathy. A digitizer was used to measure the renal surface areas in intravenous pyelogram films. This was then corrected for patient size by dividing by the area of the first three lumbar vertebrae. In renal biopsies, glomerular surface area and the proportion of segmentally and globally sclerosed glomeruli were measured and compared with a control group of 17 renal donors. Of 57 patients studied, 45 had intravenous pyelogram films and 32 had renal biopsy tissue available from the time of presentation, 20 had both. Thirty-one were followed for two years or more (median 6 years, range 2 to 11 years). There were positive correlations between corrected renal size and renal function, and inverse correlations between these and maximum glomerular size, the proportion of sclerosed glomeruli and vascular wall thickness. Proteinuria correlated best with the proportion of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli. As a prognostic guide, the strongest correlations were between rate of functional decline and percent segmental sclerosis, urine protein excretion and creatinine clearance at presentation. These studies confirm expected relationships between renal size, glomerular size and renal function and suggest that the severity of segmental sclerosis is a major factor in eventual decline into renal failure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of dialysate composition on intercompartmental fluid shift.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Effect of dialysate composition on intercompartmental fluid shift and hemodynamics was studied in 12 patients during 1.5 or 2 hours of hemodialysis without net ultrafiltration, using high (H;Na 154 mmol/liter), normal (N;Na 140 mmol/liter) or low (L:Na 126 mmol/liter) concentration dialysate. H dialysate was associated with a small (0.9%) increase in blood volume, a larger increase in plasma volume and a decrease in erythrocyte volume. L dialysate resulted in a 2.3% decrease in blood volume, a larger decrease in plasma volume and an increase in erythrocyte volume. N dialysate gave results which were intermediately between the other two dialysis conditions. There was no difference in the post-dialysis mean arterial pressure between the groups, although heart rate increased more during H dialysis than during the other two conditions. Change in blood and erythrocyte volume correlated significantly with change in plasma Na concentration and osmolality, but not with change in plasma urea concentration. We conclude that dialysate composition affects the movement of water into and out of the plasma and erythrocytes in a manner that can be accounted for by altered plasma concentrations of osmotically active substances.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The prognosis of segmental glomerulonephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Severe segmental glomerulonephritis (Seg GN) (greater than or equal to 50% involvement) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is classified as diffuse GN (DPGN) in the WHO classification. We tested the validity of the assumption that severe Seg GN and DPGN have the same prognosis by determining the proportion of glomeruli involved by active segmental inflammation in a series of 127 patients and by comparing the prognosis in various categories of Seg GN with patients with DPGN. In Seg GN we found mild involvement (1 to 19%) in 19 patients, moderate involvement (20 to 49%) in 9 patients and severe involvement (greater than or equal to 50%) in 17 patients. There were 28 cases of DPGN. The actuarial five-year survival of patients with mild and moderate Seg GN was 82%. The survival of patients with severe Seg GN and DPGN were 59 and 53%, respectively. The incidence of adverse outcomes, including death, end-stage kidney disease, and deterioration of renal function was similar in patients with severe Seg GN and DPGN, and greater than in patients with mild and moderate Seg GN. Although there was a trend associating increasing glomerular involvement with elevated urinary protein excretion and serum creatinine and decreased serum C3 and C4, the differences were not significant. Cumulative prednisone dose and prednisone given in the first and second years following biopsy were not different in the various categories of Seg GN and DPGN, suggesting that differences in outcome were not related to the amount of prednisone therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cellular and non-cellular compositions of crescents in human glomerulonephritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The composition of glomerular crescents was examined on the frozen kidney sections obtained from 10 patients (5 patients with IgA nephropathy, two with Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis and three with glomerulonephritis due to undetermined etiology) using well-defined monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to coagulation proteins, extracellular matrices, intermediate filament proteins and immune cells. Fibrinogen/fibrin related antigens (FRA), which were stained with anti-fibrinogen serum, were positive in the crescents of all the patients, but monoclonal antibody to crosslinked fibrin or von Willebrand factor (factor VIII related) antigen did not bind to the crescents. This suggests that the FRA deposited in the crescents is fibrinogen or its degradation products rather than fibrin. Staining for intrinsic components of renal basement membrane, including type IV and V collagens, laminin and fibronectin, were consistently positive in all stages of the crescents. Cytokeratin, showing cytoplasmic staining of the glomerular parietal epithelium and tubular epithelium in the normal kidney, was demonstrated in three patients with cellular crescents. Vimentin, which is normally distributed in parietal and visceral epithelial cells in the glomeruli and interstitial cells, was found at all stages of the crescents. These findings suggest that in the early stage of crescent formation, glomerular epithelial cells play an important role, and that the accumulation of intrinsic basement membrane constituents is associated with the formation and progression of the crescents. None of the crescent cells reacted with either of two monoclonal antibodies (Mo2 and FMC 32) to monocytes/macrophages or with nonspecific esterase staining. It seems that, at least in our patients, monocytes are a minor factor contributing to the formation of glomerular crescents.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Childhood problem behavior and neuropsychological functioning in persons at risk for alcoholism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relationship of childhood hyperkinetic and minimal brain dysfunction (Hk-MBD) to neuropsychological functioning was examined in three groups of young adults. Nonalcoholic offspring of an alcoholic parent (N = 21) and of nonalcoholic parents (N = 21) were examined. A comparison group of similar age alcoholic patients (N = 21) was also studied. Each subject completed a battery of neuropsychological test measures and was administered a checklist on the presence of Hk-MBD symptoms in childhood. Offspring of an alcoholic parent and offspring of nonalcoholic parents could not be distinguished on the basis of their cognitive abilities or their frequency of reported Hk-MBD symptoms in childhood. Alcoholic subjects performed more poorly on measures of verbal and performance intelligence and reported a higher frequency of childhood Hk-MBD symptoms. Further, it was found that the frequency of childhood Hk-MBD symptoms was related to poor performance on certain types of cognitive tasks, regardless of group membership. These findings do not support the suggestion that certain cognitive deficits distinguish persons with a family history for alcoholism. However, poor neuropsychological performance in adulthood, at least on certain types of tasks, appears to be associated with the presence of childhood Hk-MBD.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Relationship between sex-role behaviors and alcohol consumption in undergraduate men and women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relationship between sex-typed behaviors and alcohol consumption is examined in a questionnaire study involving male and female undergraduates. A multiple regression analysis indicated that for women, feminine behavior was significantly negatively correlated with total alcohol, beer and distilled spirits consumption. Weight was positively correlated with total alcohol and wine consumption. For men, feminine behavior was negatively correlated with total alcohol, wine and beer consumption. Masculine behavior was positively correlated with total alcohol, wine and beer consumption; weight was negatively correlated with wine consumption. Except in the case of wine, sex-role variables were found to account for more of the variance in alcohol consumption than did biological gender. Feminine behavior was negatively associated with alcohol consumption for both men and women. Masculine behavior was positively associated with alcohol consumption for men.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Validity of the MacAndrew scale in a general medical population.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was scored for the MacAndrew (MAC) Scale in a series of samples totaling 14,789 subjects. These samples included 1077 substance-dependent patients (739 men), 7090 selected medical outpatients (2853 men), 5000 unselected medical outpatients (2500 men), 214 psychiatric inpatients (92 men) and 1408 contemporary normal (646 men). Overall, the MAC Scale correctly classified only 70.7% of the men and 37.9% of the women alcoholics. However, when samples of men and women alcoholics were broken down into four age groups, the MAC Scale correctly identified 90% of men alcoholics in the 18- to 24-year age group but only 41% of women alcoholics in the same age group. In addition, the predicted rate of alcoholism in the samples that were not substance-dependent, using the MAC Scale, was approximately 1.5 to 4 times the estimated lifetime prevalence rate (this was also true in the 18- to 24-year age group). MMPI item 215 ("I have used alcohol excessively") correctly identified 95% of the men and 94% of the women alcoholics. It was concluded that, except for men less than 24 years old, the MAC Scale is not an appropriate screening test for substance dependence in a predominantly middle-class medical population.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Self-report validity issues.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two possible sources of the substantial gap usually found between survey self-reported alcohol consumption estimates for a population and estimates based on official alcohol sales records are investigated. A measure of atypical heavy drinking is added to ordinary consumption commonly measured in surveys, and consumption by an adolescent (age 14-17) sample is added to that of the adult sample. The relationship between respondents' purchases and consumption during a 30-day period is also investigated. Personal interviews were completed with a random sample of 997 adults and 182 adolescents in Iowa during February-April 1985. Adding atypical drinking to ordinary drinking narrowed the sales-self-report gap more than did adding adolescent drinking, but a considerable gap remained. Self-reported purchases were closer to sales than was self-reported consumption. However, not all purchasers were drinkers and not all drinkers were purchasers, and the two were not highly correlated. The self-report validity issue, which remains unresolved, is apparently affected by many factors. Self-reports appear to be accurate enough for some purposes but not for others. Official alcohol sales (or purchase) records are not necessarily valid measures of alcohol consumption.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A comparison of black and white women entering alcoholism treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Similarities and differences between Black and White women in the early stages of alcoholism treatment were investigated. Characteristics relevant to treatment and to the risk of early treatment discontinuance were examined including health-related attitudes and beliefs, personality characteristics, alcoholism history, and social and situational factors. Data were obtained through interviews with 25 Black and 67 White women who had recently entered an alcoholism treatment facility. Black women had a significantly lower income and were on average 5 years younger than White women. After controlling for income and age, discriminant function coefficients indicated that ethnic differences also existed in women's perceptions about the role of health professionals in the maintenance of health, consequences of drinking, social isolation, self-esteem, access to alcoholism insurance, contact with important others and degree of opposition to treatment from others. Implications of the results for treatment continuance and service delivery are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Predictors of attrition from an outpatient alcoholism treatment program for couples.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Applicants (N = 105, 22 women) to an outpatient alcoholism treatment research program for married couples were categorized into three classifications: (1) treatment refusers (N = 37), (2) treatment dropouts (N = 23) and (3) treated subjects (N = 45). Discriminant analyses were performed to determine the best predictors of eventual category from baseline data. Compared with those who consented to treatment, refusers were found to be younger, have shorter drinking histories and were less likely to have personally initiated contact with the treatment program. Dropouts were less likely than treated subjects to have made their own initial contact with the program, more likely to have depressive symptoms not associated with alcohol use and were not employed full time. Remaining in treatment was most strongly associated with marital factors--assignment of the couple to a marital therapy condition versus a treatment in which the spouse was not fully involved and the spouse's initial satisfaction with the marriage. Results are discussed in terms of the treatment implications for spouse involvement in treatment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of a change in drinking pattern on the cognitive function of female social drinkers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relationship between social drinking patterns and sober cognitive performance was evaluated, and the effects of a change in alcohol consumption on cognitive function were measured. Sixty female drinkers were randomly assigned either to abstain for 3 weeks or to continue to drink as usual; 25 female abstainers served as a comparison group. Subjects' drinking patterns during the last 6 months were assessed, and a battery of cognitive tests was administered both before and after the 3-week interval. Results indicated that cognitive performance at baseline was not inversely correlated with either the quantity or the frequency of drinking over the last 6 months. Furthermore, the abstinence manipulation did not result in differential improvement on any of the tests between the subjects who abstained and the subjects who continued to drink. Thus, recent drinking practices were not related to cognitive test performance in this sample of female social drinkers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Alcoholic beverage preference as a public statement: self-concept and social image of college drinkers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Several studies have indicated that drinking-driving violation rates differ significantly across beverage preference groups. In an effort to assess beverage-specific alcohol expectancies, surveys of 120 college students probed self-concept, drinker stereotypes, beverage preference and quantity-frequency of alcohol consumption. The results revealed sharply differentiated social stereotypes for hypothetical drinkers of various alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. Beverage preference groups differed little in self-concept except that men who preferred beer or mixed drinks rated themselves as more drunk than did men who preferred wine or nonalcoholic beverages. Combining all beverage preference groups, heavier drinkers rated themselves more positively and they rated male nondrinkers more negatively on most dimensions than did lighter drinkers. Support was found for some, but not all, extrapolations from consistency theory and enhancement theory in predicting beverage choice.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The results of a national survey of tavern going are reported; special attention is paid to the drinking patterns, reasons for attending, types of places frequented and social characteristics of the "regular" (i.e., the person who usually attends the same establishment and with some frequency). Most Canadians make some use of pubs, but only a few are regulars. Regulars are young, unmarried and heavier than average drinkers. Persons going to taverns, lounges, nightclubs and private clubs differ in social characteristics and these attributes are related to the activities and social functions associated with the various types of public drinking establishments.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of tryptophan availability on selection of alcohol and water by men.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To study the effects of tryptophan on alcohol selection the tryptophan levels in subjects were altered through the administration of amino acid mixtures. Male social drinkers (N = 45) with no psychiatric or medical problems were divided into three groups and consumed a drink that contained, respectively, a nutritionally balanced amino acid mixture, a tryptophan-supplemented mixture, or a tryptophan-free mixture. After a waiting period of 5 hours, blood samples were taken and subjects participated in an ad-lib taste rating of six--one nonalcoholic and five alcoholic--beverages. Water was also made available to subjects. Although there was a marked effect on total and free plasma tryptophan levels showing a dramatic increase in the case of the tryptophan-supplemented group and a decrease in the tryptophan-free group, altered tryptophan levels did not influence the amount of alcohol subjects ingested. Tryptophan supplementation was found to decrease water intake significantly by an unknown mechanism without affecting alcohol selection.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Alcohol-related problems of children of heavy-drinking parents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Alcohol-related problems that are experienced by sons and daughters of heavy-drinking parents (either father or mother) are examined using data from a 1978 household sample of employed adults in metropolitan Detroit. Adult children with heavy-drinking parents were found to have a higher percentage of dependent problem drinking than those without heavy-drinking parents. Also, adult children with low status (blue-collar) occupations were found to have a higher percentage of dependent problem drinking than those with high status (white-collar) occupations. Although it was not possible to disentangle the genetic processes from the social processes in this study, the results support the hypothesis that having both heavy-drinking parents and low occupational status places sons and daughters at elevated risk for alcohol-related problems. Implications for future epidemiological studies are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Passive and assertive student interventions in public and private drunken driving situations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The types and frequency of interventions used to prevent drunken driving across four different locations is examined. A drinking survey of 247 students provided 97 subjects who indicated that someone had attempted to prevent them from driving under the influence (DUI). Results suggest that the location of the drinking modestly influences the type of intervention, that the more assertive intervention has a higher success rate and that private or more intimate gatherings promote less assertive interventions. Given the failure of deterrence, further understanding of how, why, when and who does and does not intervene, and what, when and who is and is not successful are promising research directions. Most importantly, however, is the need to conceptualize drunken drivers and the reactions to their potential DUI. It is suggested that the social support-stress literature may be useful in that it provides us with a social psychology of both effective and ineffective crises management. Status and age characteristics are the sociological parameters that must be included if we are to clarify and improve our understanding and move toward an informed policy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Extroversion, anxiety and the perceived effects of alcohol.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To test the hypothesis that personality characteristics are related to alcohol-effect expectancies, 256 (115 men) college students were divided into groups on the basis of self-reported alcohol consumption and anxiety and introversion scores on the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire. Three-way multivariate analyses of variance were conducted to determine expectancy differences by drinking behavior, personality characteristics and sex. Alcohol expectancy scores were found to vary with drinking behavior and personality measures. Elevated expectancy scores were associated with higher quantity-frequency measures of drinking; however, no significant sex differences were obtained. Extroverted students expected more social and physical pleasure, more relaxation and less arousal with drinking. Students with higher levels of trait anxiety expected more global positive changes, sexual enhancement, social assertion and arousal. The association of drinking behavior and personality with expectancies appears to be independent and additive.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Depressive symptoms and persistence in treatment for alcohol dependence.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relationship between alcoholics' depressive symptoms during their preadmission evaluations and persistence in treatment for alcohol dependence is evaluated. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine the contribution of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores to the prediction of the criterion: number of continuous days in treatment (up to 120). After several sources of variance were removed (age, race, age X race interaction, number of previous treatments and referral source), BDI score explained 10.8% of the criterion's variance. The full model explained 28.2%. Early withdrawal occurred in association with freedom from measurable affective distress during preadmission evaluation. A model for the prediction of number of continuous days in treatment is presented.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We have devised a two-stage operation for poor-risk patients with carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus. The first-stage operation consists of a right thoracotomy, subtotal esophagectomy, and lymph node dissection. Two to three weeks later, the second-stage operation of esophageal reconstruction with gastric tube is performed under laparotomy. During this 3-week period of no esophagus, the nutritional status can be adequately maintained by intravenous hyperalimentation. We describe herein the technique, postoperative complications, and mortality of our two-stage operation as compared with events during an ordinary one-stage operation for carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Proximal gastrectomy as the surgical procedure of choice for upper gastric carcinoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess the efficacy of proximal gastrectomy in the treatment of upper gastric carcinoma, we analyzed clinical data from patients with lesions confined to the upper third of the stomach (group 1) and from patients with lesions which, while primarily located in the upper portion of the stomach, showed spread to the body of the stomach (group 2). Patients in group 2 showed more metastatic lymph node involvement, particularly of the infrapyloric lymph nodes, which were not included in lymphadenectomy accompanying proximal gastrectomy. None of the group 1 patients demonstrated metastasis to the infrapyloric lymph nodes. The postoperative 5-year survival rate in curatively operated group 1 patients was not significantly different between those treated by proximal gastrectomy and those subjected to total gastrectomy. We conclude that proximal gastrectomy is indicated in patients with upper gastric carcinoma when it is confined to the upper third of the stomach.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Management of endoscopically removed malignant colon polyps.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The medical records of 87 patients with 89 malignant colorectal polyps removed endoscopically between 1971 and 1983 were reviewed retrospectively. Fifty-five polyps contained carcinoma-in-situ. Four polyps had "pseudo-invasion" by displaced mucosal glands. Thirty polyps contained invasive carcinoma. No patients with carcinoma-in-situ or "pseudo-invasion" had either local residual disease or metastatic disease at the time of colectomy or which was detected during subsequent follow-up. Four patients (14%) with invasive cancer would have been inadequately treated by polypectomy alone, since one had residual disease at the polypectomy site, one had nodal metastases, one had liver metastases at the time of colectomy, and one subsequently developed liver metastases. Three histologic criteria correctly predicted all four cases where residual or recurrent disease was present: involvement of the polypectomy resection margin, lymphatic invasion within the polyp, and poorly differentiated histology. Polyp size, histology (villous adenoma, adenomatous polyp, or villo-adenomatous polyp), or anatomic location did not identify those patients who warranted further therapy. We conclude that polypectomy alone is adequate treatment for polyps containing carcinoma-in-situ. Polypectomy alone is also adequate treatment for most polyps containing invasive carcinoma. However, patients with lymphatic involvement within the polyp, poorly differentiated cancer, or resection margin involvement should probably undergo colectomy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Verrucous pseudonevoid melanoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A case of an unusual variant of malignant melanoma resembling a papillomatous dermal nevus is presented here. The lesion was initially diagnosed as a Spitz nevus, and recurred locally five months after excision. The features which distinguish this lesion from the more common types of benign dermal nevi include the architectural atypia of the melanocytes, with a tendency for continuous proliferation of single cells along the dermoepidermal junction, as well as the presence of cytologic atypia with large hyperchromatic nuclei and mitoses. Despite its seemingly innocent appearance, distinction of this low-grade variant of melanoma from its benign counterparts is of importance in order to avert the possibility of recurrence and potential metastases.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of both a vitamin E-deficient and a high polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diet was tested on rats injected with the colon carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). In vivo lipid peroxidation was monitored by measuring exhaled ethane from the animals. Higher mean weights were found in animals fed high PUFA and vitamin E-sufficient diets. There was no difference in ethane exhalation between DMH-treated and control animals regardless of diet. Mean ethane exhalation was highest in animals fed either vitamin E-deficient or high PUFA diets. There was no difference in tumor formation between the vitamin E-deficient and the vitamin E-sufficient groups. The high PUFA groups had more tumors than the low PUFA groups. Diet was shown to be the major factor affecting ethane exhalation. There was no evidence that vitamin E-deficiency promoted DMH-induced tumors or that DMH caused increased lipid peroxidation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intracavitary bleomycin and tetracycline in the management of malignant pleural effusions: a randomized study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Both bleomycin and tetracycline have been suggested as the sclerosing agent of choice in the management of malignant pleural effusions. To determine if one drug is superior to the other in this role, patients with malignant pleural effusions were randomly assigned to receive either bleomycin or tetracycline in the previously evacuated pleural space through a thoracostomy tube. Following instillation of the assigned agent, the tube was clamped for 8 hours and then reattached to suction. When the chest tube drainage had slowed to less than 40 ml in a 24-hour period or if 7 days had passed, the tube was removed. Pleural sclerosis was attempted 42 times in 34 patients. No statistically significant differences were found between the two treatment groups when prevention of effusion reaccumulation and time to removal of the chest tube (efficiency) were compared. Side effects including pleural pain and fever, occurred with both agents, but were manageable. Since one drug was not clearly superior to the other, and bleomycin is more costly, we suggest that tetracycline rather than bleomycin be used when pleural sclerosis is needed to manage malignant pleural effusions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Survival of operated bronchus carcinoma patients: a prospective study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Maximum diameter, tumour volume, and inflammatory response of host tissue in 282 surgical specimens with primary carcinoma of the bronchus were measured. Cell type, pT- and pN-stage, maximum diameter and volume of the primaries, and inflammatory response of host tissue were analyzed in respect to survival of the patients. Date of death was evaluated by quarterly communications with the house physicians. Survival rates were computed by use of Kaplan-Meier estimation. Mean survival of all patients was calculated at 480 days. Lymph node involvement and tumour volume were found to have a major influence on survival. In accordance with the weak contribution of maximum diameter of the tumour to survival, no major differences in survival between pT1- and pT2-stage were found. If severe inflammatory response at the tumour boundary was noted, patients showed slightly increased survival in all tumour stages. Cell type and tumour grading were found to be of minor influence in respect to survival.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgical treatment of intestinal radiation injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A review of 43 consecutive patients requiring operation for serious intestinal radiation injury was undertaken to elucidate the efficacy of surgical treatment. The most common site of radiation injury was the rectum (19 cases), followed by the small bowel (13 cases), the colon (7 cases), and the combination of these (4 cases). The overall operative mortality was 14%; morbidity, 47%; and the postoperative symptom-free period, 18 +/- 30 months. Colostomy (N = 20) carried the lowest risk of mortality, 0%, as compared with resection (N = 17) and bypass procedure (N = 6), which were accompanied by the mortalities of 24% and 33%, respectively. During the follow-up (3-13 years) 12 patients (28%) died of recurrent cancer and 9 patients (21%) of persistent radiation injury, which yielded an overall mortality of 65% after resection and 50% and 65% after bypass and colostomy procedures, respectively. Continuing radiation damage led to 15 late reoperations. Ten of these were performed after colostomy, four after resection, and one after bypass. We conclude that colostomy cannot be regarded as a preferred operative method, because it does not prevent the progression of radiation injury and because it is, for this reason, associated with a higher late-complication rate. A more radical surgery is recommended but with the limitation that the operative method must be adapted to the operative finding.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Imaging of colon carcinoma with 111-indium-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies (Indacea) prior to surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Patients with primary and/or metastatic colorectal cancer who had been scheduled for operative intervention were injected intravenously with 200 micrograms of a high-affinity anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody labeled with 2 mCi of 111-indium (Indacea). Patients were imaged by gamma camera at 24 and 48 hours. Primary tumors were identified in 3/10 cases and were not visualized in 3/10 cases. Four scans were considered equivocal. Hepatic metastases were identified as image defects in 5/13 cases and were not visualized in 8/13 cases. All tumors contained CEA by immunoperoxidase staining. In all cases, the primary tumor uptake (5.44 +/- 1.07% ID/kg) was much higher than the uptake of the adjacent fat (0.18 +/- 0.04% ID/kg). There was a direct correlation between tumor CEA content, tumor radioactivity, and the imaging of primary tumor by Indacea. High liver uptake (30.3 +/- 3.0% ID/kg), seen when scanning all patients, was the main limitation of imaging and led to photopenic visualization of hepatic metastases. These results suggest that selection of patients with colorectal carcinoma on the basis of tumor CEA content will lead to improved rates of tumor imaging by Indacea in post-surgical scanning.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tricuspid regurgitation in patients with acquired, chronic, pure mitral regurgitation. I. Prevalence, diagnosis, and comparison of preoperative clinical and hemodynamic features in patients with and without tricuspid regurgitation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Most reports of clinical experiences with palliation of acquired tricuspid regurgitation have failed to address the issue of coexisting disease of the mitral or aortic valve, or both. To accurately determine the natural history and the effect of operative interventions, we studied patients with chronic, pure mitral regurgitation who had surgical treatment at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute from 1968 to 1984. Forty-seven patients fulfilled the criteria of a documented history of mitral regurgitation for more than 1.5 years, minimal mitral diastolic gradient, severe mitral regurgitation by angiography, and no prior mitral or tricuspid operative procedure. Twenty-five of the 47 patients (53%) had evidence of tricuspid regurgitation. No statistical differences in age, sex, mean duration of symptoms of congestive heart failure, or functional class were found between those patients with and those without tricuspid regurgitation. However, patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure for more than 6 years were more likely to have tricuspid regurgitation. This increased prevalence also correlated with higher elevations of left ventricular end-diastolic, systolic pulmonary artery, and mean right atrial pressures. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation estimated preoperatively did not correlate statistically with that determined by digital palpation, although the presence of tricuspid regurgitation was reliably confirmed. These data demonstrate that tricuspid regurgitation is frequently present in patients with chronic, pure mitral regurgitation and is associated with prolonged symptoms of congestive heart failure and significant alterations in right heart dynamics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tricuspid regurgitation in patients with acquired, chronic, pure mitral regurgitation. II. Nonoperative management, tricuspid valve annuloplasty, and tricuspid valve replacement.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The incidence, preoperative and intraoperative diagnosis, methods, and the clinical and hemodynamic features of patients with and without tricuspid regurgitation associated with chronic mitral regurgitation were presented in Part I. This study (Part II) compares the early and late results in patients with chronic, pure mitral regurgitation undergoing isolated mitral valve replacement, mitral replacement and tricuspid valve annuloplasty, and mitral and tricuspid valve replacement. The mean follow-up interval was 6 years. Those with the longest duration of symptoms (18 years) required tricuspid and mitral valve replacement (11 patients), whereas those with the shortest duration (8.1 years) had only mitral replacement (22 patients). Eight patients had minimal tricuspid regurgitation by digital palpitation, with no procedure performed, and six had tricuspid valve annuloplasty, only one of whom received a ring support. Operative mortality rate was similar in all groups (13% to 18%). All but two of the surviving patients improved by at least one New York Heart Association functional class, and no statistically significant differences were found between preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic data. There were no statistically significant differences in survival at 1, 5, or 8 years (85%, 70%, and 60%, respectively) for patients with or without TR. Only two of the surviving five patients who underwent tricuspid valve annuloplasty were alive 3 years after operation, whereas 70% to 80% of those with mitral replacement or mitral and tricuspid replacement were alive after the same time interval. It is not clear whether or not the pathogenesis of tricuspid regurgitation resulting from mitral regurgitation is different from that of tricuspid regurgitation resulting from mitral stenosis. It is our contention that whether tricuspid regurgitation arises because of anatomic destruction of the tricuspid valve or because of right ventricular dilatation with tricuspid annular enlargement, the underlying mitral valve lesion may determine the preoperative and postoperative courses of these patients. Therefore, when tricuspid valve disease is being evaluated, we urge that patients be categorized by the nature of their underlying mitral or aortic valve lesions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Structural composition of central pulmonary arteries. Growth potential after surgical shunts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Failure to achieve adequate pulmonary artery growth in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease is a major obstacle to surgical correction. To assess whether differences in structural composition of central pulmonary arteries influence their growth potential after surgically created shunts, we obtained full-thickness biopsy specimens from the hilar pulmonary arteries of eight patients with pulmonary atresia or tetralogy of Fallot undergoing modified Blalock-Taussig shunts under 1 year of age. Tissue was processed for electron microscopic studies and a morphometric assessment was made of the volume proportions of smooth muscle, collagen, ground substance, and elastin. Initial pulmonary artery size was determined angiographically during the diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Pulmonary artery size was determined by cross-sectional echocardiograms 7 to 27 months later (mean 19 months). Pulmonary artery growth did not correlate with the interval between examinations but did correlate with the volume proportion of elastin (r = 0.73, standard error of the estimate = 1.45, p less than 0.05). Thus the structural composition of pulmonary arteries may influence their potential for growth after surgical shunts. In particular, an inadequate proportion of elastin may be a hindrance to growth.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A better prognostic value from a modification of lung cancer staging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This prospective study analyzes the survival rate, according to TNM and staging, of 538 patients who underwent curative pulmonary resection for non-oat cell tumors and who survived the operative period. A total of 279 patients had Stage I disease, 113 Stage II, and 146 Stage III. The overall survival rates were 72% at 1 year, 54% at 2 years, 47% at 3 years, 43% at 4 years, and 39% at 5 years. The survival curves of Stages I, II, and III are significantly different. Nevertheless, in Stage I, T1 N0 tumors presented the best survival rate (71% at 5 years), and this was significantly different from those of all other groups. For Stage II, the survival curves were significantly different according to hilar or lobar location of N1. The survival rate of T2 N1 hilar tumors was similar to that of T2 N2 tumors. In Stage III, the survival of T3 N2 tumors was the worst of all classifications. These results may contribute to a reappraisal of the surgical classification. T1 N0 tumors are worthy, on their own, of forming Stage I. T2 N0, T1 N1 lobar, and T2 N1 lobar can constitute Stage II. Stage III or IIIa would comprise carcinomas classified T2 N1 hilar, T1 N2, T2 N2, and perhaps T3 N0 and T3 N1. T3 N2 should probably be isolated in a IIIb or IV stage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Critical aortic stenosis. Survival and management.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The factors associated with survival in 40 neonates (age less than 28 days) with critical aortic stenosis undergoing either open (22 patients) or closed (18 patients) transventricular aortic valvotomy were reviewed. Significant adverse correlates with survival included evidence of poor perfusion preoperatively (low pH, greater than Grade 2/6 soft ejection systolic murmur) and marked congestive heart failure (hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly, elevated left atrial pressure). Congenital mitral stenosis (anulus less than 11 mm), a small aortic anulus (less than 6.5 mm), and failure to achieve an adequate aortic orifice (greater than 6 mm), at operation were identified as factors associated with increased mortality. Initial perioperative survival was better with closed aortic valvotomy. However, there was no significant difference in overall operative survival between closed (9/18, 50%) and open (8/22, 36%) aortic valvotomy (p = 0.26). The incidence of early reoperation (less than 1 year of age) was greater in perioperative survivors undergoing closed valvotomy (7/13, 54%) rather than open valvotomy (1/10, 10%) (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, long-term survival among patients with critical neonatal aortic valve stenosis remains disturbingly low (13/40, 32%) and has not significantly improved over the past 20 years.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Patterns of pulmonary arterial anatomy and blood supply in complex congenital heart disease with pulmonary atresia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To identify the pattern of pulmonary anatomy and pulmonary blood supply, we analyzed the angiocardiograms of 40 patients with pulmonary atresia and complex congenital heart disease. All patients but two (95%) had confluent pulmonary arteries supplied by a patent ductus arteriosus. These two patients (5%) had nonconfluent pulmonary arteries, one with major systemic-pulmonary collateral arteries and absent patent ductus arteriosus and the other with a patent ductus arteriosus supplying the right lung and small collateral arteries supplying the left. The low incidence of pulmonary arterial abnormalities and the uniform pattern of pulmonary blood supply make the patients with pulmonary atresia and complex congenital heart disease potential candidates for palliative operation without cardiac catheterization in the neonatal period.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Radionuclide transit in patients with colon interposition.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess radionuclide transit in interposed segments of the colon, we examined 25 patients with colon interposition for benign esophageal disease. No such assessment has been reported previously. The most common indications for operation were esophageal strictures that developed after lye ingestion and reflux strictures not responding to other treatment. The operations were performed without thoracotomy by blunt esophageal dissection in 80% of the patients. There were 18 antiperistaltic and seven isoperistaltic colon grafts. A large-field gamma camera and computer system were used. Data were collected at time intervals of 0.5 second during the first 30 seconds and at intervals of 30 seconds up to 20 minutes. The 5% and 90% stomach filling times, times to 50% and 25% activity levels, and residual activity levels as a percentage of the maxima were calculated in the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the colon grafts and of the normal esophagus of 10 healthy control subjects. The examinations were performed with the subject in a sitting position. All parameters showed that emptying of the colon graft was markedly slower than that of the normal esophagus. The intra-abdominal third of the graft had a residual activity of 50.5% +/- 15.7% after 20 minutes' observation. No differences between antiperistaltic and isoperistaltic grafts were observed. Reconstruction with proximal cologastric anastomosis and a short intra-abdominal colon graft segments is suggested.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Age-related differences in the response to myocardial ischemic stress.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clinical experience indicates that the risk of reparative cardiac operations is increased in the neonatal period relative to that in older infants and children. Age-related differences in the susceptibility to myocardial ischemic dysfunction were evaluated by comparison of left ventricular function and metabolism in neonatal (mean age = 7 days) and weanling (mean age = 96 days) piglets. Six animals in each group supported on cardiopulmonary bypass were subjected to (1) 120 minutes of hypothermic crystalloid cardioplegic arrest (CP-120) and (2) 15 minutes of normothermic ischemic arrest (NA-15) after a 60 minute interval of reperfusion. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was measured after each intervention via endocardially implanted ultrasonic dimension crystals in a septolateral minor-axis position. In both groups, systolic dysfunction was evidenced by an increase in the dimension-axis intercept (p = 0.001), but not the slope of the end-systolic pressure-dimension relation. Left ventricular end-diastolic stiffness, expressed as left ventricular end-diastolic pressure versus Lagrangian strain, increased to a similar degree in both groups (p = 0.001). Adenosine triphosphate levels declined significantly (p = 0.001) in both groups in response to the ischemic interventions with no evident intergroup differences. Lactate levels increased significantly during the course of the experiment (p = 0.04); however, the increases were greater (p = 0.009) at all intervals in the neonatal group. This study demonstrates age-related metabolic differences in response to ischemia consistent with a greater dependence on glycolysis in neonatal myocardia. However, the fact that discriminating age-related differences in left ventricular function were not evident suggests that factors other than young age per se account for the increased surgical mortality in the neonatal period.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The necessity for tricuspid valve repair can be determined intraoperatively by two-dimensional echocardiography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Residual significant tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve operations may significantly increase postoperative morbidity and mortality. However, routine techniques to detect tricuspid regurgitation preoperatively and intraoperatively are inaccurate. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed intraoperatively to assess its ability to evaluate and quantify the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. In 50 patients who underwent cardiac operations, 5 ml of dextrose or saline was injected into the right ventricle to generate echogenic "contrast." In patients with tricuspid regurgitation, there was systolic reflux of contrast into the right atrium, which could be semiquantified on a scale of 0 to 4+. Besides correlating well with preoperative Doppler studies for the presence or absence of tricuspid regurgitation in 18 patients (sensitivity = 0.90, specificity = 1.00), the intraoperative contrast method could quantify the severity of reflux. The 50 patients were divided into two groups on the basis of severity of tricuspid regurgitation as assessed by intraoperative two-dimensional contrast echocardiography. Group I (36 patients) had no or mild (0-2+) regurgitation, and Group II (14 patients) had moderate to severe (3-4+) tricuspid regurgitation. Patients with significant tricuspid regurgitation (Group II) had greater intraoperative preprocedure and postprocedure systolic and diastolic pulmonary pressures. Additionally, the systolic tricuspid anulus length, as measured in the intraoperative right ventricular inflow view, correlated better with severity of tricuspid regurgitation (r = 0.76, p = 0.005) than mean pulmonary pressure (r = 0.52, p less than 0.01). Therefore, intraoperative contrast two-dimensional echocardiography can accurately assess the relative severity of tricuspid regurgitation. Importantly, intraoperative measurement of tricuspid anulus diameter could predict the presence of significant echocardiographic tricuspid regurgitation before as well as immediately after the operation. Two-dimensional echocardiography may be an important intraoperative method both for evaluating the presence and severity of residual tricuspid regurgitation immediately after left heart operations as well as for determining which patients should undergo tricuspid valve repair.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary sinus blood flow before and after resection of left ventricular aneurysm after myocardial infarction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The patients in this study consisted of eight men who underwent resection of left ventricular aneurysm. Right and left heart catheterization at rest and measurement of coronary sinus blood flow by continuous thermodilution were performed preoperatively and an average of 6 months after the operation. Coronary sinus blood flow decreased significantly from 161 to 118 ml/min and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased significantly from 17.2 to 10.5 ml/min postoperatively. Cardiac index increased postoperatively. Ejection fraction increased from 0.31 to 0.49 and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening significantly increased from 0.53 to 1.0 circ/sec postoperatively. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume decreased significantly from 166 to 120 ml/m2 postoperatively. The mean systolic circumferential tension significantly decreased postoperatively. We believe that the decrease in wall tension postoperatively brought about the reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption. Thus the high wall tension and myocardial oxygen demand, present preoperatively, were improved postoperatively, with a resultant lowering of oxygen consumption and equivalent or better left ventricular function.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Left ventricular aneurysm with predominating congestive heart failure. A comparative study of medical and surgical treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- From 1979 to 1985, 109 patients were treated for congestive heart failure caused by postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm. Congestive heart failure was predominant in all patients at the time of diagnosis, 73% of whom were in Functional Class III or IV. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure averaged 23.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error of the mean), total ejection fraction 29.7% +/- 1.0%, and telediastolic volume of the aneurysm 76.2 +/- 5.8 ml. Aneurysmectomy was performed in 49 patients (45%), whereas the remaining 60 patients were treated medically. The two groups did not differ in regard to clinical and hemodynamic data on admission, except for a more extensive coronary artery disease in the surgical group. Follow-up was obtained for all patients (100%) and averaged 48 +/- 3 months. Actuarial survival curves were similar, and the 5-year survival rates for surgical and medical groups were 70 +/- 7% and 64% +/- 7%, respectively (not significant). However, the 5-year complication-free rate was significantly (p = 0.05) higher among surgical patients (52% +/- 8%) than among the medical group (31% +/- 7%). Multivariate analysis showed the following variables to influence survival independently (p less than 0.05): contractile segment ejection fraction, right ventricular failure, antecedents of cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock, and corrected contractile score. Independent variables decreasing the risk of cardiac-related complications and death (p less than 0.05) were as follows: surgical treatment, shorter interval between initial infarction and diagnosis of aneurysm, and absence of right ventricular failure. Functional improvement was directly related to surgical treatment and to residual segment contractile score (p less than 0.05). Thus, in patients with congestive heart failure caused by left ventricular aneurysm, surgical treatment improved the quality of life and prognosis for cardiac-related complications, but did not increase overall survival, compared to medical management of similar patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Actuarial survival, freedom from reoperation, and other events after repair of atrioventricular septal defects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Repair of an atrioventricular septal defect was performed in 134 patients from 1973 to 1985. Interventricular communication was present in 54 (40%) and none was present in 80 (60%). There were 12 hospital deaths (9%; 70% confidence limits 6%-12%). Earlier date of operation (p = 0.03) and younger age at repair (p = 0.005) were incremental risk factors for hospital death after repair of partial atrioventricular septal defect. Smaller size (p = 0.003) and longer cross-clamp time (p = 0.002) were risk factors for hospital death in those patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect. Higher preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance was a risk factor for death in both groups (p = 0.007). The 10 year actuarial survival rate was 82% overall. Increasing preoperative severity of left atrioventricular valve incompetence was not a risk factor for early (p = 0.001) or late (p = 0.002) death. The 10 year actuarial freedom from reoperation after repair of partial atrioventricular defects was 85%, and it was 68% for complete atrioventricular defects (p = 0.06). We conclude that the intermediate term results after repair of atrioventricular septal defects are good. Incompetence of the left atrioventricular valve has apparently been neutralized as a risk factor for hospital death in this series. However, the durability of the repair has been disappointing. A policy of earlier repair has been adopted and should improve hospital mortality and permit better preservation of the atrioventricular valve structures with resultant improved late term functional status.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The protein C system in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifteen men undergoing extracorporeal circulation for aorta-coronary bypass grafting were investigated for alterations of the plasma levels of cross-linked fibrin degradation products, protein C, free protein S, coagulation factor II, immunoglobulin G, and albumin. Although all patients were given heparin, a progressive increase of cross-linked fibrin degradation products was recorded during extracorporeal circulation, which indicates an activation of the plasmatic coagulation system. This increase was most pronounced in the late phase of extracorporeal circulation after reperfusion of the lung and in the early postoperative period. The levels of all other investigated plasma proteins decreased drastically after the patient was connected to the bypass circuit, which was primed with saline solution. These levels increased after termination of extracorporeal circulation and administration of fresh-frozen plasma. To study the consumption of protein C, protein S, and factor II during extracorporeal circulation, we formed ratios of the values of these parameters to the value of immunoglobulin G. After this volume correction, protein C was found to decrease significantly in the late phase of extracorporeal circulation, remaining low in the early postoperative period; protein S increased significantly soon after the onset of extracorporeal circulation and decreased after termination of extracorporeal circulation; factor II was unaffected by extracorporeal circulation, showing only a slight, insignificant increase in the postoperative phase. These results suggest a disturbance of the protein C system by extracorporeal circulation, which is possibly linked to the reported high bleeding tendency in patients undergoing operations with extracorporeal circulation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Calcium-induced ventricular contraction during cardioplegic arrest.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cardiac arrest induced by hyperkalemic perfusion is generally considered to represent a state of complete electromechanical arrest. However, high-energy phosphate concentrations and ventricular function decrease with increasing cardioplegic calcium concentrations, possibly because of elevated resting muscle tone produced by calcium influx. We examined isolated rat hearts containing an isovolumic intraventricular balloon for the presence of contractile activity during the administration at 10 degrees C of a cardioplegic solution containing potassium, 20 mEq/L. Significant left ventricular pressure was developed (35.6% +/- 4.3% of prearrest systolic pressure) during administration of a solution containing a calcium concentration of 1.0 mmol/L and far less (9.7% +/- 1.6% of prearrest systolic pressure) with a calcium-free cardioplegic solution. The muscle contraction diminished with repeated doses, was increased by increasing cardioplegic calcium content, and was inhibited by magnesium. Adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate concentrations were 9.0 +/- 1.4 and 7.0 +/- 0.9 nmol/mg dry weight immediately after infusion of 15 ml of a hypoxic cardioplegic solution containing calcium, versus 13.3 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.02) and 31.9 +/- 3.5 nmol/mg dry weight (p less than 0.0001) after a hypoxic acalcemic solution was given. When repeated doses of a hypoxic cardioplegic solution containing calcium in a concentration of 1.0 mmol/L were given at 15 minute intervals at 10 degrees C, ischemic contracture (a sustained development of ventricular pressure, mean 51% +/- 4% of prearrest systolic pressure) resulted within 1 hour. Coronary vascular resistance was increased during the muscle contractions induced by calcium-containing solutions, markedly so during contracture. Calcium-related mechanical activity was also observed during hypothermic cardioplegic arrest in five of six isolated isovolumic canine hearts. We conclude that hearts remain potentially active mechanically during cold hyperkalemic arrest and undergo energetically wasteful contraction when stimulated with calcium-containing hyperkalemic cardioplegic solutions.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We prospectively studied the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety of endoscopic laser treatment in 25 patients with dysphagia from advanced esophageal cancer. Malignant stenoses were recanalized in all patients, and the ability to swallow was improved in about 80%. Results were best in patients with adenocarcinomas and in those who reported a good appetite. A single laser treatment provided adequate palliation in more than half the patients until the time of death. In those patients in whom stenosis recurred, re-treatment was necessary a median of 3.2 months after the initial laser treatment. No laser-related mortality or major morbidity occurred. We conclude that endoscopic laser therapy seems to be a feasible method of palliating malignant dysphagia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tracking and prediction of blood pressure in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A significant but weak correlation between an initial and a subsequent blood pressure measurement in the same patient has been found in several previous longitudinal studies of blood pressure in children. In the current study, single determinations of blood pressure, weight, and height were recorded in 142 children at 5.9 to 9.5 years of age and again 9 years later. Both examinations were performed in a schoolroom. Body size at the first examination was associated with body size 9 years later. A significant correlation was noted between initial and subsequent raw systolic blood pressures (r = 0.36 in boys and in girls; P less than 0.01). Correlations of systolic blood pressure based on percentiles for age and for height and weight were smaller but also statistically significant. Correlations involving diastolic blood pressure, with use of raw blood pressure measurements, were significant only for boys (r = 0.24, P less than 0.05). Correlations were not improved when indices of body size were used. Single blood pressure measurements obtained under the usual conditions in a schoolroom had only slightly weaker correlations with subsequent blood pressure determinations than those obtained in studies in which considerable care was taken to achieve more "basal" measurements. This degree of blood pressure correlation is insufficient to allow accurate prediction of subsequent blood pressure levels on the basis of a single casual blood pressure measurement in an individual child. This result was indicated by a wide 95% confidence interval for the predicted subsequent systolic blood pressure, even when sex, initial diastolic blood pressure, weight, and change in weight were considered.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Imaging of cranial chordomas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical, pathologic, and imaging characteristics of clival chordomas in 14 patients who underwent magnetic resonance examinations were evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was compared with skull series, tomography, computed tomography (CT), and magnification angiography in the diagnosis of clival chordomas. Although all examinations were highly sensitive for the detection of clival chordomas, MRI was the best single study because of its ability to image in orthogonal planes, its excellent soft-tissue contrast, and its demonstration of the relationship between the neoplasm and regional vital structures, particularly the brainstem, cavernous sinus, cranial nerves, and neighboring vessels. The deficiencies of MRI are poor visualization of tumoral calcification and osseous destruction--findings that are better identified on CT. In all 14 cases, MRI revealed the neoplasms to be black on inversion-recovery, gray on partial-saturation, and white on T2-weighted pulse sequences. Three chordomas had a speckled signal void pattern, typical of tumor calcification.</ABSTRACT>

- Vancomycin is a narrow-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic used primarily for treatment of serious staphylococcal infections. It is the alternative therapy of choice when the penicillins and cephalosporins cannot be used. Vancomycin is also used in (1) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections; (2) streptococcal endocarditis in conjunction with an aminoglycoside in patients intolerant of penicillin or ampicillin; (3) infections, including those involving prosthetic devices, caused by gram-positive organisms with multiple antibiotic resistance; (4) antibiotic-induced enterocolitis caused by Clostridium difficile; and (5) prophylaxis for endocarditis in patients who are at risk and cannot tolerate a penicillin, cephalosporin, or erythromycin. The major toxic effect associated with the use of vancomycin is ototoxicity, which may develop when serum levels exceed 30 micrograms/ml.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The tetracyclines are effective in the treatment of Chlamydia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and rickettsial infections and may also be used for gonococcal infections in patients unable to tolerate penicillins. These drugs may cause gastrointestinal irritation, photo-toxic dermatitis, diarrhea, vestibular damage, and hepatotoxicity in pregnant women. Chloramphenicol is used primarily for anaerobic infections, Haemophilus influenzae meningitis, and typhoid fever. The most important toxic effect of chloramphenicol is bone marrow suppression, which can be dose related or idiosyncratic. Erythromycin is the drug of choice for the treatment of infections caused by M. pneumoniae, Legionella species, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The frequency of serious untoward effects associated with the use of erythromycin is low; epigastric distress may occur. Clindamycin is active against Bacteroides fragilis and other anaerobic microorganisms. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis has developed in as many as 10% of patients taking this drug. The use of clindamycin should be discontinued promptly if diarrhea occurs.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Despite the introduction of newer, less toxic antimicrobial agents, the aminoglycosides remain useful in the treatment of serious, hospital-acquired, gram-negative bacillary infections, especially those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Formidable nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have limited the use of neomycin to topical or oral administration. Widespread antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae has restricted the use of streptomycin and kanamycin to a few specific clinical situations. Gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin are active against a wide range of Enterobacteriaceae and many P. aeruginosa organisms. In medical centers where gentamicin resistance is prevalent, amikacin is the aminoglycoside of choice. Fortunately, amikacin resistance has not seemed to increase substantially, even in institutions where usage has been extensive for a long period. No new aminoglycoside has proved to be superior to amikacin.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- An immunocytochemical technique has been developed to detect the oestrogen receptor (ER) in samples obtained by fine-needle aspiration of primary or secondary breast carcinoma tissue. 45 (75%) of 60 samples contained sufficient cells for analysis. 19 (90%) of 21 patients who responded to endocrine therapy had samples with ER-positive cells compared with only 7 (39%) of 18 of those who did not respond (p less than 0.001). This test, which causes little pain to the patient and does not need a surgical biopsy, is as accurate as any other method of predicting the response to endocrine treatment in breast cancer.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Human papillomavirus infections in women with and without abnormal cervical cytology.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- 9295 smears, obtained from women attending three gynaecological hospitals for routine screening, were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 and HPV 16 and 18 infections by filter in-situ hybridisation. The data were compared with cytological findings. In women with normal cytological smears HPV infection was identified in about 10% of women aged between 15 and 50 years and in less than 5% of those aged over 50. In women with abnormal smears (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] I, II, and III and invasive cancer) HPV infection was detected in 35-40%; this rate seemed to be age-independent. the Peak incidence of CIN appeared several years after that of HPV infection. In women aged greater than 30 years it also declined earlier than did HPV positivity. The age-group distribution of women with CIN I, II, and III differed significantly from that of patients with invasive cancer. Only about a third of HPV-positive patients remained virus-positive, probably because of fluctuations in virus production and the insensitivity of the test system used. It is possible that filter in-situ hybridisation underestimates the total rate of HPV infections by a factor of 2 to 3.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- DNA polymorphism of human porphobilinogen deaminase gene in acute intermittent porphyria.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A common two-allele MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism of the human erythroid porphobilinogen (PBG)-deaminase gene was investigated in 33 unrelated patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and 20 controls. The polymorphism was tightly linked (lod score 3.14; no recombinants) to the locus for AIP as identified by measurement of erythrocyte PBG-deaminase activity. The frequency of the polymorphism in the AIP patients did not differ significantly from that in the controls. No common polymorphisms for eight other restriction endonucleases were found in either group. In 30 of the AIP patients no crossreacting immunological material (CRIM) was produced by the mutant PBG-deaminase allele. The MspI polymorphism enabled each PBG-deaminase allele to be distinguished in subjects heterozygous for the polymorphism; thus a major gene deletion was excluded as the cause of the CRIM-negative mutation in all of the 18 families that contained an affected CRIM-negative individual heterozygous for the polymorphism. In suitable families, the MspI polymorphism provides a more certain way of identifying carriers of the AIP gene than current enzymatic methods and major gene deletions are unlikely to be present in more than a small proportion of the commonest type of AIP, the CRIM-negative form.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Explanation for potency of repeated oral doses of morphine?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Morphine given by injection is the standard by which all other strong analgesics are measured, but when given orally in single doses it is a poor analgesic. With repeated oral administration it becomes very effective and it may be that on repeated dosage active metabolites, particularly morphine-6-glucuronide, account for much of the analgesic activity. Enterohepatic circulation may also contribute to the maintenance of blood and tissue levels of morphine and its metabolites in chronic use.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Arm circumference and other factors in children at high risk of death in rural Bangladesh.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) was measured monthly for 6 months in about 500 children aged 6-36 months from rural Bangladesh. Children who would die within 1 month of screening could be identified with 94% specificity and 56% sensitivity--almost twice the sensitivity achieved by other anthropometric screening schemes for this level of specificity. Specificity was slightly improved when the absence of breast-feeding, concurrent diarrhoea, oedema, and acute respiratory infection were taken into account. Children at high risk of death can be detected by monthly measurement of MUAC, which may be used in poor communities where interventions have to be selective.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Experience with hepatitis B vaccination in nurses in a hospital for the mentally handicapped.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The extent of HBV infection in the staff of a large hospital for the mentally handicapped was investigated. Nurses with direct patient contact were identified as a particular risk group and hepatitis B vaccination was offered to them. Of the 500 who received a full course of vaccination 96% had detectable antibodies 9 months after starting vaccination. High titres (over 1000 IU/l) were found in 59.4%. Females responded better than males and the response was age-dependent. In only 2 of 20 non-responders did lasting immunity develop with a fourth dose of vaccine. Antibody titre decreased rapidly in all vaccinees followed up. In vaccinees with an initial titre above 100 IU/l the decrease in titre could be reversed by a booster dose. Those with a titre below 100 IU/l had a variable response to the booster dose and lasting immunity developed in only a few. A recall system was started that predicts when a booster dose will be required to maintain a protective level of antibody. Servicing such a vaccination programme is not easy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Are some hypertensive patients overtreated? A prospective study of ambulatory blood pressure recording.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was recorded in hypertensive patients whose physicians had been asked to reduce diastolic pressure measured in the office to 90 mm Hg or less. 34 hypertensive patients with a diastolic pressure measured by their physician of 95 mm Hg or more despite antihypertensive therapy had their treatment changed with the aim of achieving this pre-set goal within 3 months. At the beginning and the end of the study, ambulatory BP was monitored during the daytime with a portable non-invasive recorder. The results of the ambulatory recordings were not made available to the physicians until completion of the study. In half the patients the ambulatory diastolic pressure was already 90 mm Hg or less at the start. In these patients, treatment adjustment did not further decrease ambulatory BP. In contrast, patients who initially had an ambulatory diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg had a significantly decreased ambulatory BP at the end of the study. Intensifying the therapy of hypertensive patients who have a normal ambulatory BP may result in overtreatment without any real gain in BP control.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Haemophilus aegyptius bacteraemia in Brazilian purpuric fever. Brazilian Purpuric Fever Study Group.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF) is a fulminant, often fatal childhood illness that was first recognised in 1984. An outbreak in Serrana, Sao Paulo State in March to May, 1986, resulted in 11 cases. Haemophilus aegyptius was isolated from normally sterile body fluids in 10 children (9 from blood and 1 from cerebrospinal fluid contaminated with blood), consistent with a direct role for H aegyptius in the pathogenesis of BPF. The ability to define cases by positive blood cultures permitted an evaluation of the spectrum of illness of this disease. 5 culture-positive cases were clinically similar to those previously described; the other 5 had milder illness without petechial or purpuric skin manifestations at the time the bacterium was isolated. Blood cultures were a sensitive means of diagnosing BPF; cultures were positive in 5 of 6 patients that met the full clinical case definition. Treatment of conjunctivitis did not appear to prevent BPF. However, children treated with intravenous antimicrobials early in the systemic illness had a trend toward better survival, suggesting that early therapy may prevent progression of the illness..I 56284  .U  88012823  .S  Lancet 8801; 2(8562):763-7  .M  Acute Disease; Adolescence; Adult; Aged; Agricultural Workers' Diseases; Burma; Case Report; Chronic Disease; Female; Hormones/BL; Human; Hypoglycemia/ET; Hypopituitarism/BL/*ET; Male; Middle Age; Prospective Studies; Snake Bites/BL/*CO; Viper Venoms/PO.  .T  Acute and chronic pituitary failure resembling Sheehan's syndrome following bites by Russell's viper in Burma.  .P  JOURNAL ARTICLE.  .W  Pituitary function was investigated in 9 patients in shock after Russell's viper bites and in 24 individuals who had been severely envenomed 2 weeks to 24 years previously. 3 out of 9 patients had hypoglycaemia and inappropriately low serum cortisol, plasma growth hormone, and plasma prolactin concentrations. 4 who died had pituitary haemorrhage and 1 had adrenal haemorrhage as well. Of the 24 who had apparently recovered from bites, 7 had clinical features of hypopituitarism and no response in plasma growth hormone or prolactin concentrations to symptom-producing insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. 4 of these 7 had a sluggish serum cortisol response to 'Synacthen Depot' and 5 had an abnormal cortisol response to hypoglycaemia. 4 men with symptoms who were tested had low serum testosterone concentrations; serum thyroxine was also low in these men but not in 2 women with menstrual disturbances and impaired insulin responses. Of the 17 individuals without clinical evidence of endocrine disease, 4 had pituitary hormonal abnormalities. Russell's viper envenoming may thus produce a disorder resembling Sheehan's syndrome.  </ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cancer in offspring of long-term survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A multicentre retrospective cohort study of long-term survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer identified 7 cases of cancer among 2308 offspring (0.30%) of 2283 case-survivors and 11 cases among 4719 offspring (0.23%) of 3604 controls. Overall, the observed numbers of cases were not significantly different from those expected in the general population. Among offspring of case-survivors observed for the first 5 years of life, the group with the most person-years of follow-up, 5 cancers were reported (3 confirmed), compared with 1.7 expected, a significant excess due mostly to boys whose mothers survived cancer. Some offspring with cancer had known single-gene traits; others resembled previously recognised patterns of family cancer. The remainder may represent chance occurrences or new cancer family syndromes, such as an association with malignant melanoma. The study had an overall 79% power to detect a 3-fold excess of cancer among offspring of case-survivors, but no excess was observed. The number person-years of follow-up in the second decade of life, when most cases of cancer developed, was small.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Erythrocyte crenation induced by free fatty acids in patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Normal erythrocyte morphology is necessary for proper distribution of blood-flow in the microcirculation. Erythrocyte shape was studied in 20 patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation (EC) during coronary bypass surgery. Crenated erythrocytes comprised a mean 64% of all erythrocytes during and 29% after EC. Free fatty acid (FFA) content of the erythrocyte membranes was significantly increased at both times, and FFA content correlated with the proportion of crenated erythrocytes. Washing crenated cells with defatted albumin solution transformed them back to discocytes, simultaneously removing more FFA than that removed from pre-EC discocytes. The plasma FFA to albumin ratio became disproportionately increased during EC; the increased level correlated with severity of erythrocyte crenation. Maintaining a higher level of albumin during EC by adding 50 g human albumin to the extracorporeal system prevented erythrocyte crenation. Entry of plasma FFA not bound to albumin into erythrocyte membranes during EC causes massive erythrocyte crenation.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The frequencies of 80 HLA antigen phenotypes in 82 centenarians and 20 nonagenarians in Okinawa, Japan, were compared with those in other healthy adults in various age-brackets. Subjects aged over 90 had an extremely low frequency of HLA-DRw9 and an increased frequency of DR1. In this age-group the relative risk of corrected (for number of antigens) p value for HLA-DRw9 were 5.2 and 0.0001, respectively; those for HLA-DR1 were 13.3 and 0.0367, respectively. Since a high frequency of DRw9 and a low frequency of DR1 are associated with autoimmune or immune deficiency diseases, the genetic protection against these disorders may contribute to longevity.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- In 2 years in Leeds, two paediatricians diagnosed sexual abuse in 94 boys and 243 girls. 38% were under 5 at diagnosis and the mean age was 8.0 years. 39% presented following disclosure by the child. 83% of boys and 25% of girls had anal signs and 58% of girls had genital signs. 60% of abusers were related to the child and half of these were natural fathers. 25% of all abusers were teenagers and 5% were women. The abuser was convicted in 25% of cases and protective legal orders were sought in 36%. Sexual abuse is emerging as a major child and mental health problem that requires new resources in training and personnel.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Aortic and mitral valve calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The frequency and aetiology of aortic valve and mitral annular calcification was studied by echocardiography in 87 patients aged 35-70 on maintenance haemodialysis for a mean of 7.5 years (range 0.5-19). Aortic valve calcification (AVC) was found in 24 patients (28%) and mitral annular calcification (MAC) was found in 31 (36%). AVC was severe and produced aortic stenosis in 5 patients with a tricuspid aortic valve (mean age 51.6 years), which confirms that calcific aortic stenosis is a complication of chronic uraemia. MAC was associated with functional mitral stenosis in 1 patient. Premature AVC and MAC were associated with an increased calcium X phosphate product and long-term haemodialysis. There were no significant differences between those patients with aortic stenosis and those with AVC but no stenosis. Patients with AVC had an increased incidence of MAC and vascular calcification. Premature AVC and MAC is frequent in dialysis patients and appears to be related to abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism and to increased mechanical stress on the valve cusps. In a small but important group of patients on long-term dialysis, premature valve calcification is severe and produces aortic stenosis, or less frequently, mitral stenosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Selective immunodeficiency affecting staphylococcal response.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Eight patients with recurrent staphylococcal infections, necessitating up to 213 hospital admissions in one patient, gave normal results with the usual immunological investigations, including measurement of serum IgG and IgG2. In the staphylococcal inhibition test all showed persistently subnormal results, corrected by the addition of compatible normal plasma or normal IgG therapy for 6 months to 21 years, and one died from staphylococcal septicaemia 6 months after withdrawal of treatment. The impairment in anti-staphylococcal response, with failure to produce adequate antibodies, was probably acquired in utero in four patients and inherited in two. In these six patients symptoms started soon after 4 months. In the remaining two the syndrome was acquired later in life.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Energy requirements of pregnancy in Scotland.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Measurements of energy intake, basal metabolic rate, body weight and composition, and physical activity were made on 88 women throughout pregnancy. Mean weight gain (from 10 wk to 40 wk gestation) was 11.7 kg, birthweight 3370 g, and placental weight 641 g. Maternal fat gain (from 10 wk) calculated by three methods was 2.1 kg. The total rise in basal metabolism for the whole of pregnancy was calculated to be 126 MJ (1 MJ = 239 kcal). The total increase in energy intake was estimated as 88 MJ. There was little evidence of any changes in either the energy cost of physical activity or the time spent in these activities. The total energy cost of laying down fetal and maternal tissues and the increased metabolism was 281 MJ, which was offset by a possible increase in energy intake of only 88 MJ. The most likely explanation for the deficit of 193 MJ is that many small reductions in energy expenditure occurred which were not detectable by the methods used.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Salmonella ealing infections associated with consumption of infant dried milk.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In an outbreak of Salmonella ealing infections in November and December, 1985, the proportion of infants infected was in excess of the normal distribution pattern and the cases were geographically widespread. All the infected infants had been fed with a dried-milk product from one manufacturer. Despite intensive efforts to isolate S ealing from packets of the product, it was found only in low numbers in 4 of 267 sealed packets. The source of infection was traced to the factory spray-drier, which had a hole in its inner lining, allowing escape of powder and its return from contaminated insulation material. The plant was closed and the equipment scrapped and later replaced. It is recommended that raw milk and whey, which frequently contain salmonellae, should not be allowed onto the site of milk-drying plants.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Petrous apex and subarcuate fossa maturation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During the first year of life, the bone of the petrous apex grows rapidly. At birth, only 5 mm of bone separates the cochlea from Dorello's canal as compared to 2 cm in the adult. More than half this growth occurs during the first year of life. The subarcuate fossa is a cavity within the superior semicircular canal which reaches from the posterior fossa to the future mastoid in fetuses and nearly to the mastoid antrum in newborns. During the second year of left it is nearly obliterated to form a shallow depression or slit on the posterior aspect of the temporal bone and the variable petromastoid canal which contains the subarcuate artery and vein. Clinical petrositis of infants less that 1 year of age is rare, and provides a challenge for surgery. A case is reported and discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Unusual head and neck manifestations of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in children and adults.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Certain patterns of "lymphoma masquerade" are examined, where the diagnosis is very difficult to establish. The presence of prolonged symptoms prior to the acute event or indolent slow healing wounds should alert clinicians to the possibility that lymphoma may be involved. Localizing tumors in order to make a tissue diagnosis is one potential problem encountered even with computerized tomography, but magnetic resonance imaging has been helpful in demonstrating the presence of tumor mass. Included in this report is an unusual series of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases in which there was not an obvious tumor. Three patients presented with symptoms and findings of deep neck abscess, two of which were associated with an esophageal perforation or tracheoesophageal fistula. The other cases involved chronic sinusitis and an apparent viral polyneuropathy affecting multiple cranial nerves. Treatment of these non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and techniques for establishing the pathological diagnosis are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Permanent middle ear aeration: long-term follow-up of transosseous ventilating tubes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A technique for achieving permanent middle ear aeration by inserting a flanged silicone tube (SPAT) through a hole drilled in the external auditory canal was introduced in 1970. Since 1970, we have used the transosseous procedure in 36 patients (11%) of cases that required middle ear ventilation. The average length of time the transosseous SPAT functioned was 51 months (range 0-138). Best results were obtained in patients over 16 years of age, when chronic ear surgery was not performed simultaneously. Transient otorrhea occurred in 23% of cases. Forty-four percent of tubes became blocked and required removal or were extruded. No patient developed facial weakness, middle ear cholesteatoma, or persistent tympanic membrane perforation. In selected cases, the transosseous SPAT provides long-term middle ear aeration without the risk of permanent tympanic membrane perforation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reconstructing the absent lenticular process.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- When a surgeon encounters an absent lenticular process of the incus, he must either reposition the incus or attempt to bridge the small gap between the remaining incus long process and the stapes capitulum. Our solution to this problem is to place a Lippy modified Robinson stapes prosthesis on the stapes footplate and attach it to the remaining long process, thus bypassing the stapes superstructure. This modified Robinson prosthesis has a portion of the well removed allowing the eroded long process to enter from the side. The hearing results of 63 cases at 6 months (two-thirds of which had a concurrent tympanoplasty) are 67% within 10 dB and 91% within 20 dB of the preoperative bone hearing level. The use of an existing and proven prosthesis provides both stability and, to date, the most successful hearing results for reconstructing the absent lenticular process.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The first 100 patients in a series of 616 cerebellopontine angle tumors were compared to the most recent 100 patients. All of the first 100 patients were evaluated prior to the common use of CT or ABR. Recently, improved diagnostic studies have resulted in the discovery of significantly smaller tumors. The later group of patients was also found to have their symptoms for a shorter period of time and had better overall hearing at the time of diagnosis. Reductions in the rates of various complications were also observed. These trends are felt to be the direct result of improved audiologic and radiologic diagnostic studies. A heightened awareness of all otolaryngologists to seek the diagnosis of acoustic neuroma also improved early diagnosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Residual and recurrent acoustic neuromas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective study was conducted on all 23 patients who underwent operation for residual or recurrent acoustic neuromas during the 10-year period January 1976 through December 1985. The most common symptoms at the time of reoperation were ataxia (16 patients), facial paresthesias (13 patients), and headaches (9 patients). Primary procedures had consisted of suboccipital posterior fossa approaches in 22 patients and a middle fossa approach in one. Reoperation for recurrent or residual tumor consisted of a retrosigmoid approach in 17 patients and a translabyrinthine or translabyrinthine/retrosigmoid approach in six patients. This study confirms that residual or recurrent acoustic tumors are not common. It also suggests that long-term follow-up, for at least 7 to 8 years, is indicated.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Technological advances in neuroradiology and the development of skull base surgery in neurotology have improved diagnosis and management of lesions eroding the tegmen tympani. The diagnosis of brain hernia is to be suspected in patients with a history of complicated chronic ear surgery and a slowly developing pulsatile mass with CSF leak. Patients are best evaluated in the upright position, with an otomicroscope and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Over 6 years, our group has treated seven patients with eight space-occupying lesions eroding the tegmen. Five of the lesions were repaired with a temporalis muscle flap, 2 with fascia and bone, and 1 with Marlex. A review of new technology in the diagnosis of brain hernia and a modification of previous techniques is given.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of glutathione and vitamins A, C, and E on acute skin flap survival.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Vitamins A, C, and E act as antioxidants and as free radical scavengers in biological systems. Glutathione is involved in several reactions in vitamin metabolism and also plays an important role in cell membrane protection against lipid peroxidation by free radicals. We sought to use these natural defense mechanisms against oxygen free radicals formed during reperfusion of ischemic skin flaps. An acute axial random skin flap model was utilized in the rat. Vitamins or glutathione were administered by oral gastric tube or intravenously in the perioperative period, and survival of the flap was measured at 1 week. Glutathione, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid and alpha-D-tocopherol showed mean flap survival of 84% to 89%, each of which was significantly improved over saline controls (67% p less than .0005). The mechanisms and biochemistry of these vitamins, and their interactions with other vitamins and with glutathione, are discussed, along with clinical implications of free radical scavenging and skin flap survival.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Aspiration is analyzed by a new scintigraphic technique and standard videofluoroscopy in 78 patients with head and neck pathology and neurologic disorders. When both methods are compared to clinical aspiration and a positive x-ray film of pneumonia, they appear to complement each other and provide a very accurate evaluation. Scintigraphy is a more sensitive method for detecting aspiration below the vocal cords and also provides for flow dynamics and a method of quantifying the amount of aspirated material. Videofluoroscopy shows more clearly the mechanism of the swallowing disorder and how the bolus enters the tracheobronchial tree. Studies in patients following head and neck surgery demonstrate a high incidence of dysphagia, aspiration, and pneumonia.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The unique clinical experience of having to treat simultaneously nine young adults who had ingested the same corrosive substance prompted this investigation in rabbits of the pathophysiology of corrosive esophageal injury and of drugs that might prevent formation of stricture. Treatment of experimental corrosive esophageal injury in these animals consisted of antegrade dilatation and administration of two lathyrogenic drugs, colchicine and penicillamine, in various combinations. This study demonstrated that the rabbit can serve as a suitable animal model for study of corrosive injury of the esophagus, that penicillamine given alone affected wound healing with less severe stricture after such an injury, and that colchicine was associated with delayed wound healing and severe stricture.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- In this study, a statistical evaluation of the hearing improvement, the incidence of postoperative tinnitus and vertigo, and the permanency of the surgically restored hearing of 120 women and 80 men operated on for otosclerosis between 1970 and 1971 was undertaken. The standardized operating procedure in all of these cases involved the use of a Gelfoam and wire prosthesis (Schuknecht 3). All patients underwent normal audiological examinations, including determination of bone and air conduction values. Pure tone thresholds were determined by averaging the values for 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz. The incidence (10%) of severe sensorineural loss in regard to age, preoperative bone conduction, and oval window pathology was examined. Severe sensorineural losses had occurred immediately postoperatively in 14 of the ears. In the remaining ears, losses were gradual in the course of 15 years. Hearing thresholds in ears not subjected to operation were also determined.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The influence of body mass in cross-country skiing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The influence of body weight on the performance in cross-country skiing has been studied by: dimensional analysis of the ratio (R) between the factors of importance to power production (VO2max, acceleration of gravity) and the braking powers, e.g., friction and air resistance; measuring the energy cost of level skiing (N = 6); comparing male world class skiers (N = 5) with less successful ones (N = 34) and female winners of the National Championships (N = 9) with non-winners (N = 9) in regard to the relationship between body weight and VO2max. The dimensional analysis revealed that R was less than unity for rather steep uphills. For level, downhill, and less steep uphill skiing, R was greater than unity. Thus, skiers who are light will be favored in steep uphill slopes, whereas heavier skiers have advantages in the other parts of the track. Energy cost per kilogram for level skiing was inversely related to the transported mass. Per unit of distance, this cost was positively related to velocity. The world class skiers displayed significantly greater VO2max than the less successful ones, regardless of the unit used. The lowest standard deviation among the world class skiers was attained when expressing VO2max as ml X min-1 X kg-2/3. The present results indicate that R will be quite close to unity and therefore the performance capability would theoretically be independent of body mass. Furthermore, VO2max is preferably expressed as ml X min-1 X kg-2/3 for cross-country skiers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Drop jumping. I. The influence of jumping technique on the biomechanics of jumping.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In the literature, drop jumping is advocated as an effective exercise for athletes who prepare themselves for explosive activities. When executing drop jumps, different jumping techniques can be used. In this study, the influence of jumping technique on the biomechanics of jumping is investigated. Ten subjects executed drop jumps from a height of 20 cm and counter-movement jumps. For the execution of the drop jumps, two different techniques were adopted. The first technique, referred to as bounce drop jump, required the subjects to reverse the downward velocity into an upward one as soon as possible after landing. The second technique, referred to as counter-movement drop jump, required them to do this more gradually by making a larger downward movement. During jumping, the subjects were filmed, ground reaction forces were registered, and electromyograms were recorded. The results of a biomechanical analysis show that moments and power output about knee and ankle joints reach larger values during the drop jumps than during counter-movement jumps. The largest values were attained during bounce drop jumps. Based on this finding, it was hypothesized that bounce drop jump is better suited than counter-movement drop jump for athletes who seek to improve the mechanical output of knee extensors and plantar flexors. Researchers are, therefore, advised to control jumping technique when investigating training effects of executing drop jumps.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Drop jumping. II. The influence of dropping height on the biomechanics of drop jumping.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In the literature, athletes preparing for explosive activities are recommended to include drop jumping in their training programs. For the execution of drop jumps, different techniques and different dropping heights can be used. This study was designed to investigate for the performance of bounce drop jumps the influence of dropping height on the biomechanics of the jumps. Six subjects executed bounce drop jumps from heights of 20 cm (designated here as DJ20), 40 cm (designated here as DJ40), and 60 cm (designated here as DJ60). During jumping, they were filmed, and ground reaction forces were recorded. The results of a biomechanical analysis show no difference between DJ20 and DJ40 in mechanical output about the joints during the push-off phase. Peak values of moment and power output about the ankles during the push-off phase were found to be smaller in DJ60 than in DJ40 (DJ20 = DJ60). The amplitude of joint reaction forces increased with dropping height. During DJ60, the net joint reaction forces showed a sharp peak on the instant that the heels came down on the ground. Based on the results, researchers are advised to limit dropping height to 20 or 40 cm when investigating training effects of the execution of bounce drop jumps.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Enkephalins, catecholamines, and psychological mood alterations: effects of prolonged exercise.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seven healthy trained men were studied to determine if running at various relative intensities [percent maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)] alters peripheral venous levels of leucine enkephalin-like material. Enkephalins were measured using a radio-receptor assay (Leu-Enk RRA). Subjects ran for 80 min at 40 and 60% VO2max and for 40 min at 80% VO2max. Each session was separated by at least 1 wk. Heart rate, blood pressure, lactic acid, and rectal temperature responses increased in an intensity-dependent manner. Epinephrine increased from resting values of 38.2 +/- 6.8 pg X ml-1, mean +/- SE to 75.0 +/- 13.3 pg X ml-1 during the 40% VO2max run, from 60.2 +/- 15 to 186 +/- 45 pg X ml-1 during the 60% run, and from 33.4 +/- 7.6 to 311 +/- 52 pg X ml-1 at the 40th min of the highest workload (80% VO2max). These increases were significant (P less than 0.05). Plasma Leu-Enk RRA was between 3.8 and 6.2 pmol X ml-1 prior to each run and did not change significantly as a result of exercise. Levels of Leu-Enk RRA also did not change during 30 min of supine recovery. Perception of effort increased (P less than 0.05) with increases in exercise intensity, and effort sense was unrelated to plasma Leu-Enk RRA. Psychological tension decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) following exercise at 60 and 80% of VO2max, but the decrease following the 40% run was not significant (P greater than 0.05). Reduced tension following exercise was not related to Leu-Enk RRA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ratings of perceived exertion at the lactate threshold in trained and untrained men and women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of state of training and gender on ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) at the lactate threshold (LT), and to determine whether RPE during moderate to heavy sub-maximal exercise is more closely associated with LT or %VO2max. RPE at the LT (RPELT) and at various percentages of VO2max were compared in 10 male and 10 female trained distance runners, and 10 male and 10 female untrained subjects, 18 to 35 yr of age. Mean (+/- SD) VO2max [ml X kg FFW-1 (fat-free weight) X min-1] of the trained men and women (72.3 +/- 1.4 and 73.1 +/- 1.6) was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than for the untrained men and women (60.2 +/- 1.4 and 53.2 +/- 1.8), confirming their higher cardiorespiratory capacity. Similarly, the mean LTs (%VO2max) of the trained men and women (79.2 +/- 1.7% and 73.3 +/- 1.8%) were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than for the untrained men and women (66.5 +/- 3.3% and 58.9 +/- 3.3%), and mean values for the men were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than for the women. The means for RPELT for the four groups, 13.6 +/- 2.1, 13.5 +/- 1.6, 13.5 +/- 1.5, and 12.9 +/- 1.3, respectively, were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05), even though the ratings were given at markedly different levels of VE, VO2 (1 X min-1), heart rate, and %VO2max.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metabolic responses during hydraulic resistance exercise.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirteen college-age men under-went a treadmill (TM)-graded VO2max exercise test on 1 d and a 24.5-min hydraulic resistive exercise circuit on a following day. Seven exercises were performed in the following order: leg extension, bent-over row, bicep curl, squat, upright row, bench press, and behind-neck press. Each exercise was performed three times with the following work-to-rest timing: 30 s exercise, 30 s rest; 30 s exercise; 30 s rest; and 30 s exercise, 60 s rest (to allow for machine switch-over to the next exercise). Thus, each exercise took a total of 120 s, of which work was for 90 s and rest 120 s. During the circuit, heart rate averaged 153.8 b X min-1 (81.2% of TM max) and VO2 averaged 1.93 l X min-1 (41.4% of TM max). Oxygen uptake for the individual exercises ranged from 1.52 l X min-1 (32.6% of TM max) for the behind-neck-press exercise to 2.43 l X min-1 (52.1% of TM max) for the squat exercise. Heart rate ranged from 135.9 b X min-1 (71.8% of TM max) for the leg extension exercise to 163.4 b X min-1 (86.3% of TM max) for the squat exercise. Hydraulic circuit resistance exercise results in an average caloric expenditure of 40.8 kJ X min-1 (9.75 kcal X min-1).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sprint training effects on muscle myoglobin, enzymes, fiber types, and blood lactate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to determine if changes in intra-muscular myoglobin concentration accompany histochemical and enzymatic adaptations to supra-maximal exercise training. Subjects were assigned to either a training group (N = 11), who trained 2 to 3 times weekly for 6 wk, or a control group (N = 6). Training progressed from two 15-s and two 30-s "all-out" sprints on a cycle ergometer during week 1 to six 15-s and six 30-s bouts per session during week 6. The Wingate test was performed before and after the 6 wk, but performance variables were not changed in either group. In the training group, peak lactate after the Wingate test was significantly higher after training. No significant changes in enzyme activities, myoglobin concentration, or fiber-type frequency were observed in the control group. In contrast, in the training group, the percent fast twitch oxidative fibers increased, myoglobin decreased, and both citrate synthase and phosphofructokinase activities increased (P less than 0.05). The results suggest that muscle myoglobin concentration is not increased by 6 wk of supra-maximal exercise training and that such training induces cellular adaptations without accompanying performance changes. Alternatively, the Wingate test is not a sensitive test of adaptations to the training.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physical fitness and hemodynamic response of women to lower body negative pressure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Aerobic fitness as assessed by maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) has been shown to be associated with an attenuated baroreflex function during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in men. Sixteen women (mean age = 24.7 yrs) were evaluated during progressive LBNP to -50 torr. Each subject's VO2max was determined using indirect calorimetry during the Bruce protocol exercise test. Eight subjects [mean VO2max = 56.8 (ml O2 X min-1) X kg-1] were designated as trained, and eight subjects [mean VO2max = 39.4 (ml O2 X min-1) X kg-1] were designated as untrained. During LBNP, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac index, forearm blood flow, and leg circumference were measured. All subjects completed the LBNP protocol without clinical symptoms of pre-syncope. The over-all hemodynamic responses of both groups to LBNP were qualitatively similar to previous findings reported for males. However, no significant differences in response of hemodynamic variables were observed between trained and untrained subjects during LBNP to -50 torr (P greater than 0.05) except for vascular resistance and diastolic blood pressure at -50 torr where the untrained value was greater than the trained value. This would suggest that a fitness-related difference may have been present at higher levels of LBNP. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports in males, the index of baroreflex responsiveness (delta heart rate/delta systolic blood pressure) was similar for both groups (P greater than 0.05). When these data were compared with a similar subject pool of males, the females displayed a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) tolerance of LBNP to -50 torr regardless of fitness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of beta 1-receptor blockade on coronary resistance in partially trained dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Selective beta 1-receptor blockade with atenolol (1 mg X kg-1, i.v.) was used to determine the effect of partial exercise training on diastolic coronary resistance (DCR) during sub-maximal exercise. Seven conscious dogs were studied in the untrained (UT) and partially trained (PT) conditions. The conditioning regime consisted of treadmill running 5 d X wk-1 for 4 to 5 wk. Left circumflex coronary flow, aortic pressure, and heart rate were measured, and DCR and myocardial oxygen consumption were calculated. During sub-maximal exercise, DCR in the UT dogs decreased from a resting value of 4.08 +/- 0.18 mm Hg X ml-1 X min-1 to 1.91 +/- 0.17 mm Hg X ml-1 X min-1 at a workload of 6.4 kph (speed)/16% (grade). During exercise, DCR was significantly greater in UT than in PT dogs. Atenolol significantly increased DCR at all levels of sub-maximal workload in both UT and PT dogs. However, the percent increase in DCR with atenolol was significantly greater in the PT dogs compared to UT dogs. These findings suggest that daily exercise for 4 to 5 wk may decrease beta 2-receptor activity of the coronary vasculature during sub-maximal exercise.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effects of resistance training on aerobic and anaerobic power of young boys.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 4-wk interval-type training program incorporating omni-kinetic equipment and stationary cycling elicited an increase in the absolute and relative VO2max of an active group of young boys. The improvement in aerobic function was independent of the training protocols of high velocity-low resistance and low velocity-high resistance. However, the training programs failed to increase anaerobic function as measured by an "all-out" cycle test in which power output was calculated in watts and watts per kilogram for 0- to 15-s and 15- to 30-s work periods. Changes in aerobic and anaerobic functions were independent of physiological maturity as determined by serum testosterone level (ng X dl-1).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Post-exercise echocardiography in pre-pubertal boys.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Echocardiography offers many advantages for non-invasively assessing cardiac function during exercise, but the use of this technique is hampered by interference created by respirations and body motion. The persistence of alterations in ventricular dimensions in the immediate post-recovery period, however, provides an artifact-free opportunity for evaluating recovery from the inotropic response of exercise stress. To determine the feasibility of this technique for children and to examine typical values in the pre-pubertal population, 20 boys had two-dimensional directed left ventricular M-mode echocardiograms performed before and after maximal treadmill exercise. Acceptable measurements were possible by 2 min of recovery in all subjects. Mean left ventricular shortening fraction at this time was increased 10% from resting values as a result of decreased end-systolic dimension. This study demonstrated the feasibility of post-exercise echocardiography in evaluating recovery left ventricular dimensions, but further examination of specificity, validity, variability, and reproducibility of this technique will be important in assessing its clinical usefulness.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Exhaustive running: inappropriate as a stimulus of muscle glycogen super-compensation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Muscle glycogen super-compensation, as demonstrated after exhaustive cycling, may be affected by mode of exercise and state of training. Hence, we studied the effect of exhaustive running on post-exercise changes in muscle glycogen concentration in untrained subjects and compared the effect of tapered running with an exhaustive bout of running in well-trained runners. Six trained runners (T), 6 untrained subjects (UT), and 6 physically active subjects participated. Four hundred grams of carbohydrate were given for 2 d (PX2 and PX1) before exercise and 600 g for 3 d (R1, R2, and R3) with rest afterwards. Before exercise, T and UT were restricted in physical activity. Biopsies were obtained from the gastrocnemius muscle on PX2 and PX1 in T, and before (PX0), immediately after exercise (R0), and on R1, R2, and R3 in all groups. Muscle glycogen increased from 110 (+/-14) on PX2 to 180 (+/-11) mmol X kg-1 on PX0 in T (P less than 0.001). This PX0 value was higher than the PX0 value for UT, which was 102 (+/-8) mmol X kg-1 (P less than 0.005). R0 values were 57 (+/-14) and 26 (+/-4) mmol X kg-1, respectively. On R1, the glycogen concentration had increased to 127 (+/-10) and 87 (+/-3) mmol X kg-1 (P less than 0.001). No changes occurred during R2 and R3. In a supplementary study, physically active subjects rested (series I) or ran lightly for 40 min (series II) on PX2 and PX1, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Semiischemic forearm exercise tests were carried out in two patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism who had muscle cramps and high serum levels of creatine kinase. Although cubital venous lactate levels increased normally after forearm exercise, venous ammonia and hypoxanthine were greatly increased. The abnormal responses of ammonia and hypoxanthine were normalized 3 months after treatment with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3. These findings suggest that excess purine degradation occurred in exercising muscles of patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Neurologic and electrophysiologic findings in a 57-year-old man with Whipple's disease are reported. The patient had severe proximal weakness and weight loss of more than 20 kg. Conventional electromyography and nerve conduction studies suggested mild neuropathy in distal segments of lower limbs and myopathy in proximal muscles. Automatic analysis of the electromyogram in proximal muscles was consistent with myopathy. Conduction velocity of muscle fibers in situ showed low propagation velocity of the impulse. Weakness, weight loss, and all the electrophysiologic parameters improved after treatment, including a compression of the peroneal nerve at the knee, perhaps related to weight loss (slimmer's paralysis).</ABSTRACT>

However, there has been no reported study on peroxisomal lipid metabolisms in myotonic dystrophy showing myotonia as well as experimental myotonia. We investigated one of the peroxisomal lipid metabolisms, i.e., plasmalogen metabolism in cultured skin fibroblasts from myotonic dystrophy, and found plasmalogen ratios to be significantly reduced.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Membrane defects in paramyotonia congenita (Eulenburg).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Membrane potentials, current-voltage relationships, and component conductances were determined in resting excised external intercostal muscle fibers from five patients with paramyotonia congenita. At 37 degrees C all investigated parameters were normal. At 27 degrees C the resting potentials decreased to about -40 mV, and the fibers were inexcitable. At this stage the membrane currents were much larger than in normal fibers owing to increases in the membrane conductances for Na and Cl ions. The earlier finding that in the cold the Na permeability is abnormally large was confirmed. The Cl permeability was shown to be normal even in the cold. The decrease of the resting potential and the changes in the current-voltage relationship at 27 degrees C could be prevented by the use of the Na channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by bathing the fibers in a Na-free solution. Our previous conclusion that the Cl conductance at 27 degrees C was also increased when TTX was present was not confirmed. Exposure of a muscle bundle to 7 mmol/l potassium did not lead to excessive depolarization and paralysis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases, and the incidence of anal cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To elucidate the risk factors for anal cancer, we interviewed and obtained blood specimens from 148 persons with anal cancer and from 166 controls with colon cancer in whom these diseases were diagnosed during 1978-1985. We found that in men, a history of receptive anal intercourse (related to homosexual behavior) was strongly associated with the occurrence of anal cancer (relative risk, 33.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 272.1). Anal intercourse was only weakly associated with the risk of anal cancer in women (relative risk, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 4.2). Among the subjects with squamous-cell anal cancer, 47.1 percent of homosexual men, 28.6 percent of heterosexual men, and 28.3 percent of women gave a history of genital warts, as compared with only 1 to 2 percent of controls and no patients with transitional-cell anal cancer. In patients without a history of warts, anal cancer was associated with a history of gonorrhea in heterosexual men (relative risk, 17.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 149.4) and with seropositivity for herpes simplex type 2 (relative risk, 4.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 8.8) and Chlamydia trachomatis (relative risk, 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.8) in women. Current cigarette smoking was a substantial risk factor in both women (relative risk, 7.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 17.2) and men (relative risk, 9.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 38.5). We conclude that homosexual behavior in men is a risk factor for anal cancer, and that squamous-cell anal cancer is also associated with a history of genital warts, an association suggesting that papillomavirus infection is a cause of anal cancer. Certain other genital infections and cigarette smoking are also associated with anal cancer.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- An improved method for prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases by analysis of amplified DNA sequences. Application to hemophilia A.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We report the development of a rapid nonradioactive technique for the genetic prediction of human disease and its diagnostic application to hemophilia A. This method is based on enzymatic amplification of short segments of human genes associated with inherited disorders. A novel feature of the procedure is the use of a heat-stable DNA polymerase, which allows the repeated rounds of DNA synthesis to proceed at 63 degrees C. The high sequence specificity of the amplification reaction at this elevated temperature permits restriction-site polymorphisms, contained in the amplified samples, to be analyzed by visual inspection of their digestion products on polyacrylamide gels. By means of this method, we have performed carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia in two families with use of the factor VIII intragenic polymorphisms identified by the restriction enzymes BclI and XbaI. Predictions can be made directly from chorionic villi, without previous DNA extraction, and fetal sex can be determined by amplification of sequences specific for the Y chromosome. Specific amplification of genomic sequences with heat-stable DNA polymerase is applicable to the diagnosis of a wide variety of inherited disorders. These include diseases diagnosed by restriction-site variation, such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia, those due to a collection of known mutations, such as beta-thalassemia, and those due to gene deletion, such as alpha-thalassemia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Absence of thrombosis in subjects with heterozygous protein C deficiency.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Protein C deficiency has been thought to be associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. To establish a normal range of values, we used a two-site monoclonal-antibody assay to measure protein C levels in 699 healthy adults. The distribution was log normal; 95 percent of the values ranged from 70 to 140 percent of the overall mean (4.03 micrograms per milliliter). Two subjects had levels more than 3.5 SD below the mean (34 and 50 percent), consistent with heterozygous deficiency. We also screened 4723 other blood donors and found 8 additional unrelated subjects with levels from 33 to 51 percent of normal. Autosomal inheritance of heterozygous protein C deficiency was confirmed in them by a detailed study of four families. Levels from 55 to 65 percent of normal are consistent with either heterozygous deficiency or the lower end of the distribution of normal values, and were found in 79 of 5422 subjects when the two groups were combined. None of the subjects had any history of venous thrombosis. We conclude that heterozygous deficiency of protein C has a prevalence of 1 in 200 to 300, a figure consistent with the known number of homozygous infants recently identified, and that levels consistent with heterozygous deficiency are found in 1 in 60 healthy adults but are not detectably associated with a risk of thrombosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Plasma glycocalicin. An aid in the classification of thrombocytopenic disorders.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In some patients with thrombocytopenia, it is difficult to determine whether the condition is caused by underproduction of platelets (reduced numbers of megakaryocytes) or an increase in the rate of their destruction (normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes). A non-invasive test to help distinguish between these two categories of thrombocytopenia would be useful. We related the plasma concentration of glycocalicin, a fragment of the platelet-membrane glycoprotein Ib, to the mechanism of thrombocytopenia by evaluating bone marrow megakaryocyte content and measuring platelet life span. Plasma glycocalicin was measured with a monoclonal antibody to the glycocalicin component of platelet glycoprotein Ib. The mean (+/- SD) plasma concentration of glycocalicin in 34 healthy controls was 87 +/- 20 percent of the level in pooled normal plasma (range, 52 to 127 percent). All of eight patients with aplastic anemia or amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia confirmed by examining bone marrow (in all patients) and by determining the life span of autologous platelets (in six patients) had glycocalicin levels significantly below the normal range (5 to 27 percent). In contrast, each of 25 patients with thrombocytopenia thought to be caused by a reduction in platelet life span, whose bone marrow contained normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes, had glycocalicin levels that fell within or above the normal range (48 to 261 percent). There was no overlap of values between the two patient populations. These studies indicate that the measurement of plasma glycocalicin may be a useful adjunct in classifying thrombocytopenic disorders.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intermittent coronary occlusion in acute myocardial infarction. Value of combined thrombolytic and vasodilator therapy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We performed continuous electrocardiographic ST-segment monitoring and serial coronary arteriography in 45 consecutive patients presenting in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction. During cardiac catheterization, 28 episodes of arteriographically confirmed coronary reopening and subsequent reocclusion were observed in 16 patients before (3 episodes) and during (25 episodes) continuous intracoronary infusion of streptokinase. In addition, ST-segment monitoring demonstrated 12 episodes of spontaneous transient return of the ST segment to the base line in eight patients between the time of admission and the performance of coronary arteriography. During arteriographically documented reocclusion, intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate (2 mg) reestablished the patency of the coronary artery within one to two minutes in 14 of 28 episodes that occurred in 11 of 16 patients. After streptokinase infusion, intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate was followed by dilatation of the infarct-related stenosis from a mean value (+/- SD) of 1.12 +/- 0.3 mm (58.1 +/- 12.1 percent) to 1.33 +/- 0.4 mm (51.6 +/- 12.9 percent; P = 0.004). Spontaneous intermittent coronary recanalization and reocclusion resulting from a variable combination of thrombosis and vasoconstriction are frequent during the early phase of acute myocardial infarction. We propose that the combination of intracoronary streptokinase and isosorbide dinitrate may increase the rate of stable coronary recanalization.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prevention of typhoid fever in Nepal with the Vi capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi. A preliminary report.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We conducted a pilot study followed by a large clinical trial in Nepal of the use of the capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi (Vi) as a vaccine to prevent typhoid fever. In the pilot study, involving 274 Nepalese, there were no significant side effects of the Vi vaccine; about 75 percent responded with a rise in serum antibodies of fourfold or more. In the clinical trial, residents of five villages were given intramuscular injections of either Vi or, as a control, pneumococcus vaccine dispensed in coded, randomly arranged, single-dose syringes. There were 6907 participants, of whom 6438 were members of the target population (5 to 44 years of age); each was visited every two days. Those with temperatures of 37.8 degrees C or higher for three consecutive days were examined and asked to give blood for culture. Typhoid was diagnosed as either blood culture-positive or clinically suspected on the basis of bradycardia, splenomegaly, and fever, with a negative blood culture. Seventeen months after vaccination, the codes were broken for the 71 patients meeting the criteria for either culture-positive or clinically suspected typhoid. The attack rate of typhoid was 16.2 per 1000 among the controls and 4.1 per 1000 among those immunized with Vi (P less than 0.00001). The efficacy of Vi was 72 percent in the culture-positive cases, 80 percent in the clinically suspected cases, and 75 percent in the two groups combined. These data provide evidence that Vi antibodies confer protection against typhoid. Surveillance continues to determine the duration of Vi-induced immunity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Primary cutaneous aspergillosis associated with Hickman intravenous catheters.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We describe nine patients with underlying hematologic cancer in whom primary cutaneous aspergillosis developed at the sites of Hickman intravenous catheters. Our patients, 17 to 74 years of age, were all immunocompromised either from their primary disease or from chemotherapy, and the Hickman catheters had been placed to provide venous access for chemotherapy or hyperalimentation or both. Clinical signs of infection included erythema, induration, and cutaneous or subcutaneous necrosis at the point of entry into the subclavian vein, in the subcutaneous tunnel, or at the exit site from the skin. Diagnosis was confirmed by positive wound culture for Aspergillus flavus in all but one patient. Treatment consisted of intravenous amphotericin B, oral flucytosine, and local wound care. Three patients recovered completely without operative debridement; three others recovered after operative debridement and delayed grafting. Two patients died of disseminated aspergillosis, and one died of unrelated causes while recovering from primary cutaneous aspergillosis. Successful treatment required resolution of aplasia or leukopenia, catheter removal, systemic treatment with amphotericin B, and local wound care. We conclude that primary cutaneous aspergillosis, a rare infection, may occur at the sites of Hickman catheters in immunocompromised patients, and that it is a serious complication requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Molecular analysis of the short arm of chromosome 3 in small-cell and non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous studies have suggested that the loss of DNA sequences on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) is associated with small-cell lung carcinoma. We therefore looked for loss of 3p alleles in tumor tissue from 42 patients with either small-cell or non-small-cell lung carcinoma. All 13 patients with small-cell lung carcinoma who were heterozygous for one or more alleles at 3p in normal tissue had the loss of at least one codominant allele in the tumor tissue. Cell lines of small-cell lung carcinoma from an additional eight patients were homozygous for 3p alleles; this result was significantly different from the predicted frequency of homozygosity. The tumor tissue studied included cell lines of small-cell lung carcinoma obtained from biopsy specimens, an autopsy sample, and an excised lymph node containing tumor cells. Loss of alleles at 3p was observed in tumor samples obtained before and after chemotherapy. Four of 15 evaluable patients with non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung had loss of 3p alleles. We conclude that loss of alleles at 3p is a change found consistently in small-cell lung carcinoma and occasionally in non-small-cell lung carcinoma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Respiratory distress syndrome in second-born versus first-born twins. A matched case-control analysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The well-known increased risk of the respiratory distress syndrome in a twin born second as compared with the twin born first is usually attributed to the second twin's predisposition to depression at birth ("asphyxia"). We analyzed the etiologic roles of birth order, presentation, and depression at birth in the development of the respiratory distress syndrome in matched case-control populations drawn from 221 preterm twin pairs. Among the 39 twin pairs discordant for respiratory distress syndrome, the second twin was the affected member in 31 pairs. Second birth order was the only independent risk factor, but only in vaginal deliveries (matched odds ratio, 14.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 81.1). Second twins delivered abdominally did not have an increased risk relative to first twins (odds ratio, 0.9; confidence interval, 0 to 17.8). When depression at birth was evaluated as an outcome variable, malpresentation, rather than birth order, was the major risk factor (independent matched odds ratios of 2.7 [confidence interval, 1.0 to 7.5] and 1.3 [0.7 to 2.5], respectively). Thus, second twins' increased risk of respiratory distress syndrome cannot be explained by a predisposition to depression at birth; a more important factor may be that second twins do not benefit from the salutary effects of labor to the same extent as first twins.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hip fracture and the use of estrogens in postmenopausal women. The Framingham Study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess the effect of postmenopausal use of estrogens on the subsequent risk of hip fracture, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 2873 women in the Framingham Heart Study. Information obtained at routine biennial examinations about the use of estrogens, body weight, age at menopause, smoking, and alcohol consumption was used to evaluate the risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women who received estrogens. Hip fractures occurred in 179 postmenopausal women, at a rate that increased exponentially after the age of 50. The risk of fracture was inversely related to weight at all ages. The relative risk of hip fracture in subjects who had taken estrogens at any time was 0.65 after adjustment for age and weight (95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.98). The adjusted relative risk in women who had taken estrogens within the previous two years was further reduced, to 0.34 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.98). Taking estrogens within four years of menopause also protected against fracture. The number of women in each age group who took estrogens was insufficient for a definitive evaluation of risk, but recent use of estrogens appeared to be protective in women under the age of 65 (no fractures among those who took estrogens) and those 65 to 74. We cannot exclude some degree of selection bias among the women who received estrogen-replacement therapy. Nevertheless, this large cohort study supports the hypothesis that postmenopausal use of estrogens protects against subsequent hip fracture in women.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Aspartame and susceptibility to headache.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We performed a double-blind crossover trial of challenges with 30 mg of aspartame per kilogram of body weight or placebo in 40 subjects who reported having headaches repeatedly after consuming products containing aspartame. The incidence rate of headache after aspartame (35 percent) was not significantly different from that after placebo (45 percent) (P less than 0.50). No serious reactions were observed, and the incidence of symptoms other than headache following aspartame was also equivalent to that after placebo. No treatment-related effects were detected in vital signs, blood pressure, or plasma concentrations of cortisol, insulin, glucagon, histamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Most of the subjects were well educated and overweight and had a family or personal history of allergic reactions. The subjects who had headaches had lower plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (P less than 0.0002) and epinephrine (P less than 0.02) just before the development of headache. We conclude that in this population, aspartame is no more likely to produce headache than placebo.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Molecular analysis of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation in malignant lymphomas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One of the most common karyotypic abnormalities is the t(14;18) translocation, which is found in many lymphomas that have a characteristic follicular morphology. Recent molecular studies have shown that this chromosomal translocation results in the juxtaposition of the candidate proto-oncogene bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia-lymphoma) on chromosome 18 with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14. However, because performing accurate cytogenetic studies in solid hematolymphoid neoplasms is difficult, knowledge of the prevalence of the t(14;18) translocation and, by association, the extent of bcl-2 involvement in human lymphomas is limited. We used a number of chromosome-18 DNA probes to analyze various subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and test for structural abnormalities near or within the bcl-2 gene. Molecular features of the t(14;18) translocation were found in virtually all follicular neoplasms and about 28 percent of diffuse large-cell lymphomas. No changes in bcl-2 were found in several other subtypes of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including those previously suggested to originate from follicular-center cells and those about which cytogenetic data have been difficult to obtain. Our findings suggest a close pathogenetic relation between bcl-2 and a large group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, both with and without a follicular morphology. The methods employed in this study may be useful in improving the accuracy of diagnosis and subclassification of malignant lymphomas.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Endstopped neurons in the visual cortex as a substrate for calculating curvature.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Neurons in the visual cortex typically respond selectively to the orientation, and velocity and direction of movement, of moving-bar stimuli. These responses are generally thought to provide information about the orientation and position of lines and edges in the visual field. Some cells are also endstopped, that is selective for bars of specific lengths. Hubel and Wiesel first observed that endstopped hypercomplex cells could respond to curved stimuli and suggested they might be involved in detection of curvature, but the exact relationship between endstopping and curvature has never been determined. We present here a mathematical model relating endstopping to curvature in which the difference in response of two simple cells gives rise to endstopping and varies in proportion to curvature. We also provide physiological evidence that endstopped cells in area 17 of the cat visual cortex are selective for curvature, whereas non-endstopped cells are not, and that some are selective for the sign of curvature. The prevailing view of edge and curve determination is that orientations are selected locally by the class of simple cortical cells and then integrated to form global curves. We have developed a computational theory of orientation selection which shows that measurements of orientation obtained by simple cells are not sufficient because there will be strong, incorrect responses from cells whose receptive fields (RFs) span distinct curves (Fig. 1). If estimates of curvature are available, however, these inappropriate responses can be eliminated. Curvature provides the key to structuring the network that underlies our theory and distinguishes it from previous lateral inhibition schemes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3p markers in small-cell lung cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Specific chromosomal deletions sometimes associated with tumours such as retinoblastoma (chromosome 13q14) and Wilm's tumour (chromosome 11p13) have led to the hypothesis that recessive genes may be involved in tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is supported by demonstration of allele loss specific for these regions using polymorphic DNA markers and by the isolation of a complementary DNA clone for the retinoblastoma gene. A cytogenetic deletion in chromosome 3 (p14-p23) was reported in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) by Whang-Peng et al. At least one homologue of chromosome 3 was affected in the majority of SCLC tumours; however, the multiple chromosomal changes seen presented the possibility that chromosome 3 was rearranged, not deleted. We used polymorphic DNA probes for chromosome 3p and compared tumour and constitutional genotypes of nine SCLC patients. Our data show loss of alleles of chromosome 3p markers in tumour DNA of all nine patients supporting the hypothesis that this region contributes to tumorigenesis in SCLC.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The 5S gene internal control region is B-form both free in solution and in a complex with TFIIIA.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Rhodes and Klug have recently proposed that the internal control region of the Xenopus 5S RNA gene adopts an A-type DNA structure in solution. This suggestion was based on a Fourier analysis of both the spacing of DNase I cutting sites and on the distribution of G residues in the DNA sequence. Both revealed a approximately 5.6-5.7-base periodicity which the authors interpreted as a structural repeat every half helical turn of A-type DNA. This contention was strengthened by the finding that a 9-base-pair (bp) double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide corresponding to residues +81 to +89 of the 5S gene exhibits an A' RNA-like crystal structure. This region of DNA is of special interest as it forms the binding site for the 5S gene-specific transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA). TFIIIA is a Zn2+-binding protein which interacts with both the internal control region of the gene and the 5S transcript. As base-paired regions of RNA are of the A type, it was reasonable to postulate that 5S DNA might also adopt this conformation. We report here that the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of a synthetic 54-bp deoxyoligonucleotide corresponding to the TFIIIA binding site is similar to the CD spectrum of B-form DNA in solution. Further, DNA-TFIIIA complexes show an unaltered DNA CD component indicating no gross alteration in DNA structure on protein binding.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Can the product of the theta gene be a real globin?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A new member (theta 1, or psi alpha) of the alpha-globin gene family has recently been identified in a number of species. In higher primates the theta 1 gene has all the structural features apparently necessary for expression, and it appears to have long been under strong selective constraints which suggests that it could still be, or recently have been, a functional gene. No corresponding 'globin' has yet been identified, however. In some other species, galago and rabbit for example, the theta 1 and psi alpha genes have accumulated enough inactivating mutations for them to be considered genuine pseudogenes. Horses also have an alpha-like gene (psi alpha), in a 3' position identical to the other species in relation to the functional alpha genes, and this also appears to have the elements required for a functional gene. The predicted amino-acid sequence, however, suggests that any 'globin' product is likely to be non-viable because it has a number of seriously deleterious amino-acid replacements. Some of these amino-acid changes are shared with the rabbit and primate sequences, indicating that they predate the mammalian radiation, and that if indeed any of these genes are still functional, they are unlikely to be making haemoglobin.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cancer near nuclear installations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The OPCS report on cancer incidence and mortality in the vicinity of nuclear installations in England and Wales provides a mass of information that is so large that it should be possible to detect quite small changes in disease levels with considerable confidence. The data on cancer mortality are less subject to selective bias than the registration data on which incidence rates are based, and they provide the firmest grounds on which evidence of any effect can be obtained. These data show conclusively that there has been no general increase in cancer mortality in the vicinity of nuclear installations in a 22-year period beginning several years after the opening of the installations that have released the largest amounts of radionuclides to the environment. On the contrary, the mortality from cancer has tended to be lower in the LAAs in the vicinity of nuclear installations than in control LAAs selected for their presumed comparability with the former. This is unlikely to be due to a protective effect of ionizing radiation and suggests that, despite the efforts that were made to choose comparable control areas, there were non-installation differences between the populations relevant to the risk of dying from one or other type of cancer. Detailed examination of the few types of cancer that were relatively more common in the installation areas suggest that several of the differences were most likely to be due to chance, diagnostic artefacts or social factors rather than to any hazard specifically related to the installations. One disease provides a possible exception: namely, leukaemia in the age group 0-24 years. Two other diseases need further investigation, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease in the older age group 25-74 years. The excess mortality rates recorded from these cancers were not large, and it has yet to be established that they are not due to general confounding by other environmental or socio-economic factors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evidence for a genetic aetiology in reading disability of twins.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Reading disability (dyslexia) is a major social, educational, and mental health problem. Although estimates of prevalence vary, up to 10-15% of school-age children have severe reading deficits in spite of average intelligence and adequate educational opportunity. That reading disability may have a constitutional basis has long been recognized, and results of twin and family studies suggest that one or more of its forms may be heritable; however, definitive evidence for a genetic aetiology has not been reported. Establishing a heritable basis for reading disability could suggest possible causes, give improved risk estimates, facilitate early diagnosis, and provide validity tests for ostensible subtypes. In this report, we apply a recently developed multiple regression analysis to data collected from a sample of 64 pairs of identical twins and 55 pairs of fraternal twins, in which at least one member of the pairs is reading disabled, and present evidence for a significant genetic aetiology.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antibody production to the nucleocapsid and envelope of the hepatitis B virus primed by a single synthetic T cell site.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The nucleocapsid (HBcAg) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can induce antibody responses via both a T-cell dependent and a T-cell independent pathway and is highly immunogenic during infection. We have examined the T-cell determinants of the antigen and find that HBcAg-specific helper T cells (TH) can help B cells produce antibody against envelope (HBsAg) antigens as well as HBcAg, even though these antigens are found on separate molecules. We have also been able to prime helper T cells with synthetic T-cell epitopes of HBcAg; helper cells primed with a single synthetic epitope can induce B cells to produce antibody that reacts with multiple HBsAg epitopes. One problem with the development of an HBV vaccine is that some vaccinees and patients do not respond to HBsAg directly; our results indicate that this problem can be circumvented using the response to HBcAg.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The gene for theta-globin is transcribed in human fetal erythroid tissues.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A new gene like the alpha-globin gene has been identified in higher primates at the 3' end of the alpha-globin gene cluster. There is some controversy as to whether this gene, theta, is a functional globin gene or a non-functional pseudogene. The high degree of sequence conservation displayed by theta between primates and various mammals, such as horse and rabbit, suggests that this gene is functional in some species. Furthermore, theta encodes a 141-amino-acid polypeptide in sequence similar to alpha-globin and appears to possess functional RNA-processing signals. But the promoter region of theta is unlike the other globin genes because its CCAAT and ATA box sequences are displaced from the coding sequence by the insertion of a 200-base-pair GC-rich sequence. We demonstrate here the presence of theta-globin messenger RNA in human fetal erythroid tissue, but not in adult erythroid or other non-erythroid tissues. Furthermore, theta-globin mRNA is detectable in significant amounts in a human erythroleukaemic cell line. These results predict that theta-globin protein will be found in the early stages of human fetal development. Surprisingly, the promoter sequence of theta-globin does not correspond to the CCAAT and ATA box sequences of the gene but rather lies within the adjacent GC-rich sequence, resulting in a heterogeneous series of mRNA 5' ends 50-10 base pairs to 5' of the initiation codon. This type of promoter is reminiscent of that found in housekeeping genes such as adenine deaminase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Germline mosaicism and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mutations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked neuromuscular disease with an incidence of approximately 1 in 3,500 newborn boys. The DMD locus has a high mutation frequency: one third of the cases is thought to result from a new mutation. Linkage studies using probes to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms and DNA deletion studies have greatly improved DMD carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. Here we report on two families in which a pERT87 (DXS164) deletion was transmitted to more than one offspring by women who showed no evidence for the mutation in their own somatic (white blood) cells. We also show that the deletion in both siblings in one of the families is identical, indicating that the deletion must have occurred during mitosis in early germline proliferation, leading to a germline mosaicism. This phenomenon may turn out to be a major factor contributing to the induction of DMD mutations, and has important implications for the counselling of DMD families.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A partial deletion of the muscular dystrophy gene transmitted twice by an unaffected male.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A gene of unknown function located in band Xp21 on the short arm of the human X chromosome gives rise to X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy, of either Duchenne or Becker type, when mutated. The gene encodes a large muscle-specific transcript of about 14 kilobases (kb) and its genomic size extends over more than 1,800 kb. The high mutation rate (about 10(-4) per generation) is likely to result from the large target size. Submicroscopic deletions, detectable with one or more of the dozen cloned DNA probes available for regions within the gene, constitute a significant proportion of the mutations. Because no such deletions have been found in normal individuals, it is assumed that intragenic deletions are the molecular basis of the mutations. The origin of deletions can be traced in families. With sufficient data collected, it will soon be possible to answer questions about the relative frequencies of mutations in male and female gametogenesis and about the timing of mutational events in mitotic or meiotic stages of germ cell development. We have studied a four generation family containing males who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy due to deletion of the sequence recognized by intragenic probe J-Bir. The deletion was present in two of five daughters of a woman who herself did not have the deletion. Haplotype analysis on 15 members of this family using nine informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers indicated that the J-Bir deletion chromosome was transmitted from the unaffected father.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Stabilization of charges on isolated ionic groups sequestered in proteins by polarized peptide units.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Electrostatic interactions are of considerable importance in protein structure and function, and in a variety of cellular and biochemical processes. Here we report three similar findings from highly refined atomic structures of periplasmic binding proteins. Hydrogen bonds, acting primarily through backbone peptide units, are mainly responsible for the involvement of the positively charged arginine 151 residue in the ligand site of the arabinose-binding protein, for the association between teh sulphate-binding protein and the completely buried sulphate dianion, and for the formation of the complex of the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein with the leucine zwitterion. We propose a general mechanism in which the isolated charges on the various buried, desolvated ionic groups are stabilized by the polarized peptide units. This mechanism also has broad application to processes requiring binding of uncompensated ions and charged ligands and stabilization of enzyme reaction charged intermediates, as well as activation of catalytic residues.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Macrophage-induced angiogenesis is mediated by tumour necrosis factor-alpha.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Macrophages are important in the induction of new blood vessel growth during wound repair, inflammation and tumour growth. We show here that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a secretory product of activated macrophages that is believed to mediate tumour cytotoxicity, is a potent inducer of new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). In vivo, TNF-alpha induces capillary blood vessel formation in the rat cornea and the developing chick chorioallantoic membrane at very low doses. In vitro, TNF-alpha stimulates chemotaxis of bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells and induces cultures of these cells grown on type-1 collagen gels to form capillary-tube-like structures. The angiogenic activity produced by activated murine peritoneal macrophages is completely neutralized by a polyclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, suggesting immunological features are common to TNF-alpha and the protein responsible for macrophage-derived angiogenic activity. In inflammation and wound repair, TNF-alpha could augment repair by stimulating new blood vessel growth; in tumours, TNF-alpha might both stimulate tumour development by promoting vessel growth and participate in tumour destruction by direct cytotoxicity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Location of the ATPase site of myosin determined by three-dimensional electron microscopy [published erratum appears in Nature 1987 Nov 26-Dec 2;330(6146):404]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Both ATP hydrolysis by myosin and the accompanying cyclic association-dissociation of actin and myosin are essential for muscle contraction. It is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of contraction to know the three-dimensional locations of the two major functional sites of myosin: the ATPase site and the actin-binding site. We have determined the position of the ATPase site of myosin using three-dimensional image reconstruction from electron micrographs and site-specific labelling with the avidin-biotin system. The ATPase site is about 5 nm from the tip of the myosin head and is about 4 nm away from the actin-binding site of myosin. This is the first report of the three-dimensional location of an enzyme active site by electron microscopy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Direct detection of more than 50% of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy mutations by field inversion gels.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder affecting about 1 in 3,500 males. It is allelic with the milder Becker muscular dystrophy. The biochemical basis for both diseases is unknown and no effective treatment is available. Long-range physical mapping has shown that the DMD gene, localized in Xp21, is extremely large, exceeding 2 million base pairs. Until now, carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis has involved the use of linked restriction fragment length polymorphism markers which detect muscular dystrophy-associated deletions in about 10% of the cases. Field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) allows the detection of structural rearrangements in 21 out of 39 of the DMD patients studied (54%), of which 14 (65%) were not detected by conventional methods. Large deletions seem to make up a much higher fraction of the DMD mutations than so far indicated by other methods. A region prone to deletion was located in the distal half of the gene. FIGE analysis could provide a valuable extension of information for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. The technique should be generally applicable to the study of diseases involving structural chromosomal rearrangements.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein associated with DNA binding activity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The human gene (RB) that determines susceptibility to hereditary retinoblastoma has been identified recently by molecular genetic techniques. Previous results indicate that complete inactivation of the RB gene is required for tumour formation. As a 'cancer suppressor' gene, RB thus functions in a manner opposite to that of most other oncogenes. Sequence analysis of RB complementary DNA clones demonstrated a long open reading frame encoding a hypothetical protein with features suggestive of a DNA-binding function. To further substantiate and identify the RB protein, we have prepared rabbit antisera against a trypE-RB fusion protein. The purified anti-RB IgG immunoprecipitates a protein doublet with apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of 110,000-114,000. The specific protein(s) are present in all cell lines expressing normal RB mRNA, but are not detected in five retinoblastoma cell lines examined. The RB protein can be metabolically labelled with 32P-phosphoric acid, indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that the majority of the protein is located within the nucleus. Furthermore, the protein can be retained by and eluted from DNA-cellulose columns, suggesting that it is associated with DNA binding activity. Taken together, these results imply that the RB gene product may function in regulating other genes within the cell.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chromosomal localization of the human rhabdomyosarcoma locus by mitotic recombination mapping.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A genetic description of the human genome requires maps of three types. The first shows the frequency of chromosomal interchange during meiosis, relying on many equally spaced markers, and is limited to interchanges that do not unmask defects lethal to the conceptus, whose every cell will contain such abnormalities. The second is the physical description of genomic regions defined by karyotypic rearrangements, DNA segments, genes, or their products. A third description of somatic chromosomal interchanges at mitosis is also required. Because mitotic exchanges occur in a single postembryonic somatic progenitor cell, lethal effects on the organism are reduced. These events have been important in genetic mapping in Drosophila melanogaster and fungi, but they have rarely been detected in mammals. Here we report a significant frequency of mitotic recombination in human tumours and the first application of this information in localizing their predisposing locus.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Multiple cis- and trans-acting elements mediate the transcriptional response to phorbol esters.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Protein kinase C is important in the transduction of signals generated at the plasma membrane. The physiological activators of protein kinase C are diacylglycerols, and the tumour-promoting phorbol esters, such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-14 acetate (TPA), constitute another group of specific activators. Many cellular substrates for phosphorylation by protein kinase C have been described, but proteins that directly control transcription in response to protein kinase C activation are yet to be identified. TPA treatment leads to induction of various proto-oncogenes, growth factor genes, and genes encoding secreted proteases. In addition. TPA increases the activity of viral enhancer elements. To identify trans-acting factors that mediate the transcriptional response to TPA we chose the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer as a model, because it is known to be composed of several discrete cis-acting elements which are recognized by multiple transacting factors. We report here that the SV40 enhancer contains at least four different TPA responsive elements whose activity is dependent on cell-type. The induction response is likely to involve at least two distinct post-translational steps which modulate the activity of the proteins that recognize these elements.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Preliminary report: effects of high dose methylprednisolone on delayed cerebral ischemia in patients at high risk for vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Mounting evidence suggests that chronic cerebral vasospasm may be linked to the inflammatory response that follows subarachnoid hemorrhage. Twenty-one patients judged to be at high risk for vasospasm because of either poor admitting grade or a large amount of subarachnoid blood shown by computed tomography were treated with a course of high dose methylprednisolone, and management results were compared to those of a cohort of contemporary control patients matched for grade, number of hemorrhages, time from hemorrhage to admission, time from hemorrhage to operation, aneurysm location, age, and sex. Patients treated with high dose methylprednisolone were twice as likely to have an excellent result and half as likely to die as those who were not treated. The incidence and severity of delayed cerebral ischemia were reduced in treated patients when compared to control patients. None of the treated patients developed a serious side effect that could be attributed to steroid treatment. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that chronic vasospasm is an inflammatory vasculopathy and suggest that early treatment with high dose methylprednisolone may benefit this high risk group of patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mechanism of vascular responsiveness to barbiturates in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We inserted stainless steel cannulae to compare vascular responses to five kinds of barbiturates and to investigate the mechanism of vascular responsiveness to thiopental in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries. Intraluminal thiopental (10 to 3000 micrograms) usually caused a distinctly biphasic vascular response, i.e., initial vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation. The vasoconstriction was always greater than the vasodilatation in percentage of change. Thiamylal (10 to 3000 micrograms) evoked similar vascular responses. Pentobarbital, phenobarbital, and amobarbital (100 to 3000 micrograms) induced slight monophasic vasodilatation in lower doses and a weak biphasic response in higher doses. Pretreatment with phentolamine and ketanserin, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist and a 5-hydroxytryptamine2 inhibitor, did not alter vasoconstriction to thiopental. Increasing doses of pretreatment with diltiazem, a potent calcium antagonist, depressed the vasoconstriction induced by potassium chloride in a dose-related manner, but thiopental-induced constriction was only slightly suppressed by diltiazem treatment. Endothelial removal produced by intraluminal saponin treatment significantly enhanced vasoconstriction to potassium chloride, but thiopental-induced constriction was not enhanced significantly after saponin treatment. These findings suggest that thiopental-induced vasoconstriction does not involve adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms and is due to intracellular movement of calcium ions in canine basilar arteries.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Computed tomographic evaluation of extracranial carotid artery disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Axial computed tomographic (CT) scans after intravenous contrast infusion were used to image the cervical carotid arteries of patients with cerebral ischemic symptoms. Standard transfemoral cervical carotid and cerebral angiography was the principal diagnostic modality used in all patients studied. The angiographic results were compared to the CT images and to the gross and microscopic endarterectomy pathological specimens, when available. Examples of the various types of abnormalities that can be visualized using CT scans are presented. The CT scan was useful for determining the presence of degenerative atheromatous changes including carotid artery calcification, subintimal hemorrhage, carotid occlusion, carotid segmental occlusion, and carotid pseudoocclusion, as well as carotid artery dissection. The scans were particularly useful for identification of atheromatous carotid artery disease when the carotid angiogram appeared nearly normal and for identifying the cause of postoperative carotid stenosis. CT scanning allows visualization of the carotid artery wall and lumen rather than just the lumen and, consequently, can sometimes add helpful information about the pathological processes affecting this artery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Moderate hypothermia reduces postischemic edema development and leukotriene production.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Using the bilateral carotid artery occlusion model of cerebral ischemia in the gerbil, we studied the effect of moderate hypothermia (30 to 31 degrees C) on the postischemic production of prostanoids (cyclooxygenase pathway) and leukotrienes (lipoxygenase pathway) and accompanying changes in cerebral edema formation. Hypothermia capable of slowing central evoked potential conduction time was studied over the course of 40 minutes of cerebral ischemia and for up to 2 hours of reperfusion. The successful induction of cerebral ischemia was confirmed by somatosensory evoked potential amplitude changes. Measurements of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (radioimmunoassay) and cerebral edema (specific gravity) were made at early (10 minutes) and late (2 hours) reperfusion times. Although both white and gray matter showed no early significant difference in edema accumulation between normothermic and hypothermic gerbils at 10 minutes of reperfusion, hypothermic animals demonstrated significantly less white matter edema (specific gravity, 1.0397 +/- 0.0010 vs. 1.0341 +/- 0.0012, P less than 0.01) and gray matter edema (specific gravity, 1.0408 +/- 0.0009 vs. 1.0365 +/- 0.0008, P less than 0.01) by 2 hours of reperfusion. Production of PGF1 alpha was not significantly different between normothermic and hypothermic animals during the reperfusion period; however, hypothermic gerbils demonstrated significantly lower production of LTB4 at 10 minutes reperfusion time compared to normothermic animals (1.49 +/- 0.79 vs. 5.28 +/- 1.49 pg/mg of protein, P less than 0.05). This difference between the two groups in LTB4 levels was no longer detectable at 2 hours of reperfusion time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of intraventricularly injected isoosmolar glycerol on brain water and electrolytes in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The infusion of isoosmolar glycerol (0.35 mol/dm-3) into the ventricles of laboratory rats for 120 minutes led to an increase in the serum osmolality by 11 mosm/kg and to hypernatremia. The brain water content of the cerebral hemispheres decreased by 0.9% (P less than 0.05). A corresponding intraventricular infusion of saline or d-glucose did not cause significant changes in these parameters. These findings support the view that glycerol, even in a dose incapable of creating a major osmotic gradient between plasma and brain, could have a beneficial effect in the control of intracranial volume-pressure perturbations. It is hypothesized that, besides acting as an osmotic dehydrating agent in certain concentrations, glycerol influences the central neuroendocrine system responsible for brain ion and volume homeostasis. By its presumed reduction of central and peripheral vasopressin release through lowering the cerebrospinal fluid sodium concentration, it may help in decreasing the brain water content.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Three-dimensional computed tomography in the diagnosis of vertebral column pathological conditions.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three-dimensional computed tomographic scanning is a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis and treatment of disease processes involving the spine. We present our experience with this noninvasive radiological diagnostic technique in 32 patients with vertebral column abnormalities ranging from craniovertebral junction disorders to fractures of lumbar vertebrae. The three-dimensional CT images often demonstrate pathological conditions and occult lesions that are not adequately defined by conventional radiographic means.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pulmonary complications of acute spinal cord injuries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The records of 123 consecutive patients admitted with spinal cord injury were examined for the presence of pulmonary complications. Forty-nine had tetraplegia and 23 had paraplegia; the remainder suffered a variety of neurological deficits. Multiple injuries were encountered in 36 patients. Fifty-three pulmonary complications were noted in 44 (35.7%) patients. The most common problems were atelectasis and pneumonia. There were 22 (18%) deaths. Fourteen deaths were related to pulmonary complications. The mean age of patients who died was 52 +/- 13 (SE) compared to 28 +/- 12 for survivors. A mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1127 +/- 410 cc in patients suffering respiratory difficulties compared to a FVC of 1865 +/- 85 cc in patients without complications (P less than 0.001). Oxygenation (PaO2 90 +/- 19 torr) was normal in patients without respiratory problems and was abnormal in patients developing problems (PaO2 76 +/- 30 torr; P less than 0.05). Twenty patients were treated with a rotating bed. The complication rate of patients on the bed was only 10%. In conclusion, respiratory problems remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in spinal cord injury. The forced vital capacity, blood oxygen tension, and age are predictors of pulmonary complications. The use of a multidisciplinary approach and a rotating bed may minimize these problems.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hearing preservation after acoustic neurinoma operation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1981 and 1984, 44 patients underwent acoustic neurinoma removal by a posterior cranial fossa approach with an attempt to preserve hearing. Seven tumors were small (less than 20 mm), 28 were medium (20 to 40 mm), and 9 were large (greater than 40 mm). Preoperatively, 4 patients had normal hearing, 15 had serviceable hearing, 10 had poor hearing, and 15 had no hearing. Postoperative hearing was preserved in 11 cases. Of the 19 patients with normal or serviceable hearing, 8 (42%) had serviceable hearing preserved postoperatively. Hearing preservation was achieved in 43% of the patients with small tumors, 25% of those with medium tumors, and 11% of those with large tumors. This study confirms the value of the suboccipital approach, which can be used in an attempt to preserve hearing whenever the patient has serviceable hearing preoperatively and whenever the tumor size makes it feasible.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of the extent of surgical resection on survival and quality of life in patients with supratentorial glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-one patients operated upon for supratentorial glioblastomas or anaplastic astrocytomas were studied to evaluate the effect of the extent of surgical resection on the length and quality of survival. The median age was 50 years and the median preoperative Karnofsky rate was 80. Twenty-one patients (68%) had glioblastoma multiforme, and 10 patients (32%) had anaplastic astrocytoma. Early postoperative enhanced computed tomography was used to determine the extent of tumor resection. Gross total tumor resection was accomplished in 19 patients (61%), and subtotal resection was performed in 12 patients (39%). The two groups were comparable regarding age, sex, pathological condition, preoperative Karnofsky rating, tumor location, postoperative radiation therapy, and postoperative chemotherapy (P greater than 0.05). The gross total resection group lived longer than the subtotal resection group by life table analysis (P less than 0.001; median survival of 90 and 43 weeks, respectively). Postoperatively, the mean functional ability measured by the Karnofsky rating was significantly increased in the gross total resection group (P = 0.006), but not in the subtotal resection group (P greater than 0.05). The difference in degree of change between preoperative and postoperative Karnofsky rating in the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.002). The gross total resection group spent significantly more time after the operation in an independent status (Karnofsky rating greater than or equal to 80) compared to the subtotal resection group (P = 0.007; median time of 185 and 12.5 weeks, respectively). Gross total resection of supratentorial glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas is feasible and is directly associated with longer and better survival when compared to subtotal resection.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Combined intraarterial and systemic chemotherapy for intracerebral tumors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-six patients with intracerebral tumors (predominantly gliomas) were treated with intraarterial BCNU, VM-26, and cisplatin combined with the systemic administration of VM-26, methotrexate, vincristine, bleomycin, and procarbazine. Oral glycerol was given before i.v. VM-26. Twelve patients responded (46% of all patients and 63% of the fully evaluable patients). The response rate for gliomas was 50% if all patients were considered and 71% if only fully evaluable patients were considered. The response rate did not seem to be affected by glioma grade, prior chemotherapy, or pretreatment performance status. Median time to tumor progression for responders was 19 weeks. Median survival from initiation of treatment was 21 weeks for evaluable patients and 17 weeks for all patients. Median survival from initial diagnosis was 55 weeks. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting for the systemic chemotherapy. Reversible neurological toxicity was common, but tolerable. One patient developed ipsilateral blindness, and two patients developed prolonged neurological toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity was also seen. Vertebral artery infusions proved feasible, although difficult and more toxic than carotid infusions. Overall, this regimen was not more active than the intraarterial combination of BCNU, VM-26, and cisplatin without the systemic chemotherapy. Further studies of more intensive intracarotid therapy combined with different systemic drugs are being initiated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fascicular ligation in the prevention and treatment of painful terminal neuroma: an experimental study in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The role of microfascicular double ligation and interligature coagulation in the prevention of painful neuroma was studied in an experimental model of section of the sciatic nerve in the rat. The experimental parameters used were the onset of autotomy and the weekly autotomy score. The autotomy of the denervated limb is a behavioral pattern that occurs in the experimental animal after the severing of peripheral nerves and has been related to anomalous electrical activity originating from the neuroma. Microfascicular ligation was performed immediately after section of the sciatic nerve or 10 days later. The results were compared to those of control groups treated with simple nerve section or simple neuroma resection 10 days after nerve section. The results show that immediate or delayed microfascicular ligation has no effect on pain as measured by the development of autotomy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long term results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in patients with Cushing's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- As part of an ongoing series, 100 patients with Cushing's disease underwent transsphenoidal operations. Pituitary adenomas were confirmed in 93 patients, and initial remission was achieved in 86 (92%) of them. Hypercortisolemia was not corrected in 7 patients, and in 4 this was due to invasive adenomas. These patients were subjected to irradiation, medical treatment, or both after operation. Only 7 of the 100 patients had no pituitary adenoma found at operation, and they obtained no clinical remission even after partial or subtotal hypophysectomy. Follow-up review, with an emphasis on endocrinological studies, was performed on these patients for a mean period of 38 months. Seventy-eight patients were in long term remission after operation and had restoration of noncorticotropic hormone secretion as well as pituitary-adrenal function. Recurrence was noted in 8 patients after 19 to 82 months in remission. In all of these patients, pituitary adenomas were verified by reoperation and no case of corticotrophic cell hyperplasia was noted. We conclude that late recurrence of Cushing's disease may occur after adenoma removal and is due to the regrowth of adenoma cells left behind in the peritumoral tissue at the first operation. In view of the overall remission rate, transsphenoidal adenomectomy is considered a highly effective treatment for Cushing's disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cushing's syndrome caused by an ectopic pituitary adenoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 49-year old woman with a 5-year history of Cushing's syndrome was evaluated. Biochemical measurements revealed high cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels consistent with the ACTH-dependent type of Cushing's syndrome. However, the source of ACTH seemed to be autonomous as she demonstrated abnormal feedback control, with lack of response to metyrapone and high coses of dexamethasone. A search for an ectopic ACTH-secreting nonpituitary neoplasm was unsuccessful. Transsphenoidal pituitary exploration revealed a normal pituitary gland, but an ectopic pituitary adenoma was found incidentally in the mucosa of the sphenoid sinus. This adenoma stained strongly positive for ACTH on immunocytochemical studies. Resection of this lesion led to remission of the Cushing's syndrome. This variant of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome can mimic the ectopic ACTH-dependent type and should be looked for in patients who fail to respond to pituitary operation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Demyelinating disease of corpus callosum presenting as glioma on magnetic resonance scan: a case documented with pathological findings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved the diagnosis of several pathological entities of the brain. MRI especially has been credited with distinguishing demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system from other diseases. The presence of a mass effect in a demyelinating disorder, however, makes difficult the distinction between tumor and a demyelinating disease. We report a case of a demyelinating disorder simulating an infiltrating glioma of the corpus callosum on MRI scan, resulting in surgical intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported with MRI and documented pathological findings.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The sensitivity and specificity of MRI in stroke.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We compared MRI and CT in a study of 175 patients; 87 infarcts within a week, 40 from 1 to 40 weeks, 25 a year after onset, and 23 hemorrhages, 18 within 2 weeks and 5 in 4 to 8 weeks. Fifty-nine infarcts and eight hemorrhages had sequential scanning. MRI is more sensitive than CT in the early detection of cerebral infarcts. CT is the method of choice to rule out intracerebral bleeding, but MRI is more specific in later stages of hemorrhage. Periventricular hyperintensity is seen more frequently with diabetes than without. Hyperintense white matter patches are often unrelated to clinical events. MRI is useful in following the evolution of strokes and distinguishing acute and chronic infarcts without contrast agents.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Predicting cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: influences of clinical condition, CT results, and antifibrinolytic therapy. A report of the Cooperative Aneurysm Study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cerebral ischemia from vasospasm is a major cause of death and disability following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study examines and compares the relative utility of the initial neurologic examination and early CT in predicting cerebral ischemia after SAH. The influence of antifibrinolytic drugs (AFD) in the development of cerebral ischemia was also studied. AFD increased the risk of cerebral ischemia regardless of the admitting neurologic condition or the findings of CT. Among patients given AFD, impaired orientation or alertness was associated with a higher risk of ischemia. Other neurologic signs were not predictive of ischemia. Clinical features were not predictive of ischemia among patients not given AFD. Focal, thick collections of blood on CT were highly predictive of ischemia, whether or not patients received AFD. Admitting CT is the best prognostic indicator for the development of cerebral ischemia after SAH. It should be used to supplement the clinical examination in selecting patients best suited for therapy to prevent vasospasm.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We measured mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 25 lupus patients using the xenon-133 method. The CBF was normal in lupus patients without cerebral disease and also in CNS lupus patients in remission. The CBF was lower than normal during bouts of cerebral lupus (p less than 0.001). Repeat studies showed a stereotyped pattern consisting of depressed CBF during exacerbation of CNS disease and normalization of CBF during remission (p less than 0.01). These results show that CBF is a sensitive indicator of activity of CNS disease and that the direction of change in CBF reflects the clinical course of CNS lupus.</ABSTRACT>

Sixteen aphasic subjects showed cerebellar symmetry. Twenty-one aphasic subjects were found to have cerebellar metabolic asymmetry, which (1) resulted from an absolute reduction in local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose in the right cerebellar hemisphere; (2) was associated with left less than right glucose metabolic asymmetry in the frontal, parietal, caudate, and thalamic regions; (3) was associated with Broca's region and deep hemisphere structural damage to the internal capsule and basal ganglia; (4) related to reduced functional motor performance, spontaneous speech, naming, reading, and writing; and (5) included all Broca's aphasia subjects.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Sixteen patients with Parkinson's disease and therapeutic response fluctuations entered an open-label trial of a controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa preparation, Sinemet CR4. Sinemet CR4 behaved as a slow release preparation. At the end of 6 weeks CR4 treatment, there was an increase in percent "on" time and mean interdose interval; the number of daily doses and "off" periods were diminished and a slight reduction in the variability of plasma levodopa levels was observed. Overall benefit waned over the next 6 months, despite addition of standard levodopa or Sinemet to overcome the delayed onset of antiparkinsonian effect of CR4 which resulted from prolongation in the Tmax for levodopa. The major benefits of CR4 were reduction in off time and in the number of daily off periods, with fewer levodopa doses per day and prolongation of the interdose interval.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The risk of automobile accidents with seizures occurring while driving: relation to seizure type.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Automobile accidents occurred with 55% of seizures in epileptic drivers with both well-described seizures at the wheel and a well-classified epilepsy diagnosis. A further 38% of seizures would have led to accidents in less fortunate settings. Complex partial seizures occurred in 81% of patients and were responsible for 88% of accidents. Immediate alterations of consciousness were significantly more likely to lead to accidents than were seizures beginning with an aura. Motor activity during simple partial seizures was also responsible for some accidents. Differences in seizure frequency may account for different crude accident rates among studies of epileptic drivers. We suggest guidelines for licensing restrictions that seem safe and reasonable.</ABSTRACT>

The focus was in the hemisphere opposite the direction of head or eye turning in more than 90% of patients. Ipsiversive movements were more likely to occur with temporal foci and were never found with occipital foci. Maintenance of awareness during versive movements indicated a contralateral focus in 100% and origin from the frontal lobe in 93%; a temporal focus was more likely if awareness was not maintained. Ictal versive movements, if unequivocal, consistent, and forced, are of reliable lateralizing and localizing value.</ABSTRACT>

In the 24 months following onset of treatment, 223 patients failed treatment. Analysis of these failures reveals that the majority occurred during the first 6 months with equal contributions to failure from systemic toxicity, neurotoxicity, and seizures. The contribution of systemic toxicity to failure was significantly less in the next 18 months. An increase in the contribution of seizures to failure was seen in this latter period.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- ECG abnormalities in patients with epilepsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Some investigators believe that patients with epilepsy are at increased risk of sudden death, perhaps because of cardiac arrhythmias. We studied 338 patients with epilepsy referred for simultaneous ambulatory EEG/ECG monitoring. High-risk cardiac arrhythmias were detected in 18 (5.3%) patients while low-risk arrhythmias or negative studies were found in the others. Fifty-six electrographic seizures were seen in 17 patients, but no associated ventricular arrhythmias or conduction defects were identified. We conclude that the incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmias predisposing to sudden death is not increased in patients with epilepsy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Clinical outcome after complete or partial cortical resection for intractable epilepsy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This is the first epilepsy surgery series to analyze the definition of "completeness" of resection, based solely on results of chronic scalp and subdural EEG recording. When patients had complete removal of all cortical areas with ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges, the clinical outcome was usually good. When areas with epileptiform discharges were left behind, good outcome was significantly less frequent. This correlation between complete resection and good outcome was independent of the presence or absence of CT-detected structural lesions or sharp waves on post-resection electrocorticography. These results support completeness of resection, defined by prolonged extraoperative EEG, as an important factor in seizure surgery.</ABSTRACT>

They had no abnormalities of visual acuity or fields to explain their defect. EOG with computer analysis showed intact motility and scanning. Most important, the subjects reported intermittent disappearance of a light target during EOG-verified fixation--ie, they were looking but not seeing. Results indicate that attention mechanisms that permit sustained awareness of visual targets depend on the superior visual association cortices and are relatively separate from mechanisms that shift gaze and drive visual search.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Predictors of disease course in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The presence of extrapyramidal signs or psychosis may indicate greater disability in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the ability of these signs, noted at a patient's first visit, to predict one of two specific clinical endpoints: (1) a preselected score on the modified Mini-Mental State examination (cognitive endpoint), and (2) a preselected score on the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (functional endpoint). Sixty-five patients were followed either until they reached the endpoints or to the end of the study period. Survivorship curves were drawn to predict the distribution of time to onset of an endpoint in patients with and without the clinical signs. Time to reach the cognitive endpoint was shorter for patients with extrapyramidal signs or psychosis compared with those without these signs and symptoms. These clinical signs did not predict the functional endpoint. We conclude that extrapyramidal signs and psychosis may be useful predictors of intellectual decline in Alzheimer's disease.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We present four patients, two pairs of siblings, with glutaric aciduria type I (GA I). All four had undetectable glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity on fibroblast culture and massive urinary excretion of glutaric acid. All had serum carnitine deficiency at time of diagnosis except one patient who was diagnosed neonatally. All had a unique pattern of frontotemporal atrophy on CT. Remarkably, in both sibling pairs, one child was asymptomatic. This suggests that the biochemical markers hitherto identified with GA I do not encompass the entire scope of the metabolic or enzymatic abnormalities. Alternatively, as yet unidentified mechanisms might spare or delay the destructive process.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A prevalence survey on Parkinson's disease (PD) was performed in the Republic of San Marino, which is the smallest independent state in the world, and is located near the Adriatic coast, within Italy. On April 30, 1986, it had a population of 22,322. We found 34 cases of PD (17 men, 17 women). Crude prevalence ratio per 100,000 population was 152 (154 for men, 150 for women) with an age-adjusted ratio of 185 (both sexes). This study shows that the prevalence of PD in the Mediterranean area of South Europe is similar to that in North Europe and the United States.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nuchal cords and neonatal outcome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess the significance of nuchal cords, 110 affected woman-infant pairs at term gestation were compared with 110 control pairs. Newborns with a nuchal cord had an increased prevalence of umbilical artery acidemia (22 of 110 versus 13 of 110; P less than .05) and more variable fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations in the first stage of labor (mild = 41 versus 20; P less than .0001; moderate-severe = 21 versus 5; P less than .0001) and the second stage of labor (moderate-severe = 46 versus 21; P less than .0001). In newborns with a nuchal cord, the umbilical artery acidemia was usually mixed (68%) or respiratory (23%) in origin, and pure metabolic acidemia was infrequent (9%). We conclude that nuchal cords are associated with an increased prevalence of variable FHR decelerations in the first and second stages of labor and with an increased incidence of umbilical artery acidemia.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate, a disease of unknown etiology, is associated with a mortality rate as high as 50%. We conducted a retrospective study (1979-1983) to identify antenatal events that may be associated with this disease. Thirty-seven mothers of neonates with this disorder were compared with 150 randomly selected control patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that meconium, maternal fever (caused by urinary tract infection, upper respiratory infection, chorioamnionitis, and unknown causes), maternal anemia (caused by abruptio placentae, placenta previa, and unknown causes), and maternal pulmonary disease (caused by asthma and/or pneumonia) were associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate. The computed odds ratios for the variables associated with this disease were increased significantly above the controls. In addition, cesarean section, nonvertex presentation, fetal distress, and vaginal bleeding were found to be significant on univariate analyses. The cesarean section rate in the study group was 59%, with the primary indications of fetal distress and/or third-trimester bleeding in 77.3% of instances. These data suggest that antenatal risk factors and the computed odds ratio may help identify pregnancies likely to produce infants at high risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antepartum ambulatory tocodynamometry: the significance of low-amplitude, high-frequency contractions.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical significance of low-amplitude, high-frequency contractions was examined during pregnancy in 142 women who underwent daily ambulatory tocodynamometry between 23-36 weeks' gestation. The results indicate that patients destined to develop preterm labor had this contractility pattern significantly more often than did their counterparts who delivered at term (13.5 versus 9.2%; P less than .01). Parity and gestational age had no effect on the occurrence of low-amplitude, high-frequency contractility, but this pattern was also significantly more prevalent in the presence of multifetal gestations, independent of the occurrence of preterm labor. The institution of tocolytic therapy was accompanied by a 50% decrease in the proportion of time occupied by low-amplitude, high-frequency contractions. Although this contraction pattern occurred significantly more often among patients who later developed preterm labor, calculations of its predictive values, specificity, and sensitivity indicate that its presence has relatively limited clinical significance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgical incision for cesarean section.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ninety-seven women undergoing cesarean section were delivered through a muscle-cutting Maylard or a Pfannenstiel abdominal incision. In these two similar groups of women, the mean Maylard incision length was significantly greater (18.3 +/- 4.5 cm) than that of the Pfannenstiel incision (14.0 +/- 2.1 cm), with no difference in operative morbidity. Difficulty with infant delivery was significantly less frequent with both the Maylard and Pfannenstiel when the incision was at least 15 cm in length. These results suggest that cesarean delivery is performed optimally with an adequate surgical incision, and that the Maylard incision is a safe option which should be strongly considered when risk factors (eg, macrosomia, twins) demand maximal surgical exposure for nontraumatic abdominal delivery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Trial of labor in previous cesarean section patients, excluding classical cesarean sections.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has supported the concept of a trial of labor in patients with a previous lower uterine transverse cesarean section, and its safety is generally accepted. The purpose of this report was to present the results of a year-long, prospective study in which the indications for trial of labor were liberalized. Only patients with a previous classical incision or "T" incision on the uterus were excluded. Two hundred seventy-two patients elected to undergo a trial of labor. Vaginal delivery occurred in 216 patients (76.5%). Oxytocin was used as needed, and epidural anesthesia was used in all patients who requested it. One uterine rupture occurred in a patient with a single lower transverse scar. The results of this study suggest that a trial of labor is a safe alternative for patients with a previous single or multiple lower uterine transverse incision or a lower uterine vertical incision. In addition, the use of epidural anesthesia and oxytocin appears safe in patients undergoing a trial of labor.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Single-dose cefazolin versus cefonicid for antibiotic prophylaxis in cesarean delivery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this prospective investigation was to compare a single intravenous dose of cefazolin to a single dose of cefonicid as prophylaxis for women having unscheduled cesarean delivery. In a double-blind, randomized design, 96 patients were assigned to receive a 1-g dose of cefazolin and 103 patients were designated to receive a 1-g dose of cefonicid. The antibiotics were administered after delivery of the infant. The two groups were comparable with respect to recognized risk factors for postcesarean infection. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of standard febrile morbidity, endomyometritis, urinary tract infection, wound infection, and bacteremia. There were also no significant differences between the groups in the fever index or the duration of hospitalization. We conclude that cefazolin and cefonicid provide a similar degree of prophylaxis against infection in patients having unscheduled cesarean delivery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Maternal and fetal factors affecting success of antepartum external cephalic version.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied 172 patients who were considered for external cephalic version with tocolysis at term. Before a single attempt at version, a variety of maternal and fetal factors considered likely to affect success were coded for each patient. Maternal age, height, and Quetelet index did not affect success. However, successful version was more likely in parous women than in nulliparous women, and less likely with cornual than with other placentations. Amniotic fluid volume, fetal abdominal circumference, type of breech, and the specific nature of the maternal-fetal spatial relation were also important determinants of success. Fetal biparietal diameter, gestational age, and estimated fetal weight were not. All of these factors can be evaluated before attempting version and can be used when counseling candidates for version.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Single-probe spectrophotometry in the assessment of fetal oxygenation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Six sheep fetuses were monitored with a single-probe tissue spectrophotometer. This spectrophotometer provides continuous digital output of the index of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen. To vary the fetal pO2, each maternal ewe was given room air, 100% oxygen, 12% oxygen, and 100% nitrogen via rebreathing bag. Fetal venous (N = 4) or arterial (N = 2) blood was analyzed for pO2. There was excellent correlation between the index of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen and the fetal pO2. The single-probe spectrophotometer overcomes two of the technical problems encountered when a double-probe spectrophotometer is used.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A critical evaluation of the endocervical curettage.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A prospective study was undertaken to critically evaluate the endocervical curettage. The study group consisted of 261 patients with colposcopically identifiable cervical lesions that had not been previously biopsied and were not macroscopically suspicious for invasive cancer. In 210 patients, the entire lesion, transformation zone, and squamocolumnar junction were visible (satisfactory colposcopy), and in 51 patients, the full extent of the lesion was not visualized colposcopically (unsatisfactory colposcopy). We used a method of examination not previously described. Colposcopy was performed before and after the endocervical curettage, but before the ectocervical biopsy. This method of examination allowed us to identify potentially contaminated endocervical curettages and to test the null hypothesis that a positive endocervical curettage in patients with satisfactory colposcopy is not the result of contamination. Twenty of 210 endocervical curettages in patients with satisfactory colposcopy were potentially contaminated, as suggested by an ectocervical lesion disrupted by the endocervical curettage. No patient with a positive endocervical curettage had an intact ectocervical lesion. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected (P less than .005). Of the 51 patients with unsatisfactory colposcopy, 39 (76%) underwent cone biopsy. Invasive cancer was diagnosed by cone biopsy in two patients when both ectocervical biopsy and endocervical curettage demonstrated only dysplasia. We also confirmed that patients with unsatisfactory colposcopy occasionally benefit from having an endocervical curettage. However, basing the treatment plan for any lesion short of invasive cancer solely on the results of colposcopy, ectocervical biopsy, and/or endocervical curettage could lead to significant undertreatment of some patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The screening Papanicolaou smear: contribution of the endocervical brush.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between September 1984 and February 1985, cervical cytologic smears were collected from 510 patients using a spatula and an endocervical swab. These smears were compared with those collected from 510 patients between September 1985 and February 1986 using a spatula and an endocervical brush. The use of the endocervical brush increased the number of smears that contained endocervical cells, for both reproductive-age and postmenopausal women. In women without previous radiation therapy, the rate of suboptimal smears (those without endocervical cells) fell from 12.0 to 1.7% when the endocervical brush was used. This modified smear collection technique improved the quality of the cytologic material.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fluid loss quantitation test in women with urinary incontinence: a test-retest analysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A modified perineal pad-weighing method for objective quantitation of fluid loss is presented. The bladder was filled by retrograde flow, a sequence of provocative maneuvers was performed under direct supervision, and fluid loss was determined by pad weights. An analysis of immediate test-retest correlation and variability was done in patients with either sphincteric incompetence alone (N = 46) or detrusor instability with or without concomitant sphincteric incompetence (N = 21). Test-retest correlations were high in both groups, suggesting that the method could be applied as an index of severity of urinary incontinence in women. Test-retest within-patient variability was considerable, and limits its usefulness in the analysis of treatment outcome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Factors influencing women's decision to undergo mammography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite the consensus that mammography is a valuable screening tool for the detection of early breast cancer, it is underused by physicians, and most women remain unconvinced of its efficacy. We studied consecutively 735 women who underwent mammography at two rural midwestern hospitals to determine the factors that influence the decision to undergo mammography. Those who underwent mammography had significantly more education and higher household incomes than the general population. The decision to have mammography was influenced by many factors, the most important of which were encouragement by the doctor, influence of the media, and the cost of the mammogram. Women of higher socioeconomic status were most likely to be influenced by the media, particularly printed material, but were much less likely than women of lower socioeconomic status to report physician influence as an important factor. These data have implications for the methods physicians use in recommending mammography to individual patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metabolic and hormonal effects of 25-mg and 50-mg 17 beta-estradiol implants in surgically menopausal women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A prospective study involving 12 surgically menopausal women was undertaken to determine whether 17 beta-estradiol pellets could maintain bone mineral content without inducing adverse cardiovascular side effects. Surgically menopausal women were randomly selected to have either 25-mg or 50-mg pellets implanted subcutaneously. The bone mineral content of the midshaft of the nondominant radius in the combined group--measured by single photon absorptiometry--increased by 1.8% over the two-year period of observation (P less than .03); the distal bone mineral content of the radius was maintained at 0.8% per annum. No adverse effects were noted in the coagulation profiles or in the coagulation inhibition and fibrinolysis assays of both groups. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were unaltered, but serum cholesterol values decreased during the six-month period of observation by 14 mg/dL (P less than .05) and 11 mg/dL in the 25- and 50-mg groups, respectively. Carbohydrate and insulin metabolism was unaffected, as was the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There were no significant intergroup differences in any of the parameters measured. The serum estradiol/estrone ratios of 1.45 and 1.59 reflected a physiologic estrogen milieu at the 25- and 50-mg dosages. Subcutaneous 17 beta-estradiol pellets can effectively maintain the bone mineral content of surgically menopausal women without inducing adverse cardiovascular side effects.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A prospective double-blind study was performed to evaluate the effect of prophylactic antibiotic treatment before induced abortion. Eight hundred consecutive women admitted for first-trimester abortion, without signs of genital infection or antibiotic use in the last three weeks, were included in the study. Doxycycline 400 mg or placebo was given as a single oral dose ten to 12 hours before vacuum aspiration. Ninety-one women (11.8%) returned to the hospital with suspected complications. Thirty-two of these women were diagnosed as having pelvic inflammatory disease, eight of whom (2.1%) had received doxycycline before the abortion and 24 of whom (6.2%) had received placebo, a statistically significant difference (P less than .01). A history of pelvic inflammatory disease increased the risk of developing it again after an abortion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intraperitoneal cis-platinum as salvage therapy for refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Eighteen patients with residual epithelial ovarian cancer at second-look laparotomy were treated with a combined total of 210 cycles of intraperitoneal cis-platinum. Sixteen patients had previously received cis-platinum containing combination chemotherapy systemically. Seven patients had microscopic residual disease at the start of intraperitoneal therapy, eight had macroscopic disease of 5 mm in diameter or less, and three had disease of 6-10 mm in diameter. The drug was administered weekly in 2 L of Ringer's lactate solution via an indwelling Tenckhoff catheter, and the dose ranged from 30-270 mg per cycle (median 120 mg). The dwell time was 20 minutes. After 12 cycles, response was assessed by open laparoscopy (six patients), laparotomy (eight patients), or peritoneal cytology (three patients). One patient developed distant metastases. Local and systemic toxicity was mild. Delays of therapy were necessary for eight of the 210 cycles because of hematologic toxicity. Of the 15 patients available for pathologic evaluation, four (26.6%) had a complete response and two (13.3%) had a partial response. Results of this pilot study suggest a possible role for intraperitoneal cis-platinum in the management of carefully selected patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment of metastatic stromal tumors of the ovary with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- From September 1981 until June 1986, eight patients with metastatic ovarian stromal tumors were entered into a prospective phase II study to determine the efficacy of a chemotherapy regimen combining cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Patients received cisplatin 40-50 mg/m2 intravenously (IV), doxorubicin 40-50 mg/m2 IV, and cyclophosphamide 400-500 mg/m2 IV, all on day 1 every 28 days. The median age was 43 years (range 24-65 years). Two patients had stage II disease, one had stage III, and five had recurrent disease (original stage: four stage I and one stage III). The median number of chemotherapy cycles was six (range four to 14). Three patients (38%) had a complete response to therapy (two confirmed by second-look laparotomy), and two patients (25%) achieved a partial response (one verified by second-look laparotomy). The overall response rate was 63%. Toxicity was minimal. Four patients are disease-free at 13+ to 48+ months, one patient is alive with disease at six+ months, and three patients are dead of tumor at four, 17, and 36 months from the start of chemotherapy. These results indicate that the combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide has modest activity in the treatment of metastatic ovarian stromal tumor.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred twelve patients with early (FIGO stage I and II) ovarian carcinoma had a second-look laparotomy performed after comprehensive surgical staging and randomization into clinical protocols. Of the 95 patients who were asymptomatic before second-look laparotomy, only 5% had positive findings. In contrast, 53% of the 17 patients with findings that suggested recurrence or bowel obstruction had disease at second-look laparotomy. Overall, only 13% of the entire group of 112 patients had recurrent disease at second-look laparotomy. Asymptomatic patients with early ovarian carcinoma who have undergone careful initial surgical staging followed by appropriate adjuvant therapy can be spared a routine second-look operation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Histologic prognosticators in stage I squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sixty-four cases of stage I vulvar squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed histologically to define a patient subset at minimum risk for recurrence or nodal metastases. Three patterns of invasion were predefined: carcinoma in situ with early stromal invasion (33%), pushing (8%), and infiltrative (59%). Infiltrative pattern and invasion deeper than 1.5 mm equally predicted nodal metastases (P = .045), although depth measurement in biopsy specimens was subject to sampling error. Confluence and absence of carcinoma in situ each predicted extranodal recurrence (P = .011). Local recurrence appeared more related to inadequate surgical margins than failure to perform radical vulvectomy. Carcinoma in situ with early stromal invasion represents a group at zero risk for nodal metastases. We recommend wide local excision for all stage I lesions. In general, omission of lymphadenectomy should be reserved for cases of carcinoma in situ with early stromal invasion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A simplified method for determining individual growth curve standards.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To simplify the procedure for obtaining individual growth curve standards, we investigated the use of models derived from the slopes of growth curves determined before 26 weeks' menstrual age. In serial examinations of 33 normal fetuses between 15-38 weeks, we obtained measurements of the biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur diaphysis length, head profile area, abdominal profile area, head cube, and abdominal cube. Rossavik models fitted to these data provided estimates of the coefficients c and s, and fitting linear models to the data before 26 weeks gave estimates of growth curve slopes. Slopes were also estimated from two data points at approximately 16 and 25 weeks. Regression analysis demonstrated a strong linear relationship between loge c and loge SLOPE1 (R2 = 87.3-98.4%), and between s and c (R2 = 64.9-90.3%). Using these relationships, growth models were determined from the slope values. Comparisons between observed measurements and those predicted by these models for the period after 26 weeks indicated that the methods of slope calculation were equally accurate in predicting future growth, and that this accuracy was very similar to that obtained with models based on regression analysis. These results demonstrate that individual growth curve standards for at least eight anatomic parameters during the last 14 weeks of pregnancy can be determined from the data obtained in two examinations before 26 weeks' menstrual age.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Collagen bandage lenses were inserted in 24 eyes of white New Zealand rabbits following 8-incision radial keratotomy. Specimens were examined at eight and 24 hours by light and electron microscopy. Treated eyes demonstrated more complete epithelial healing, as evidenced by surface microvilli and differentiation into multi-layers. In the treated eyes there was reduced stromal edema at the wound site, and reactive keratocytes were limited to the wound margins. Collagen bandage lenses therefore may be useful in the treatment of a variety of ocular surface problems.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Removal of lens epithelial cells by ultrasound in endocapsular cataract surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A new method was developed to remove lens epithelial cells during endocapsular cataract surgery using a device with a tip that resembles the irrigating-aspirating tip for cortex removal by extracapsular cataract extraction. The tip has an opening on the side and end, both 0.20 mm in diameter, for aspiration. The opening at the end serves to remove the cells at the equator. The top of the tip is sandblasted to provide an abrasive surface. This tip is connected to a phacoemulsifier handle. After nucleus delivery and cortex removal, the tip is inserted beneath the inner surface of the anterior capsule. The cells are detached by the abrasive tip, which vibrates by ultrasound, and then aspirated. Histologic examination revealed that the cells can be removed completely, and that this method is more effective than vacuum cleaning.</ABSTRACT>

Our study group consisted of 20 patients who developed radiation-induced ocular ischemia following cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy for a choroidal or ciliary body melanoma. Eleven of the 20 patients were treated by panretinal photocoagulation shortly after the diagnosis of ocular ischemia, but nine patients were left untreated. In this non-randomized study, the rate of development of neovascular glaucoma was significantly lower (p = 0.024) for the 11 photocoagulated patients than for the nine who were left untreated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Unilateral blepharochalasis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We present two unique cases of unilateral blepharochalasis. Blepharochalasis is an idiopathic disorder of young adults manifested by intermittent, recurrent episodes of eyelid edema. After repeated episodes of swelling, the periorbital tissue develops premature aging with thinned, redundant skin and stretching of the eyelid tendons. Blepharochalasis is considered bilateral; unilateral cases are extremely rare. Ptosis surgery in these cases may be unpredictable due to alterations in the levator aponeurosis. Simple reattachment of the apparent edge of the disinserted levator aponeurosis may cause significant overcorrection and variations in postoperative eyelid heights. Our two unilateral cases demonstrated proptosis on the affected side, and prominent vessels in the levator aponeurosis and suborbicularis muscle planes, plus vascular changes in orbital fat in one case. Blepharochalasis therefore may be an orbital rather than a periorbital disease, as suggested previously. Proptosis is probably overlooked in the usual bilateral cases. When all other causes of unilateral swelling have been ruled out and the findings are consistent with blepharochalasis, this diagnosis should be considered.</ABSTRACT>

- A 76-year-old male had orbital extension and regional lymph node involvement from an oncocytic carcinoma thought to have arisen in the plica semilunaris of the left eye. Declining early orbital exenteration and radical neck dissection, the patient received radiation therapy. Although initial palliation was achieved, the lesion recurred 1 year later, with massive orbital involvement. Despite exenteration and chemotherapy, the patient expired within 6 months. Oncocytomas arise from transformed epithelial cells, generally in the medial canthal region. Oncocytic carcinoma of the ocular adnexa is extremely rare and no such lesion of the plica semilunaris has been reported.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A 59-year-old woman had a sectorial pigmented iris tumor in her right eye and was found to have secondary glaucoma unresponsive to medical therapy. Gonioscopy revealed a satellite tumor in the inferior chamber angle, which we suspected to be a ciliary body melanoma. Subsequently, both lesions were removed completely by superior total and inferior partial iridocyclectomy. Histologic examination disclosed a spindle cell nevus with surface plaque associated with a borderline epithelioid cell nevus. This case is an example of unexpected clinical findings that may be encountered in any iris melanocytic lesion, benign or malignant, and the consequent problems of diagnosis and management.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A case of toxic epidermal necrolysis had been observed in a 4-year-old child. This patient has been reexamined by us 21 years later. At that time a biopsy of conjunctival material and a histopathologic and ultrastructural study were done. The long-term ocular complications of the disease caused severe visual impairment with a remarkable sicca syndrome due to extensive scarring and keratinization, as confirmed also by light- and electron-microscopic features. These findings, concerning a particularly long follow-up, suggest that the ocular sequelae of this disease require continuous ophthalmological supervision many years after the acute stage of the disease.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A 57-year-old woman developed a ciliary body mass which compressed the anterior side of the lens with focal cataract causing the iris to protrude into the anterior chamber. The lesion was removed by a large iridocyclectomy. The mass was classified as an epithelioma of the ciliary body, which was consistent with a benign epithelioma, i.e. an adenoma of the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium. Light and electron microscopic examinations revealed that the tumor cells had characteristics of both the ciliary and iris epithelium, which originated from the neuroectoderm, including abundant cytoplasmic filaments, and pheomelanosomes, and that the gland-like lumen was the pseudoacinous lumen, i.e. invaginated stroma containing the vitreous.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The authors studied the incidence, type and systemic relationship of the retinal findings observed by ophthalmoscopy in Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) in a consecutive series of 34 cases. It is found that retinal vasculitis either arterial and/or, more frequently, venous is present in 55.9% of the cases. Branch vein retinal thrombosis appeared as complication of such small vessel vasculitis in 1 case. Although frequent, the retinal findings were asymptomatic in all cases but the retinal vein thrombosis one, and were not significatively related to or were predicted by other systemic parameters of severity of the disease. Because of its frequency, retinal vasculitis might be considered as an important clinical sign of MSF in endemic areas.</ABSTRACT>

One case showed elevated titer to herpes simplex virus type 1 in the convalescent phase, while the other to varicella-zoster virus, suggesting that these 2 viruses could cause this disease. Electron microscopy showed persistent lymphocytes and macrophages throughout the course, while plasma cells appeared at the height of the inflammation corresponding to the locally elevated antibody titers.

For participants whose age at diagnosis was less than 30 years and who were taking insulin (996 persons) the prevalence rate of panretinal photocoagulation (13.9%) was higher than that of focal photocoagulation (3.6%). For those whose age at diagnosis was 30 years or older (1370 persons), the prevalence rate for panretinal photocoagulation (3.6%) was slightly higher than that of focal photocoagulation (3.0%). Seventy-two percent of eyes of younger onset and 45% of eyes of older onset persons that had received panretinal photocoagulation treatment were found to have incomplete regression of retinal new vessels, and in approximately half of these eyes severe proliferative retinopathy (Diabetic Retinopathy Study High Risk Characteristics [DRS-HRC]) was present. Among eyes with DRS-HRC, 55% were found to be untreated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Macular edema in Diabetic Retinopathy Study patients. Diabetic Retinopathy Study Report Number 12.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Results from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) demonstrate that scatter photocoagulation is associated with some loss of visual acuity soon after treatment. This visual loss is especially prominent in eyes with preexisting macular edema. It is also associated with the intensity of treatment. Reducing macular edema by focal photocoagulation before initiating scatter treatment and dividing scatter treatment into multiple sessions with less intense burns may decrease the risk of the visual loss associated with photocoagulation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment techniques and clinical guidelines for photocoagulation of diabetic macular edema. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Report Number 2. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) has recently shown that argon laser photocoagulation treatment is beneficial in reducing the risk of visual loss from clinically significant diabetic macular edema. The ETDRS treatment consisted of a combination of focal treatment to individual-leaking microaneurysms and grid treatment to areas of diffuse leakage and capillary nonperfusion. These techniques are described in detail, and the concepts of "clinically significant macular edema" and "treatable lesions" are defined. Guidelines for the application of ETDRS findings to clinical practice are discussed..I 56613  .U  88014961  .S  Ophthalmology 8801; 94(7):775-9  .M  Diabetic Retinopathy/*CO; Human; Medical Illustration; Neovascularization/ET/SU; Retinal Detachment/ET/*SU; Retinal Hemorrhage/ET/SU; Retinal Vessels; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vitrectomy/*MT; Vitreous Hemorrhage/ET/*SU.  .T  Changing indications and techniques for vitrectomy in management of complications of diabetic retinopathy.  .P  JOURNAL ARTICLE.  .W  During the past two decades, the number of diabetic patients requiring vitrectomy for nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage has decreased four-fold, whereas there has been a substantial increase in diabetic patients with traction and combined traction/rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) requiring surgery. Additional contemporary surgical indications are progressive fulminant neovascular proliferation, massive preretinal hemorrhage, massive fibrin response, and progressive retrolental fibrovascular proliferation. Surgical techniques for management of tractional detachments have evolved from circumscription of tractional epicenters to en bloc removal of all proliferative tissue.  </ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in culture were found to release a substance (or substances) that causes the regression of new blood vessels on the chick embryonic yolk sac and inhibits proliferation of fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells and human retinal microvessel endothelial cells in vitro. Neither astrocytes nor fibroblasts under identical test conditions released detectable inhibitors of neovascularization or endothelial cell growth. Subconfluent and superconfluent cultures of human RPE cells released higher levels of inhibitor than confluent cultures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pseudophakic and aphakic retinal detachment mimicking cystoid macular edema.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seventeen eyes of patients who were being followed by their ophthalmologists for aphakic (8 eyes) or pseudophakic (9 eyes) cystoid macular edema (CME) were examined on referral. All eyes showed retinal detachment (RD), and eight eyes had CME with RD. Most RDs were inferior and shallow. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) was noted in 15 eyes (88.2%). There was history of vitreous loss during the last intraocular surgery in 88.2% eyes. Visual acuity ranged from 20/40 to hand movements. Fundus view was hazy in most eyes, and indirect ophthalmoscopy was most useful in detecting RD. Retinal reattachment with scleral buckling and/or vitrectomy was achieved in 16 eyes (94.1%). Postoperative visual recovery was jeopardized due to longstanding macular detachment of greater than 1 month in 11 eyes (64.7%). Eight eyes (47%) achieved 20/50 vision whereas 25% did not improve to better than 20/400. Factors leading to failure in making the correct diagnosis and their prevention are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prealbumin. A major constituent of vitreous amyloid.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Vitreous amyloid may be the presenting clinical manifestation of types 1 and 2 familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy or complicate the course of these syndromes. Recent studies have shown that the major subunit protein composing amyloid fibrils in these conditions is a variant or abnormal prealbumin molecule and that affected individuals have low levels of this protein in their blood. The authors studied material obtained at vitrectomy from two cases of vitreous amyloid. One of these was nonfamilial and the other familial. Two-dimensional gels of solubilized protein from pelleted and washed vitreous amyloid in both cases were found to consist of material with the molecular weight and isofocusing coordinates of prealbumin monomer. Reactivity of fibrils with a monospecific antiserum to prealbumin was confirmed by colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy. Non-familial as well as familial vitreous amyloid may in fact be systemic forms of amyloidosis due to deposition of prealbumin which can be characterized by biochemical or immunohistologic studies of material obtained at vitrectomy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Visual acuity loss in patients with Stargardt's macular dystrophy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ninety-five patients with Stargardt's macular dystrophy were appraised for visual loss with age by both life-table analyses and cross-sectional procedures. The probability of maintaining a visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye was 52% by age 19, 32% by age 29, and 22% by age 39. In the population studied, once a patient's visual acuity dropped below 20/40, it tended to decrease rapidly and stabilize at 20/200. Fluorescein angiograms obtained on 64 of the 95 patients showed a "dark choroid" in 55 (85.9%). This finding, therefore was present in the majority of the patients, although its absence does not rule out Stargardt's macular dystrophy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prevalence and mechanisms of secondary intraocular pressure elevation in eyes with intraocular tumors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A survey of 2704 eyes with intraocular tumors in patients who were evaluated on the Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital showed that 126 of the tumor-containing eyes (5%) had tumor-induced elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) at the time of diagnosis of the tumor. Of the 2111 eyes with uveal melanomas, secondary IOP elevation was present in 55 (3%). Secondary IOP elevation was present in 7% of eyes with iris melanoma, 17% with ciliary body melanoma, and 2% with choroidal melanoma. The most common mechanism of elevated IOP was tumor invasion of the angle in the case of iris melanomas, pigment dispersion and tumor invasion of the angle in the case of ciliary body melanomas, and iris neovascularization in the case of choroidal melanomas. Of the 256 eyes with uveal metastases, secondary IOP elevation was found in 12 eyes (5%). Secondary IOP elevation was present in 64% of eyes with iris metastases, 67% with ciliary body metastases, and 1% with choroidal metastases. The most common mechanism of elevated IOP was tumor invasion of the angle in the case of iris and ciliary body metastases, and angle closure in the case of choroidal metastases. There were 303 eyes with retinoblastoma, 17% of which had elevated IOP which was secondary to iris neovascularization in 70% of cases and to an angle closure without neovascularization in 27%. Several other intraocular tumors including lymphoma, leukemia, medulloepithelioma, melanocytoma, and adenoma of the iris pigment epithelium were occasionally associated with secondary elevated IOP.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Improving the therapeutic index of topical phenylephrine by reducing drop volume.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study examined the effect of reducing eyedrop volume on the efficacy and systemic absorption of a given quantity of phenylephrine hydrochloride. Aqueous phenylephrine hydrochloride (2.5%) given in the commercially available drop volume of 32 microliters was compared with 10% aqueous phenylephrine given in an 8-microliters volume. Both preparations contained the same total amount of phenylephrine per drop. Ten subjects had both eyes dilated with each of the phenylephrine solutions according to a randomized, double-crossover sequence. The mean final pupillary diameter was nearly 1.0 mm larger for the 8-microliters drop (P = 0.0033). Nine of ten subjects achieved a larger pupillary diameter with the 8-microliters drop. Systemic absorption, as measured by plasma phenylephrine level, was similar for the two drop volumes. Thus, the 8-microliters drop achieved a significantly larger pupillary dilation without an increase in systemic absorption. Phenylephrine may have the most favorable risk-benefit ratio when administered as a high concentration in a small volume.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Three-year efficacy of argon laser trabeculoplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors report on the effect of argon laser trabeculoplasty on intraocular pressure (IOP) over a 3-year period with a mean follow-up period of 1.8 years in patients with uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma who had not undergone prior surgery. An analysis of the effect of laser trabeculoplasty using the criteria for success of an IOP of 22 mmHg or less with no further laser trabeculoplasty or glaucoma surgery, showed a cumulative success of 79% (112 eyes) at 1 year, 69% (85 eyes) at 2 years, and 59% (58 eyes) at 3 years. Similar results are presented for 22 eyes from patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. The authors conclude that although the initial success rate of laser trabeculoplasty is high, it diminishes progressively over time.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long-term follow-up of lens changes with Scheimpflug photography in diabetics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study was designed to document and quantify changes in lens clarity over 24 months in a group of diabetic patients. One hundred thirty-four type I and type II diabetics of 3 months' to 45 years' duration with an average age of 53.5 +/- 7 years volunteered to participate in this prospective study. Patients were evaluated upon entry and at 6-month intervals. Scheimpflug lens photographs (Topcon SL45) were taken at each visit. All photographs were evaluated by densitometry which allowed quantification of the light scattering in the various lens layers. A significant and progressive (4-7% every 6 months) increase in light scattering was observed in the lens anterior superficial lens cortex over 24 months. The rate of change in lens clarity was similar in all patients regardless of the clinically observable lens change type (nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, or mixed). Patients who were younger at enrollment, having diabetes of shorter duration and higher glycosylated hemoglobin values (a measure of long-term glucose control), were identified to be at greater risk of having increased densitometry values in the anterior superficial lens cortex. Only a few patients had significant changes in visual acuity during 24 months, and the correlation of superficial cortical lens clarity changes to clinical cataract formation and visual impairment remains to be established.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Eosinophilic granuloma of the orbit with spontaneous healing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 13-year-old boy presented with a 2-month history of swelling of the right upper eyelid and displacement of the right eye. Computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor in the right orbit and a large osteolytic defect of the orbital frontal bone. At surgery a yellowish-tan mass was found replacing the orbital roof and abutting the dura. Incisional biopsy established the diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma. In the absence of further therapy, the mass resolved, and the bony defect completely reossified within 14 months. During more than 2 years of follow-up, there has been no evidence of local recurrence or systemic disease. This case demonstrates that eosinophilic granuloma may resolve spontaneously with healing of bony defects, thus eliminating the need for adjunctive resection or radiation therapy in selected patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. VII. Incidence of bilaterality and various influencing factors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A prospective study was conducted in 438 patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). There were 388 patients with nonarteritic AION and 50 with arteritic AION. The risk of bilaterality in patients with arteritic AION was found to be 1.9 times the risk in patients with nonarteritic AION (P = 0.0118). The cumulative incidence curve, considering the time taken to develop bilateral AION for nonarteritic cases was significantly (P = 0.0103) different from that for arteritic cases. The estimated 25th-percentile time to development of bilateral AION was much shorter in patients with arteritic AION (0.4 month) than in those with nonarteritic AION (32.4 months). In arteritic AION, unilateral as well as bilateral AION had almost invariably developed before systemic steroid therapy was started and not after, indicating that this therapy is effective in preventing the development of AION in giant cell arteritis. In nonarteritic AION, the risk of bilaterality was significantly greater in men (P = 0.0113) and in young (less than 45 years old) patients with diabetes (P = 0.0245), with no significant difference attributable to the other age groups or other associated systemic diseases. In this study, it was found that young diabetic men have a risk of AION developing in the second eye that is 1.56 times the risk in young diabetic women, 2.56 times the risk in women who either are nondiabetic or are not young, and 1.64 times the risk in both older men and nondiabetic men.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Deficits in visual function after resolution of optic neuritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A study was done to systematically characterize visual function in eyes with recovered optic neuritis. Thirty-five eyes from 27 patients, all of whom had recovered at least 20/30 Snellen acuity after resolution of the neuritis, were included. Minimum recovery period was 6 months. Abnormalities were found in color vision (57%), contrast sensitivity (72%), perimetry (26%), stereoacuity (80%), light brightness (89%), pupillary reaction (89%), and optic disc appearance (77%). Eighty-five percent of patients complained of at least some subjective disturbance in vision. Subjective visual complaints correlated better with deficits in contrast sensitivity than they did with the other measures. The results of the study indicate that deficits in visual function are common after resolution of optic neuritis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Two-flash photorefraction in screening of amblyogenic refractive errors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A selection of amblyopic (n = 14) and nonamblyopic (n = 18) children with different ametropias, anisometropias, and astigmatisms was photorefracted without cycloplegia by two-flash photorefraction (T-FP) in which refractions in both horizontal and vertical meridians of both eyes are measured simultaneously. The results were compared to conventional cycloplegic retinoscopy in a blind study. Significant amblyogenic conditions, such as hyperopic anisometropias of more than 1.0 diopter (D), high ametropias, or astigmatism and strabismus cases of 2 degrees to 3 degrees or more are detectable. The technique provides a simple and useful tool for mass screening of infants. The sensitivity of the method for detecting amblyopia seems to be at least as high as in visual checking. Media opacities are recordable, and a permanent document is obtained.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The technique and results of simultaneous superior oblique tenotomy and 14-mm inferior oblique recession for true Brown's syndrome are presented for 16 eyes of 13 patients. A good or excellent result was achieved in 15 of 16 eyes (94%). Reoperation for overcorrection was not necessary; however, repeat tenotomy was required in two cases. Inferior oblique underaction was present in 12 of 16 eyes (75%) in the early postoperative period; however, elevation in adduction improved over time. At most recent examination, 92% of eyes demonstrated greater than 25 degrees elevation in adduction. Underaction of the superior oblique occurred in 3 of 16 eyes (19%). A simultaneous superior oblique tenotomy and inferior oblique recession is recommended in all patients selected to undergo surgery for true Brown's syndrome to prevent reoperation for iatrogenic superior oblique palsy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Congenital unilateral adduction deficit with simultaneous abduction. A variant of Duane's retraction syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Congenital adduction deficit not associated with other signs of oculomotor nerve weakness occurs infrequently. Type 2 Duane's retraction syndrome accounts for some of these cases. The authors identified three children with unilateral adduction deficits and simultaneous abduction of the eyes on attempted lateral gaze into the field of action of the apparently paretic medial rectus muscle. This is the first report of a series of patients with this condition previously termed simultaneous or synergistic divergence. All patients had a large exotropia, and two had a horizontal face turn away from the involved eye. A large (14 mm) lateral rectus muscle recession done on one of these children reduced the face turn but did not eliminate the simultaneous abduction. Clinical, intraoperative, and electromyographic data suggest that this condition is an unusual variant of type 2 Duane's syndrome.</ABSTRACT>

Macroscopically visible white opacities in the cortical vitreous of the posterior fundus were shown immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally to be macrophages containing bileaflet inclusions, a finding previously unreported. Additional findings included extensive loss of the retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers, optic nerve degeneration, and bileaflet inclusions in retinal pigment epithelial cells and macrophages of the retina and optic nerve.

<TITLE>- Contact lenses in the treatment of patients with overcorrected radial keratotomy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-two eyes of 28 patients who underwent radial keratotomy had a hyperopic overcorrection after the surgical procedure. Anisometropia, with associated aniseikonia and depth perception problems were present in many of these patients. The patients were subsequently fit with contact lenses. Conventional methods of fitting contact lenses in these patients were unsuccessful. A trial lens technique is used with the initial lens having a base curve equal to the preoperative keratometry measurements and the power equal to the preoperative spherical equivalent. Superficial neovascularization developed within the radial incisions in 33% of the eyes fitted with soft contact lenses. Gas permeable contact lenses offered patients the best-corrected visual acuity as well as minimal complications. In addition, the anisometropia was minimized, and fluctuating vision was eliminated in cases in which it was a problem.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Synthetic keratophakia for the correction of aphakia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although the majority of aphakic patients will have intraocular lens implants (IOLs), there are several groups of patients for whom IOLs are not indicated. Synthetic keratophakia for the correction of aphakia has several inherent advantages over alternative forms of refractive surgery which use lathed corneal tissue. For example, the ability to produce a synthetic lens to precise specifications before surgery is a dramatic advantage over the use of lathed tissue lenses whose refractive properties cannot be determined until weeks or months after the lens is in place on the recipient cornea. Synthetic materials appear to behave in a predictable manner and are biocompatible. Both polysulfones and hydrogel materials can be used to correct aphakia in clinical situations where other modalities are less appropriate.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ligneous conjunctivitis. A clinicopathologic study of 17 cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seventeen cases of ligneous conjunctivitis were studied. Most of the patients were children; however, two elderly individuals were involved (range, birth to 85 years). The most common site was the tarsal conjunctiva, where firm sessile or pedunculated membranous lesions were seen. However, corneal involvement, as well as similar and recurrent lesions, were also present in the larynx, vocal cords, trachea, nose, vagina, cervix, and gingiva. Many recurrences (up to 10 times) rapidly followed simple surgical excision in all patients. Histopathologically, the lesions were characterized by subepithelial, eosinophilic, amorphous material admixed with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. The finding of amorphous material containing fibrin, immunoglobulins, and albumin suggested leakage from hyperpermeable blood vessels. Electron microscopic studies of the lesions disclosed few abnormal blood vessels with wide gaps between endothelial cells that were surrounded by a thick multilaminar basement membrane. The duration of the disease ranged from 4 months to 44 years. After several recurrences, spontaneous resolution occurred in six patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Large congenital melanocytic nevus. Light and electron microscopic findings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The family of a 10-month-old black girl with a large periocular congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) was given markedly differing advice from experienced physicians regarding how the lesion should be managed. The nevus was eventually removed surgically because of concern about the risk of malignant transformation and because of its cosmetic appearance. Histologically, the lesion was a dermal nevus, but extended deeply into subcutaneous tissue and had neuroid features. The ultrastructural characteristics of melanocytes varied according to the depth at which they resided, but cells did not differ basically from melanocytes found in smaller acquired nevi. Given the limited understanding of the biologic basis for malignant transformation, large size remains the most important risk factor in CMN.</ABSTRACT>

This case is unusual for several reasons. First, eyelid metastases are rare; they are much more uncommon than metastases to the uvea or orbit. Second, metastatic tumors to the eyelid are usually manifestations of widespread disease and seldom occur as a solitary focus of dissemination. Third, the clinical presentation of our patient's lesion as an eyelid cyst is uncommon for a metastasis to the eyelid. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, all previously reported tumors metastatic to the eyelid have been carcinomas; this is the first report of a metastatic soft-tissue tumor to the eyelid.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effectiveness of botulinum toxin therapy for essential blepharospasm.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effectiveness of Botulinum toxin (Oculinum) therapy in 76 patients with the diagnosis of essential blepharospasm was analyzed. Botulinum offers relief to almost all patients suffering from essential blepharospasm, however, this relief is usually temporary. The response time for repeated treatments tended to be longer than the first treatment. Patients with mild blepharospasm responded significantly longer to Botulinum injection, than those with severe spasms. The response to Botulinum was not significantly different in patients with Meige syndrome than in patients with only essential blepharospasm. Patients previously treated surgically for essential blepharospasm did not respond differently than those patients with no previous surgical therapy. The authors believe that Botulinum toxin injection is an effective, although temporary, mode of therapy for the signs and symptoms of this focal dystonia. The authors recognize that there may be psychologic factors affecting the response.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred patients with involuntary eyelid and facial spasms resulting from essential blepharospasm, Meige syndrome, and hemifacial spasm continued to respond to repeated injections of botulinum toxin at expected time intervals during a 30-month period. This series of more than 372 injections done by one of us (JAM) supports the finding of earlier, smaller series that tolerance to the toxin does not develop. The drug had a greater duration of effect in patients with hemifacial spasm than in patients with blepharospasm; the duration of effect was 17.25 weeks in the former group and 12.6 weeks in the latter. Eighteen percent of patients required a higher than standard dose for a therapeutic response. Fourteen of 15 patients with lower facial spasms and one patient with torticollis had significant relief. Dry eye may be managed by titrating the lower lid dose.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Genotypic monoclonality in immunophenotypically polyclonal orbital lymphoid tumors. A model of tumor progression in the lymphoid system. The 1986 Wendell Hughes lecture.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Molecular genetic (genotypic) analysis elucidates gene rearrangements within lymphocytes that are responsible for either immunoglobulin production in B-lymphocytes or the expression of cell-surface antigen recognition receptors in T-lymphocytes. Molecular genetic analysis is far more sensitive than immunophenotypic methods for the detection of small clones of lymphocytes because as few as 2 to 5% of cells in an infiltrate can be discovered to possess the same rearranged DNA sequences with genetic probes. In truly polyclonal proliferations, each lymphocyte reorganizes its immunoglobulin or T-antigen receptor genes in a unique manner, resulting in an almost infinite number of combinations of genetic rearrangement and the absence of any new hybridizing bands upon Southern blotting. In monoclonal proliferations, a new, homogeneous, nongermline band is identified on Southern blotting because a sufficiently large number of lymphocytes exhibit an identical genetic rearrangement. In a group of five orbital lymphoid tumors that appeared to be benign reactive hyperplasias by light microscopy and that were polyclonal by immunophenotypic methods, three were found by molecular genetic analysis to harbor small clones of B-lymphocytes with new rearrangement bands on Southern blotting. No clonal abnormalities of T-lymphocytes were found in these five lesions, despite the fact that they were the preponderant cells in the tumors. These observations suggest that "reactive lymphoid hyperplasia" of the orbit may be an unstable lesion, owing to a T-cell immunoregulatory imbalance, with the potential for developing clonal expansions of B-lymphocytes that nonetheless usually remain localized to the orbit.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Orbital manifestations of plasmacytic lymphoproliferations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Orbital involvement by plasmacytic lymphoproliferative disorders is rare. Presented are four cases, with different clinical onsets and courses, demonstrating the diversity of expression of lymphoproliferative plasma cell lesions of the orbit. The first patient presented with a slowly developing palpable mass in the upper and anterior orbit. This localized lesion proved to be a reactive plasma cell proliferation. The second case had a 3-month history of proptosis, diplopia, and droopy eyelid and a pulsatile temporal mass with bone destruction. Results of biopsy and systemic investigations showed a solitary plasmacytoma of bone. In the third case, a patient with a known multiple myeloma for 2 years presented with a progressive osteolytic mass which proved on biopsy to be a plasmacytoma. At the time, she also had other active bone lesions. The fourth case presented as a possible orbital cellulitis in a man with known multiple myeloma for 2 years. He proved to have disseminated myeloma, the orbital infiltrate being secondary to sinus involvement. The differential diagnosis for each case can be quite involved. Each case required a biopsy for an accurate diagnosis in addition to a complete clinical, radiographic, and laboratory workup. The pathologic features of each tumor can be misleading. These will be discussed as well as the use of ancillary diagnostic methods such as electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to further characterize each lesion. The clinical course and treatment modalities will be discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Exstrophy, epispadias, and cloacal and urogenital sinus abnormalities.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The congenital defects in the pelvis and perineal area, which are derived from defective development of the cloacal membrane, the urorectal septum, the mesonephric and paramesonephric (mullerian) ducts and the urogenital sinus, have been described. These may be life threatening, are often complex, and are certainly devastating to the parents. With knowledge of their embryologic origin, of their anatomy in detail, and the effect on function and drainage, treatment can be planned so that a good quality of life usually can be expected. Improved reconstructive programs and techniques can usually achieve near-normal appearance and function, with the expectation of good social adjustment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Testicular undescent and torsion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The higher the testis resides above the scrotum, the more dysgenetic the morphology is likely to be. High testes are rarely responsive to HCG and should be treated by orchiopexy by the age of 2 to 3 years. The undescended testis does not mature normally after the age of 2 years and may produce adverse effects on the contralateral descended testis, possibly by an autoimmune mechanism. A course of HCG for boys with low-lying undescended testes, both unilateral and bilateral, may produce descent in as many as 15 per cent of patients and may make the technical aspects of orchiopexy easier in those who do not respond. Unilateral cryptorchid testes that are dysplastic or located high should generally be removed before adolescence.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pediatric urinary diversion and undiversion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Many things have changed in our management of the urinary tract of children and young adults. Important contributions from many sources have resulted in the refinement of therapy and the progression from diversion to undiversion and reconstruction. Primary urinary diversion is now uncommon. Patients with exstrophy, for example, are treated with primary bladder closure as newborns, and newborns with valves often are treated with primary valve ablation. Children with neurogenic bladder dysfunction resulting from myelodysplasia are rarely diverted, but are started at an early age with ICC. It is hoped that in future the contents of this article on diversion techniques and undiversion will be of historical interest, however. Note: The editors also have found the use of the Mitrofanoff procedure, utilizing a nonrefluxing tunnel and a catheterizable stoma made out of the ureter or appendix, to be a very valuable addition to the reconstructive surgeon's armamentarium. We also feel that use of detubularized bowel for either bladder augmentation or replacement provides more efficient storage capability. Occasional reports of extremely significant diarrhea after removal of the ileocecal segment from the intestinal tract have been reported in children with myelodysplasia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Varicella in children with cancer: impact of antiviral therapy and prophylaxis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To estimate the impact of antiviral therapy and prophylaxis on the natural course of the infection, 288 cases of varicella in children with cancer were reviewed. Among 127 patients with untreated infections, the overall mortality rate was 7%. Varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis developed in 28% of the untreated patients and was associated with a 25% mortality rate. Pneumonitis was much more likely to develop in patients with acute leukemia than in those with other malignancies (32% v 19%). Similarly, deaths due to pneumonitis were restricted to patients with acute leukemia. Lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 500/microL) was significantly associated with varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis and a higher fatality rate among patients with this complication. Both acyclovir and adenine arabinoside, administered to 18 and 28 patients, respectively, stopped the progression of skin lesions; however, pneumonitis developed in none of the acyclovir recipients after two days of treatment, compared with 29% of the adenine arabinoside recipients (P = .03). Passive immunization in 45 children who subsequently had varicella was associated with an 11% incidence of varicella-zoster virus pneumonitis. Despite passive immunization of approximately 150 children, the attack rate of varicella at our institution remains unchanged. Results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of antiviral therapy and passive immunization in patients with childhood cancer and varicella, but prevention of the infection will require a universal vaccine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Candidate rotavirus vaccine (rhesus rotavirus strain) in children: an evaluation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifty children, 3 months to 12 years of age, were given an experimental, orally administered, live attenuated rotavirus vaccine. Overall evidence of vaccine effectiveness as judged by vaccine virus shedding or a serologic response was seen in 82% of vaccinees. No clinical illness was seen in the rotavirus vaccinees when compared with 40 concurrently studied control children. No transmission to control children was observed even with close daily contact in a day-care setting. Young infants, generally less than 1 year of age, who had not previously experienced wild-type rotavirus infection shed significantly more vaccine virus. Limitation of virus shedding in those already exposed may be related to a prompt copro-IgA response which was significantly elevated by three days after vaccination. In summary, the development of this rotavirus vaccine, rhesus rotavirus-MMU-18006, is a promising step in the development of immunoprophylaxis against this major enteric pathogen.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sustained release and standard methylphenidate effects on cognitive and social behavior in children with attention deficit disorder.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two studies were conducted to investigate the relative effects of sustained release methylphenidate (Ritalin [SR-20]) and standard methylphenidate (Ritalin, 10 mg, administered twice daily). In the first study, 13 boys with attention deficit disorder participating in a summer treatment program went through a double-blind, within-subject trial of each form of methylphenidate and placebo. Measures of social and cognitive behavior were gathered in classroom and play settings. Although group analyses of the data showed that both drugs were effective and there were few differences between them, standard methylphenidate was superior to SR-20 on several important measures of disruptive behavior. Furthermore, analyses of individual responsivity showed clearly that most boys responded more positively to standard methylphenidate than to SR-20. The second study involved a partially overlapping group of nine boys with attention deficit disorder participating in the same summer treatment program. Also double-blind, within-subject, and placebo controlled, this study tracked the time courses of the two forms of methylphenidate. Both were shown to have similar time courses on the Abbreviated Conners Rating Scale and other measures, but SR-20 had a slower onset than did the standard drug form on a continuous performance task. Effects of SR-20 were still evident eight hours after ingestion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intrauterine growth and gestational duration determinants.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite the general recognition that low birth weight can be caused by many factors, confusion and controversy remain about which factors have independent causal effects, as well as the quantitative importance of those effects. Previous research findings have often been conflicting because of a failure to distinguish intrauterine growth retardation from prematurity, differences in focus (means v rates), inadequate control for confounding variables, and insufficient statistical power. This review of the English and French language medical literature published between 1970 and 1984 is based on a critical assessment and meta-analysis of 895 studies concerning 43 potential determinants of intrauterine growth or gestational duration. Based on methodologic standards established a priori for each candidate determinant, the best studies were used to assess the existence and magnitude of an independent causal effect on birth weight, gestational age, prematurity, and intrauterine growth retardation. Factors with well-established direct causal impacts are identified, and their relative importance is indicated for "typical" developing and developed country settings. Modifiable factors with large effects are targeted for public health intervention in the two settings. Finally, factors of potential quantitative importance, but for which data are either unavailable or inconclusive, are highlighted as priorities for future research.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Taurine improves the absorption of a fat meal in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of taurine supplementation on the absorption of a fat meal was evaluated in patients with cystic fibrosis. In a cross-over design study, five patients with cystic fibrosis (12.1 +/- 2.6 years of age) and three control subjects received either placebo or taurine (30 mg/kg/d) for two 1-week periods, a month apart, followed by a fat meal test. Blood samples were drawn 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 hours after the meal. Four patients with cystic fibrosis and severe steatorrhea despite appropriate enzyme therapy showed a significant (P less than .05) improvement in the absorption of triglycerides, total fatty acids, and linoleic acid while receiving taurine supplements. Three control subjects and one child with cystic fibrosis and mild steatorrhea receiving enzyme therapy did not experience such an effect. The difference in triglyceride absorption, when calculated as the area under the curve, receiving and not receiving taurine was significantly (P less than .05) correlated with the degree of steatorrhea. Furthermore, in contrast to control subjects, the fatty acid composition of chylomicrons in these four study patients showed important discrepancies with that of the fat meal and was corrected, in part, by taurine supplementation. These results suggest that taurine supplementation could be a useful adjunct in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis with ongoing fat malabsorption and essential fatty acid deficiency.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Perilymph fistula: an important cause of deafness and dizziness in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study underscores the importance of considering a perilymph fistula, an abnormal communication between the inner and middle ear, in any child with a progressive sensorineural hearing loss. A concomitant complaint of intermittent dizziness or observed spells of imbalance (56%) is another indication of the disease. Six of 16 patients (37.5%) with proven fistulas were less than 2 years of age at the onset of symptoms. Unless the fistula is identified and repaired by grafting, the ear may become totally deaf. This would be disastrous in the presence of bilateral fistulas, which occur commonly in children (56% of patients had symptoms of bilateral disease). Our experience in recognizing and treating fistulas and thereby saving and restoring hearing is described.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Developmental outcome prediction from acoustic cry analysis in term and preterm infants.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- It has been suggested that the cry may reflect the neurophysiologic integrity of the infant and relate to later developmental outcome. In this study, the cry was recorded at term conceptional age in 18 preterm and 13 term infants using a standardized procedure and analyzed by high-speed computer. At 18 months of age, a significant number of infants were correctly classified as scoring high or low on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development based on the mean and variability in the fundamental frequency, variability in the first formant, and the amplitude of the cry. At 5 years of age, a significant number of infants were correctly classified on the McCarthy General Cognitive Index and on the verbal, perceptual-performance, and quantitative subscales based on the variability of the fundamental frequency, variability of the first formant, and amplitude and duration of the cry. Although preliminary, this study supports the potential use of the cry as a noninvasive measure to detect developmental outcome in the infant at risk.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percutaneous central venous catheter colonization with Malassezia furfur: incidence and clinical significance.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Malassezia furfur colonization of central venous catheters has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic infections with this lipid-dependent yeast. To determine the incidence of catheter colonization in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 25 consecutively removed percutaneous central venous catheters were examined by rinsing the lumen with saline and plating the rinse fluid on Sabouraud dextrose agar overlaid with olive oil. M furfur grew from the lumina of eight catheters (32%). Surveillance skin cultures were performed in the NICU on two occasions to determine the prevalence of skin colonization with M furfur. M furfur was found on the skin of 64% of the infants. In contrast, only 3% (1/33) of healthy, nonhospitalized infants 2 to 8 weeks of age had skin colonized with M furfur. During the 5-month study period, two NICU infants had evidence of systemic infection with M furfur. We conclude that M furfur frequently colonizes both the skin and percutaneous central venous catheters in NICU infants. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between skin colonization and catheter colonization, and the factors contributing to systemic disease with this organism.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Primary hemochromatosis in childhood.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Primary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder rarely recognized in childhood; its long-term consequences include cirrhosis and liver cancer. We report a family with primary hemochromatosis affecting three generations, including a 7-year-old child and a 29-month-old child; these are the youngest children with primary hemochromatosis yet reported. The pathophysiology, genetics, and clinical findings of this disorder are reviewed. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are useful screening tests; definitive diagnosis, however, depends on determination of hepatic iron content. A plan for evaluating and treating affected patients is proposed. Physicians caring for children must learn to recognize this potentially treatable disorder.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Atlantoaxial instability in individuals with Down syndrome: epidemiologic, radiographic, and clinical studies.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Atlantoaxial instability is a relatively frequent finding in individuals with Down syndrome. We examined 404 patients with this chromosome disorder and observed their atlanto-dens intervals and spinal canal widths to be significantly different from children without Down syndrome. Significant differences were also noted between boys and girls with Down syndrome in spinal canal widths but not in atlanto-dens interval measurements. When different neck positions were compared, measurements obtained in flexion were significantly greater than in extension or in neutral position. In addition, more patients had greater than or equal to 5 mm atlanto-dens interval measurements in flexion than in extension or neutral. A total of 59 (14.6%) of 404 patients displayed atlantoaxial instability. Fifty-three (13.1%) patients had asymptomatic atlantoaxial instability, and special precautions will have to be taken with this group of children. Six (1.5%) patients had symptomatic atlantoaxial instability who underwent surgery to prevent further injury to the spinal cord. In our follow-up studies of 95 patients with Down syndrome, we did not find any significant changes during either clinical or radiographic reexaminations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gonorrhea and syphilis in incarcerated urban adolescents: prevalence and physical signs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During a 1-year period from July 1983 to June 1984, 285 adolescent girls and 2,236 adolescent boys, ranging in age from 9 to 18 years (89% were 14 to 16 years of age), were screened for gonorrhea and syphilis on entry into a detention facility in New York City. The prevalence rate for gonorrhea was 3% for boys and 18.3% for girls, and the prevalence rate for syphilis was 0.63% for boys and 2.5% for girls. The rates of gonorrhea without penile or cervical discharge on physical examination were 2.1% for boys and 10.9% for girls. This high prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea and the high frequency of disease without physical signs of illness indicate the desirability of screening high-risk adolescents for these and other sexually transmitted diseases. Our data support the need for programs in detention facilities and, we believe, schools, to encourage use of barrier contraceptives to control gonorrhea, syphilis, Chlamydia, human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and unwanted pregnancy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Temporomandibular joint dysfunction and facial pain in children: an approach to diagnosis and treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A model for the diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and facial pain in children is presented. Emphasis is placed on systematic assessment of physical, psychologic, and behavioral factors when conservative medical therapy is inadequate for symptom relief. The model represents a multidisciplinary approach to patient care which is described through case presentations. The results of research on the incidence of primary psychopathology in 53 children and 322 adults evaluated during a 3-year period for temporomandibular joint dysfunction and facial pain are also presented. It was found that children were more likely to be psychiatrically impaired (25%) than adults (7%). Children had a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including depression, conversion and adjustment disorders, overanxious behavior, and anorexia nervosa. The benefits of a multidisciplinary approach are discussed in terms of the efficacy of this coordinated treatment effort in ameliorating symptoms.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Native American postneonatal mortality.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although dramatic gains have been realized in lowering the incidence of neonatal deaths among native American infants to a level lower than the white race, postneonatal death rates for this population remain twice as high as in the white race. The limited data available reveal that excessive postneonatal deaths among native American infants largely result from preventable accidents and treatable acute medical conditions, such as pneumonia and gastroenteritis. This suggests that native American infants leave the hospital healthy but go to unsafe environments, which decrease their chances of survival past 1 year. In particular, the poorer socioeconomic conditions that native American families experience and the related problems of alcoholism, unemployment, and family disorganization contribute to the high rate of postneonatal mortality. Intervention programs to lower native American postneonatal mortality should focus on promoting prompt recognition of and health seeking for treatable medical conditions and prevention of accidents and other postneonatal health problems. The roots of the problem of native American postneonatal mortality lie in the socioeconomic conditions of many Indian communities and cannot be addressed without recognition of how these factors combine with the health care delivery system to diminish life expectancy for native American infants.</ABSTRACT>

The clinical findings of Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or less, altered consciousness on admission, and focal abnormalities on neurologic examination were each significantly associated with abnormal findings on CT scans (P less than .01). However, 31% of the 51 patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores greater than 12 had abnormal CT scan findings.

<TITLE>- Influence of prior knowledge on automatic and voluntary postural adjustments in healthy and hemiplegic subjects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of prior instruction on automatic postural responses and voluntary postural sways measured about the ankle joint. Ten subjects with right hemiplegia resulting from a cerebrovascular accident (mean age = 56 +/- 14 years) and 5 healthy subjects (mean age = 47 +/- 6 years) stood symmetrically on a movable force platform. During platform-induced sway, the support surface was translated horizontally to induce antero-posterior body sway about the ankle joints. Surface electromyographs were obtained from the tibialis anterior, quadriceps femoris, gastrocnemius, and hamstring muscles bilaterally. Prior knowledge appeared to have no significant influence on healthy subjects' ability to execute postural adjustments more rapidly during AP displacements. Hemiplegic subjects exhibited longer and more variable latencies in the paretic limb than in the nonparetic limb during voluntary AP weight shifts. When hemiplegic subjects had prior knowledge of the platform's movement (time and direction), latencies were significantly shorter in the paretic limb and could be as brief as those seen in the nonparetic limb. The results showed that prior knowledge may be an important treatment consideration for patients with muscle timing disorders.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to compare heart rate responses to water walking versus treadmill walking to determine whether the responses were of sufficient magnitude to elicit cardiorespiratory training effects. The heart rates of 12 healthy, female college students were measured immediately after walking in waist-deep water and on a treadmill at the same distance, durations, and speeds (2.55, 2.77, 3.02, and 3.31 km/hr). A significant increase in heart rate with increased speeds resulted from water walking (p less than .05); from rest to the fastest speed, it was 135% (96 bpm). For treadmill walking, the increase of 19% (13 bpm) was not significant. The heart rates for the water condition were significantly higher (p less than .05) at each speed. These findings indicate that water walking could serve as an effective exercise mode, for example, for cardiorespiratory fitness for individuals who are unable to perform such weight-bearing activities as jogging, fast walking, cycling, and dancing.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of recurrent lateral ankle sprains on subjects' active and passive judgments of joint position. Fourteen subjects with recurrent unilateral ankle sprains contributed data to two groups: 1) In Group 1, the subjects' 14 sprained ankles were tested and 2) in Group 2, the same 14 subjects' contralateral nonsprained ankles were tested. An additional seven subjects with no history of injury to either ankle comprised Group 3 with 14 nonsprained control ankles. The experimenter tested all blindfolded subjects with active and passive attempts at replicating predetermined ankle joint positions in the inversion-eversion range of motion. An isokinetic dynamometer measured joint position. A two-way analysis of variance indicated no significant effect caused by ankle injury or noninjury. Passive judgments were significantly better than active judgments of joint position (p less than .01) in the nonsprained control group. The results suggest that joint receptors play a dominant role in joint angle detection and that muscle receptors are more valuable in the perception of joint movement.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Fifty-five patients with vascular insufficiency resulting in above-knee (AK) and through-knee (TK) amputations were studied to determine factors related to prosthetic candidacy and functional outcome. Chart review showed that the only difference between patients who were fitted with prostheses and those who were not fitted with prostheses was their respective number of medical complications. Twenty-three of 31 patients with prostheses were evaluated 7 to 35 months after receiving the prostheses. Ten (44%) of these patients wore their prostheses all day every day and used wheelchairs minimally or not at all. Over half of the patients evaluated used their wheelchairs most of the time. Two (9%) of the 23 patients had stopped wearing their prostheses. Patients who demonstrated increased walking distances and velocities at follow-up used their prostheses more and their wheelchairs less than did the other patients. Neither gait factors nor hip range of motion at discharge was predictive of continued prosthetic use. Functional outcome and prosthetic use were limited in this group of elderly patients with dysvascular AK and TK amputations. The results of this study may serve as a basis for clinical determination of prosthetic candidacy and functional goals.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of prone spinal extension exercises for increasing passive lumbar extension range of motion in healthy young adults. Eighteen healthy female and 18 healthy male volunteers were divided randomly into control groups (women, n = 10; men, n = 8) and experimental groups (women, n = 8; men, n = 10). The experimental groups performed 20 repetitions of a prone extension exercise each day for four weeks; the control groups did not. We used spondylometry to measure lumbar extension ROM. The exercises produced a significant difference (p less than .025) in the passive lumbar extension ROM between the male experimental and control groups preventing a loss of spinal mobility in the men who exercised. Analysis of the data revealed no significant difference between the female groups. The results are discussed in light of the clinical significance of lumbar extension ROM. We suggest further studies to examine the effects of lumbar extension exercises on patients with restricted ROM and low back pain.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to collect data on interexaminer reliability of a set of tests representative of the clinical examination of a patient with neck and radicular pain. A conventional neurological examination, palpations, and tests for the provocation or relief of radicular symptoms were performed on 52 patients by two independent raters. Good reliability was obtained in the atrophy inspection of the small muscles of the hand, in the sensitivity tests for touch and pain, and in the neck compression and axial manual traction tests. Fair reliability was obtained in muscle strength testing and in the estimation of the range of motion, and poor reliability was obtained for many palpations. Poor standardization of examination procedures and changes in the patients' attention were considered the main factors affecting reliability. Better operational definitions and procedures, such as the standardization of palpation pressure and traction force, are suggested for future studies.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of knee extensor muscle torque tracings in patients suspected of having damage to the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint. The knee extensor torque tracings of 30 patients suspected of having anterior instability of the knee joint were reviewed independently for abnormalities believed to be associated with anterior cruciate ligament damage. These results were compared blindly with an arthroscopic evaluation. The diagnostic accuracy of the torque tracing approach was determined by calculating the prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be 25.0% and 85.7%, respectively. These results suggest that the curve patterns examined in this article have poor diagnostic accuracy and are of little benefit as a clinical diagnostic aid.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this case report is to document the successful healing of a chronic neuropathic plantar ulcer with the molded double-rocker plaster shoe (MDRPS) in a lower extremity that also had stasis changes and poor blood flow. The patient was a 67-year-old woman with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, insensitive feet, a right ankle-arm index of 0.48, and an ulcer beneath the right cuneonavicular joint measuring 0.94 cm2 in area and 2 mm deep. Reported onset of the ulcer was 10 months before referral for physical therapy. The MDRPS was chosen as an alternative treatment to conventional below-knee total contact casting (TCC) because of the stasis changes and fragile skin in the patient's lower extremities. The ulcer healed in 39 days after initiating treatment with the MDRPS. We consider the MDRPS the preferred treatment with those patients with neuropathic plantar ulcers who cannot tolerate the below-knee TCC.</ABSTRACT>

The department's inputs (clinician and staff hours worked), outputs (patient visits, patient procedures, hours charged, and dollars charged), and productivity (staff utilization, financially productive time, and dollars charged per staff hours worked) were monitored. Pearson product-moment correlations, partial correlations, and linear regression statistics were calculated to determine the relationships between the variables measured. During the 30-month period studied, average daily census of the institution decreased, clinician hours worked decreased, patient procedures and dollars charged increased, and the three productivity measures increased. The relationship between output measures and clinician hours worked was apparent only after the effects of increased productivity were controlled. Departmental outputs and productivity were independent of the institution's census. The findings provided no evidence that decisions regarding staffing should be based on institutional census.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Maxillary hypoplasia secondary to midfacial trauma in childhood.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three normal children who suffered midfacial trauma and developed midfacial retrusion that would require Le Fort III advancements for correction of the deformity are described. The common denominator in these three cases seems to be an injury to the medial facial structure including the nasal septum. It is concluded that midfacial fractures in childhood may be a cause of subsequent midfacial hypoplasia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Frontal sinus fractures: guidelines to management.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The appropriate management of frontal sinus fractures is controversial. Experience with 78 frontal sinus fractures over a 9-year period was reviewed, and the fractures were classified into anterior wall, anterobasilar, and frontal skull fracture extensions. The presence of a concomitant CSF leak or an air-fluid level in the sinus was a diagnostic clue of posterior wall involvement. Ablation or obliteration of the fractured frontal sinus is not necessary. Primary reconstruction of the sinus and nasofrontal duct drainage constitute the preferred treatment. "Cranialization" of a severely damaged sinus is performed by excision of the posterior wall plugging of the nasofrontal duct and reconstruction of the anterior wall. Reconstruction of the anterior wall with primary bone grafting may be necessary in selected patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Unilateral cleft lip repair.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The marking of the medial lip segment of the Millard rotation advancement procedure for repair of the unilateral cleft lip has been altered in the uppermost portion by utilizing tissue from the columellar base. Once adequate length has been obtained, cutback is utilized at approximately 90 degrees. With adequate full-thickness release of this medial lip segment and subsequent rotation into the proper position, the C flap is advanced into the donor defect of the columellar base and is also used to lengthen the shortened columella on the cleft side. This results in placement of a scar that will closely simulate the "mirror image" of the noninvolved philtral column. Fifty-seven patients with unilateral cleft lip have been repaired utilizing this technique during the past 14 years. Several of these children have required secondary surgeries because of mucosal irregularities or residual nasal deformities, but none has required additional surgery because of inadequate rotation of the medial lip segment or for correction of any donor-site defect at the base of the columella.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hemifacial microsomia: a multisystem classification.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Variability of deformities in hemifacial microsomia has precluded the general acceptance of any classification based on one reference organ. We present a review of hemifacial microsomia classifications and propose a TNM-style multisystem classification. This alphanumeric coding system, SAT, provides cohesion to existing hemifacial microsomia classifications. The acronym SAT is derived as follows: S = skeletal, A = auricle, and T = soft tissue. There are five levels of skeletal deformity (S1 through S5), four levels of auricular deformity (A0 through A3), and three levels of soft-tissue deformity (T1 through T3). Hence a patient with minimal deformity would be classified S1A0T1, whereas a patient with the most severe deformity would be S5A3T3.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prosthetic replacement of the condylar head for temporomandibular joint disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Temporomandibular joint replacement was performed in 8 adults who had intraarticular ankylosis, 6 who had end-stage osteoarthritis, and 12 who had rheumatoid arthritis. Three methods of replacement were used; an ulnar head prosthesis (8 patients), an interpositional implant (11 patients), and a Proplast-coated metallic prosthesis (7 patients). The mean age of the 26 patients (19 women and 7 men) at surgery was 38 years (range 17 to 58 years), and the mean follow-up was 36 months (range 3 to 84 months). Relief of pain was experienced by 23 patients, and maintenance or improvement of incisal opening was experienced by 21. Prosthetic replacement of the condylar head for end-stage disease is highly successful in the patients for whom it is indicated.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A study of volumes of the right and left breasts of 248 subjects was undertaken using biostereometric analysis. This measurement technique uses close-range stereophotogrammetry to characterize the shape of the breast and is noncontact, noninvasive, accurate, and rapid with respect to the subject involvement time. Volumes and volumetric differences between breast pairs were compared, using chi-square tests, with handedness, perception of breast size by each subject, age, and menstrual status. No significant relationship was found between the handedness of the subject and the larger breast volume. Several groups of subjects based on age and menstrual status were accurate in their perception of breast size difference. Analysis did not confirm the generally accepted clinical impression of left breast volume dominance. Although a size difference in breast pairs was documented, neither breast predominated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expansion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between October of 1983 and June of 1985, 31 patients underwent primary breast reconstruction with tissue expansion. Tissue expansion was utilized for breast reconstruction when the remaining muscle and skin following modified radical mastectomy was insufficient to accommodate a prosthesis that matched in size and shape the opposite breast. All expanders were placed beneath an investing muscular pocket created by elevating the pectoralis major and serratus anterior. Postoperative expansion began within 1 week, and the breast was expanded to double the volume of the opposite breast. Twenty-two patients have completed their reconstruction with a mean follow-up in 7 months. There were nine complications, including five deflations and four infections. All patients have remained Baker I or Baker II. Creating ptosis to match the breast was accomplished by placing the expander below the rectus fascia and superiorly advancing this expanded tissue at the time of prosthesis placement. Primary breast reconstruction with tissue expansion following modified radical mastectomy is safe, simple, and produces a breast with excellent shape, size, texture, and patient satisfaction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Maximum overinflation of tissue expanders.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An ex vivo study was undertaken to document the maximum possible overinflation of tissue expanders with a comparison of all major manufacturers. Ten standard round implants from each vendor were expanded. Mean overinflation varied from 33 to 99 times stated capacity, with a range from 16 to 157 times this volume. The mechanism of failure in 93 percent of implants was envelope rupture. Overexpansion appears safe without risk of implant failure at least to 15 times vendors' stated maximum volume.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Rapid elongation of arteries and veins in rats with a tissue expander.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The saphenous arteries and veins of 40 rats were elongated with 20-cc tissue expanders underlying the leg adductor muscles. The mean rate of successful elongation of the vessels was 84 +/- 47 percent SD, with a maximum gain of 140 percent. The fastest mean elongation velocity reached 45 percent per day. Thrombosis occurred only with stretching velocities of more than 10 percent per day, which seemed to be a safe margin. Distribution of the volume into many intervals was safer than infrequent high-volume injections. Histology showed no reduction in vessel wall diameter or loss intimal integrity. Subendothelial cellular proliferation was an indicator of this rapid regeneration. Microvascular anastomoses performed in elongated arteries and veins had the same patency rate (90 percent) as in controls.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The ability of oxygenated fluorocarbon solution to minimize ischemic skeletal muscle injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The amputated canine limb was used to create a devascularized skeletal-muscle-containing model. The extremity was perfused with one of several solutions or merely cooled as a preservative measure during the devascularized period and then replanted. Perfusion of the limb with oxygenated fluorocarbon solution minimized edema formation and leakage of skeletal muscle enzymes into the serum following revascularization as compared to the other perfusates or to mere cooling. Histopathologic changes within the revascularized muscle were also minimized by the oxygenated fluorocarbon perfusion. It is probable that these findings will correlate with improved function of replanted extremities or free muscle flaps. The applicability of these findings to human extremity replantation and free-flap transfer is postulated. However, long-term human studies will be necessary to assess the function of extremities and flaps perfused with this solution prior to its general use in extremity replantation and free-flap transfer.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of perfusion washout in limb revascularization procedures.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Amputated rat hindlimbs were subjected to either normothermic (26 degrees C) or hypothermic (4 degrees C) ischemia. Experimental limbs had their microcirculation washed out (either before or after the ischemic insult) with a physiologic acellular plasma substitute previously reported to enhance flap survival following extended periods of warm ischemia. Control limbs were not washed out; i.e., stagnant blood remained in these limbs. Following the ischemic interval, amputated limbs were replanted. Monastral blue B, a colloidal pigment capable of labeling leaky blood vessels, was administered systemically to all rats just prior to vascular declamping. Limb biopsies of skin and muscle were harvested 30 minutes following revascularization in order to assess Monastral labeling and, therefore, the functional integrity of the microcirculation. Results confirm that stagnant blood under conditions of warm ischemia is detrimental to the functionality of the microcirculation in both skin (p less than 0.03) and muscle (p less than 0.007). Accordingly, perfusion washout, when performed prior to the ischemic period, enhances limb survival following 6 hours of warm ischemia (p less than 0.01). Hypothermia protects against the detrimental effects of stagnant blood; perfusion offers no benefit if hypothermic conditions prevail. Physiologic mechanisms responsible for these findings are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

- The implant injector allows an augmentation of the breast through very small incisions with silicone gel implants without endangering them mechanically. This way the risk of damaging nerves in the axillary region is minimal, operation time is shortened, and the visible scar can be reduced considerably. Contamination of the prosthesis by the skin is avoided. Lubrication of the implant injector by peanut oil (arachis oil) is necessary. Tissue reaction induced by the oil had never been seen. None of the implants broke while using the implant injector.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intramedullary spinal cord metastases: a clinical and pathological study of nine cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical and pathological findings in nine cases of intramedullary spinal cord metastases are reported and are compared with those of previous studies. Intramedullary metastases are more common than is generally believed and the incidence is probably increasing with the more prolonged survival of cancer patients. A wide spectrum of symptoms and signs may be produced, frequently with attendant diagnostic difficulties. Most patients present with myelopathy as the first manifestation of cancer or of its recurrence. Symptoms may be present for several months, with few clinical signs, despite distortion and destruction of much of the spinal cord by tumour. The extent of metastatic disease remains limited in a significant proportion of patients. No neurological symptoms or signs differentiate intramedullary metastases clearly from the more common extradural deposits. However, the diagnosis should be considered when myelopathy evolves more slowly, where plain radiographic evidence of adjacent vertebral disease is absent, and particularly when myelography is normal. Early diagnosis and aggressive medical treatment may provide for a more favourable outcome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fifty cases of primary hyperaldosteronism in Hong Kong Chinese with a high frequency of periodic paralysis. Evaluation of techniques for tumour localisation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifty consecutive Chinese patients with primary hyperaldosteronism were studied. All were considered to have an adrenal cortical adenoma, this being proven by surgery in 46 cases. In contrast to other reports, periodic paralysis was a presenting feature in 42 per cent of patients. Other notable symptoms were palpitations (30 per cent) and syncope (12 per cent). Vascular complications were present in 20 per cent of cases. Mean serum potassium level at presentation was 2.1 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SEM) and sodium 145.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/l. Serum potassium was significantly lower and plasma aldosterone higher in patients with periodic paralysis. Adrenal venography in order to localise the tumour was unreliable and was misleading in two cases. Adrenal venous sampling for steroid analysis was much more helpful, despite the difficulty of obtaining right adrenal venous blood. The side of the adenoma could be predicted in 97 per cent of cases from measurements of left adrenal venous and vena caval aldosterone levels. The use of high resolution CT gave 100 per cent accuracy in all 18 patients who underwent surgery, the smallest detected tumour being 0.8 cm in diameter. Surgery corrected hypokalaemia in all cases, and 37 of the 46 patients required no further antihypertensive treatment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adult-onset Still's disease; clinical and laboratory features, treatment and progress of 45 cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical and laboratory features, treatment, prognosis, complications and disability of 45 patients with adult-onset Still's disease were studied. Sixty per cent of the patients were female. Median age at onset was 25 years and median observation period after onset was 41 months. For 28 patients detailed data were available of the first month of illness. In only 43 per cent of these did the disease present with the classical triad of fever, arthritis and rash, although in the whole group eventually, fever with temperatures of 40 degrees C or more occurred in 84 per cent, arthritis in 98 per cent, and the typical rash in 82 per cent. In 32 per cent of the patients with rash, this was pruritic. Other features seen frequently were: lymphadenopathy (71 per cent), splenomegaly (36 per cent), pleuritis and/or pneumonitis (31 per cent), pericarditis (22 per cent), leucocytosis (98 per cent) and hepatic abnormalities (84 per cent). The high spiking fever was reduced to normal in six of 21 cases (29 per cent) by aspirin, in 19 of 27 cases (70 per cent) by indomethacin and in six of seven cases (86 per cent) by naproxen. In 16 of 21 cases (76 per cent) glucocorticoids reduced the systemic and/or joint symptoms. In three patients who remained febrile on glucocorticoids, indomethacin reduced temperature to normal. Eight patients whose joint disease improved on steroids later developed severe joint destructions. Thirteen patients received one or several slow-acting antirheumatic drugs. Only in eight of 18 trials (44 per cent) with one of these drugs did symptoms and signs improve. Fifty-one per cent of the 45 patients had self-limiting disease and 49 per cent had persistent disease with continuous activity for at least one year. At the time of evaluation 47 per cent of the 45 patients were in remission without medication, 33 per cent were in remission while on medication and 20 per cent had active disease. Three life-threatening complications occurred: two patients developed signs of cardiac tamponade and one almost died from diffuse intravascular coagulation. Disability was determined primarily by the course of the arthritis. At the time of review 43 per cent of the 45 patients had no joint destruction (Group 1), 24 per cent had destruction of at least one joint, but had no evidence of disease of the root joints (Group 2) and 33 per cent had destruction in at least one root joint (Group 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment of phenobarbitone poisoning with repeated oral administration of activated charcoal.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Six patients with moderate to severe phenobarbitone intoxication were treated with repeated oral doses (50 g) of activated charcoal following an initial dose of 50 to 100 g. All recovered more rapidly than would otherwise be expected with supportive care alone. The mean maximum rate of fall in plasma phenobarbitone concentrations corresponded to a half-life of only 6.2 +/- 2.5 h (normally three to five days); 62 to 93 per cent of the absorbed dose was eliminated within 24 h and the mean total body clearance of the drug during and for up to 12 h after administration of charcoal was 84 +/- 34 ml/min. Treatment with repeated oral doses of activated charcoal is simple and safe. It seems to be as effective as forced alkaline diuresis, haemodialysis and haemoperfusion for the removal of phenobarbitone following overdosage.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The blood pressure response to unilateral adrenalectomy in primary aldosteronism.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The factors determining the outcome of blood pressure after removal of the aldosterone-secreting adenoma in primary aldosteronism are largely unknown. We have studied the results of surgery in 21 patients with this disorder, all of whom were investigated and treated in a single referral centre, and evaluated the contributions of clinical, biochemical and pathological factors to blood pressure outcome. Blood pressure before surgery was high (mean 210/121 mmHg), but after an average period of 5.4 years 12 patients (60 per cent) were considered by their primary physician not to require antihypertensive medication and a further seven had reduced drug requirements. In only two patients was arterial pressure unimproved by surgery. Blood pressure recordings within six months of surgery were not a good predictor of later levels. Of the clinical, electrolyte, hormone and pathological features assessed, only the systolic pressure before surgery, and abnormalities in the optic fundi, correlated statistically with final blood pressure ranking. There was no relationship between the severity of vascular changes in the adrenal or kidney biopsy tissue and final blood pressure. These results show that while the blood pressure response to the removal of a single adrenal adenoma is usually good, it is not possible to predict accurately the final blood pressure response using these criteria.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with desferrioxamine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Desferrioxamine was used to treat six patients who had rheumatoid arthritis refractory to conventional treatment, on the basis that levels of intra-articular iron would be reduced and inflammation lessened. After a period of initial intensive treatment which was limited by side effects, five patients continued on once-weekly maintenance doses. Two patients had temporary improvement in their symptoms, but relapsed in spite of continuing treatment. The remaining three patients completed six months of treatment with no improvement in their rheumatoid disease. There were no significant changes in rheumatological parameters, immunological markers of disease activity nor radiological evidence of improvement. Treatment did lead to significant falls in haemoglobin concentration (p less than 0.01), mean corpuscular volume (p less than 0.05) and serum ferritin levels (p less than 0.02). Therefore, in spite of a reduction in iron available for haem synthesis and a fall in tissue storage iron the rheumatoid inflammatory process persisted.</ABSTRACT>

- The case of a young man with a previously undescribed myopathy associated with polydactyly is reported. Although both limb girdles were affected, the major effect of the disease was upon the respiratory muscles leading to his presentation with life-threatening respiratory failure. A further feature was pronounced stiffness of the vertebral column and limb girdles, similar in some respects to the 'rigid spine syndrome'. Muscle biopsy appearances were unique but showed some similarities to both nemaline myopathy and myotonic dystrophy. Ventilatory assistance at night using a rocking bed led to a marked improvement and has enabled the patient to return to full-time employment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hepatocellular carcinoma and the hepatitis B virus: a study of British patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have examined the relationship between hepatitis B virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma in a series of 50 British patients with histologically-proven hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum HBsAg was detected in 10 patients (20 per cent), and of the remainder, 21 per cent of those tested had serological evidence of past hepatitis B virus exposure. None of nine tumour specimens from serum HBsAg negative patients had detectable HBV-DNA integration into the tumour cell genome. The presence or absence of serum HBsAg was of no prognostic significance in British patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver cell dysplasia, a possible pre-malignant lesion, was noted in 53 per cent of patients who had had liver biopsies before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in 79 per cent of biopsies taken at the time of diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The presence of liver cell dysplasia was not more common in serum HBsAg positive patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Non-convulsive status epilepticus: a prospective study in an adult general hospital.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A prospective study of non-convulsive status epilepticus was undertaken in order to evaluate the occurrence and characteristics of this condition in adults. The diagnosis was established in 22 of 113 patients (19 per cent) presenting with status epilepticus over a 23-month period. Non-convulsive status was most prevalent in the over 60 age group. Its two subgroups, absence status (18 cases) and complex partial status (four cases) were both manifest clinically by a prolonged alteration of consciousness of variable extent. Absence status presented de novo (six cases) or against a background of epilepsy (12 cases), often with a long seizure-free interval before presentation. Precipitating factors included infection, inadequate anticonvulsant medication and benzodiazepine withdrawal. The clouding of consciousness was usually characterised by confusion, disorientation and partial responsiveness. Myoclonic or clonic movements of the eyes, face or jaw were evident in all but two patients. Automatisms, including ambulatory behaviour (three cases) were less common. Serious psychiatric disorders preceded the status in seven cases, and contributed to the difficulty in diagnosis. Complex partial status was associated with underlying cerebrovascular disease in three of four cases, and is characterised by a more severe and variable clouding of consciousness, less frequent facial clonic movements, episodic adversive head and eye movements, and a more gradual recovery after treatment.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Psoriatic arthritis (PSA)--an analysis of 220 patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Since 1978, 220 patients with psoriatic arthritis have undergone detailed study at the Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Clinical, radiological and biochemical data were subjected to computer analysis in order to determine clinical-biochemical correlations within subsets of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Our findings indicate a spectrum of disease patterns and severity. Overall, we found a 40 per cent incidence of deforming, erosive arthropathy, with 17 per cent of patients having five or more deformed joints. ARA stage 3 and 4 radiological joint change occurred in 28 and 14 per cent respectively, and 11 per cent of patients had ARA Class III or IV functional impairment. The asymmetric oligoarthritis previously reported to account for the majority of cases of psoriatic arthritis was not a dominant pattern in our own experience, occurring in only 28 per cent of the series. Polyarthritis was the most common joint pattern, present in 61 per cent with symmetric and asymmetric patterns occurring equally. Our experience suggests that polyarthritis, symmetric or asymmetric, is a more common presentation of the disease than is generally acknowledged. Furthermore, the frequency of deforming destructive arthropathy challenges the concept of psoriatic arthritis as a benign arthropathy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metastatic adeno or undifferentiated carcinoma from an unknown primary site--natural history and guidelines for identification of treatable subsets.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two hundred and eighty-six patients presenting with metastatic adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma whose primary site was not identified by clinical history, physical examination and chest radiograph have been studied. Median survival from presentation was 22 weeks. Factors independently predicting improved survival were lymph node presentations, good performance status and body weight loss of less than 10 per cent. In 88 (31 per cent) patients the primary tumour site was subsequently identified, in 58 (20 per cent) during life. Lung cancer was the most frequently identified primary tumour, and in only 32 (11 per cent) of the patients was a 'treatable' primary tumour (i.e. germ cell, breast, ovarian, prostate, thyroid cancer or lymphoma) identified. Among the treatable primary tumours were those in eight out of 16 female patients presenting with axillary metastases who were subsequently shown to have primary breast cancer and four of 13 females presenting with ascites who were found to have primary ovarian cancer. Prostatic cancer was confirmed in five out of 13 men with raised serum acid phosphatase. Of 22 patients with elevated serum alphafoetoprotein (AFP) or beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels (beta HCG) 18 had some features of the 'atypical teratoma syndrome'. Of the total of 32 patients with treatable tumour types, 29 (90 per cent) were identified during life. Median survival for patients with treatable tumour types identified during life was 104 weeks, compared with 22 weeks for the group as a whole. Retrospective immunocytochemical staining of the original biopsy showed that prostatic specific antigen and antibodies to beta HCG and AFP were diagnostically useful, but a series of organ site non-specific markers of histogenesis or cellular differentiation (carcinoembryonic antigen, secretory component for IgA, peanut lectin binding, epithelial membrane antigen and keratin) showed no significant correlations with identified primary sites, responsiveness to empirical chemotherapy or survival. Metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma or adenocarcinoma from an unknown primary site represents 6.5 per cent of all referrals to the medical oncology unit, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. We offer guidelines for the rapid identification of the limited number of primary sites for which effective and specific forms of systemic treatment are available.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lupus nephritis: clinical and pathological correlation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical course of 135 patients with lupus nephritis was examined long-term as part of a prospective study. Biopsies were classified according to modified WHO criteria and showed 17 per cent of patients had mild mesangial lesions, 10 per cent focal lesions, 21 per cent mild diffuse proliferative lesions, 37 per cent severe diffuse proliferative lesions and 15 per cent membranous lesions. Overall patient survival of 83 and 65 per cent at five and 10 years respectively from onset of nephritis was similar to other recently published series. In contrast to the latter, the severe proliferative group had a significantly worse outcome than the other proliferative groups (p less than 0.01) and only patients in this group progressed to end-stage renal failure. Haematuria was more common (p less than 0.05) in the severe group and there was a striking correlation between histologic activity assessed semiquantitatively (Table 1) and urinary red cell count (p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between serum creatinine, proteinuria or chronic lesions with urinary red cell count. In contrast to a previous study there was no correlation between the presence of hyaline thrombi on initial biopsy and subsequent development of glomerular sclerosis. Although the value of renal biopsy has been questioned, we suggest that it remains a most important investigation in the management of lupus nephritis. Determination of urinary red cell count provides a most useful monitor of disease activity and response to treatment.</ABSTRACT>

- We report data on 43 patients with polyarteritis affecting the kidneys. The majority (41 patients) had renal histological evidence of microscopic polyarteritis. Although most patients (30 of 43) had significant renal impairment at the time of diagnosis (serum creatinine greater than 250 mumol/l) only five had a symptom, macroscopic haematuria, that directed attention to the kidneys. In the majority of patients in whom data was available there was rapid deterioration in renal function between presentation and diagnosis. Renal function at diagnosis was worse in patients aged over 50 of whom 20 out of 29 had a serum creatinine greater than 500 mumol/l compared with only four of 14 patients aged less than 50. The prognosis was worse in patients over 50 (41 per cent died), in patients with a serum creatinine higher than 500 mumol/l (54 per cent died) and in patients treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, (four also had intravenous cyclophosphamide) (38 per cent died). The major cause of death was sepsis and the actuarial one-year survival was 62 per cent. These results suggest that our approach to treatment should be modified towards lessening immunosuppression in older patients and in patients with renal failure at diagnosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment of tuberculous meningitis: role of short-course chemotherapy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-eight adult patients admitted consecutively with tuberculous meningitis were treated with pyrazinamide, isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin daily during the first two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin daily for seven months with intensive management of the complications during the active stage of the meningitis. Twenty-two patients completed the course of treatment and recovered with minimal morbidity in three patients. Two patients died in a vegetative state from other causes seven and nine months after the start of treatment. No evidence of recurrence of meningitis was observed in the 21 patients who were regularly observed for 12 to 29 months after completing treatment. Four patients dropped out during the early stage of treatment. Intensive chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis with this regimen before the development of serious neurological damage can shorten the duration of treatment to nine months with a favourable outcome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty improves blood pressure and renal function in renovascular hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-three patients with renal angiographic evidence of significant renal artery stenosis were referred for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The indications were poorly controlled hypertension (n = 13) or hypertension associated with deteriorating renal function (n = 20). Their mean age was 56 (23-73) years (12 males, 21 females). Causes of the renal artery stenosis were fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 8) and atheromatous changes (n = 25). Four patients were excluded, three due to technical failure. Forty-five angioplasties were performed in 29 patients with a mean observation period after angioplasty of 18 (one to 60) months. During this period eight patients (28 per cent) had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg without antihypertensive drugs, a further 15 patients (52 per cent) had improved blood pressure control with a significant reduction in the number and amount of antihypertensive drugs, but six patients (20 per cent) showed no improvement in blood pressure. Hypertension associated with the stenosis of fibromuscular dysplasia responded better to angioplasty than hypertension associated with atheromatous renal artery stenosis. Improvement in renal function was noted in eight patients with no change in 16 patients. Two patients with end-stage renal failure and atheromatous intrarenal vascular disease became dialysis dependent within four weeks of the procedure. One major and four minor complications occurred but there were no deaths related to angioplasty. Together with results from other centres this study indicates that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty should be considered the initial treatment choice for all patients with renovascular hypertension due to fibromuscular dysplasia and atheromatous renal artery stenosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Psychiatric disorder in medical in-patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four hundred and fifty-three general medical in-patients were screened for mood disorder (anxiety and depression), organic mental states and alcohol problems. Using the Present State Examination, affective disorder was identified in 14.6 per cent, being especially common in younger women. Organic psychiatric disorder was very common in the elderly, occurring in 31 per cent of those over 70 years, and 18 per cent of men and 4 per cent of women admitted to a drink problem. Mood disorder was not related to the type or severity of physical illness, but was significantly associated with previous psychiatric history and social problems. Two-thirds of those with mood disorder on admission who were still alive four months after discharge were improved. House officers and family doctors identified approximately half the cases of depression and anxiety, but house officers were no more likely to recognise the more severe cases than the milder ones. Organic psychiatric disorder was often missed, alcohol problems less so.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The importance of limited exposure to ultraviolet radiation and dietary factors in the aetiology of Asian rickets: a risk-factor model.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Regional variation in the prevalence of Asian rickets was examined in Coventry, Bradford and Glasgow. Records of 152 weeks of daylight outdoor exposure were obtained from 104 Glasgow Asian children, 53 of whom had been treated for rickets. Records of seven-day weighed dietary intake were obtained from 84 Asian children, 43 of whom had been treated for rickets. There was a marked north-south gradient in the prevalence of Asian rickets. In all cases of severe rickets with deformity the child was vegetarian. Severe rickets was associated with lower intake of meat, higher intake of chapati and lower daylight outdoor exposure values than in normal children. Multivariate analysis employing a combination of these variables provided good separation between rachitic and normal groups. A risk-factor model is proposed which suggests that regional variation in the prevalence of rickets among Asian communities in Britain is mainly determined by the effects of latitude and the nature of the urban environment on available ultraviolet radiation. Where UV radiation is restricted, individual propensity to rickets within a given Asian community is mainly determined by dietary factors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Variation in mortality from ischaemic heart disease between England and Scotland.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A comparison of mortality from ischaemic heart disease under the age of 60 for 1980 to 1981 between the Grampian Health Board and the North Staffordshire Health Authority has been made. A total of 993 deaths was notified by death certificate from the two areas of similar population of which 434 were from Grampian and 559 from North Staffordshire. After examination of general practitioner and hospital case notes, autopsy reports and death certificates, nearly all (532) of the North Staffordshire deaths were accepted as being due to ischaemic heart disease but only three-fifths (263) of the Grampian deaths could be substantiated as there was inadequate information for the remainder. Deaths from ischaemic heart disease seem apparently to be twofold greater in North Staffordshire than Grampian but much of this discrepancy could be attributed to a widely different autopsy rate and to unavailability of case notes. Experience of this survey suggests that the results of other epidemiological investigations may be equally or even more unreliable.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Symptomatic intracranial tuberculoma developing during treatment of tuberculosis: a report of 10 patients and review of the literature.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ten patients with intracranial tuberculomata which developed during treatment for tuberculosis are described. The initial infection was meningeal in five, miliary in three and pulmonary in two and all improved after treatment was started. However 10 days to five months (mean two months) after the start of treatment, new neurological symptoms and/or signs occurred that led to the recognition of intracranial tuberculomata. CT brain scans suggested tuberculomata in all 10 patients; there were several lesions in five and histological confirmation was obtained in three cases. Earlier CT brain scans (six weeks to five months before) were carried out in five patients and in none was a tuberculoma seen. After treatment with anti-tuberculous drugs and control of raised intracranial pressure when present, five patients made a full recovery, three were left with mild neurological deficit and in two it is too early to assess the outcome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tumoral calcinosis: clinical and metabolic response to phosphorus deprivation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two patients with extensive tumoral calcinosis were treated with aluminium hydroxide. Initial metabolic studies showed positive calcium and phosphorus balances which became negative with aluminium hydroxide treatment. One subject, who had renal impairment, developed transient hypercalcaemia, parathyroid suppression, low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and calcium malabsorption during treatment with aluminium hydroxide. The second patient developed calcium malabsorption due to vitamin D deficiency. When she was replete with vitamin D there were supranormal levels of 1,25-(OH)2D in the serum and enhanced calcium absorption during treatment with aluminium hydroxide. Both subjects developed hypercalciuria and there was dissolution of many of the calcific tumours. The patient with renal impairment accumulated aluminium in the bone.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Investigation of anterior pituitary function in elderly in-patients over the age of 75.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Dynamic pituitary function tests were carried out on 50 randomly selected in-patients, (30 women and 20 men) over the age of 75 during early convalescence. Twenty-five subjects also had CT scans of the pituitary fossa. One male patient had hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism; another had a large prolactinoma and hypothyroidism; these were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 48 subjects, 14 (29 per cent) had reduced TSH responses to TRH and 28 (64 per cent) decreased GH responses to L-dopa compared with our laboratory's reference ranges. Fifteen women (51 per cent) had low basal gonadotrophin levels of which 10 (34 per cent) gave a poor LH response to LHRH and eight (27 per cent) a poor FSH response. Forty-three subjects (93 per cent) gave a good ACTH response to metyrapone. Only six subjects (24 per cent) had an apparently normal pituitary fossa; 16 (64 per cent) had partially or completely empty fossas. There was no significant correlation between the diminished pituitary responses. Only one patient had responses which suggested panhypopituitarism. There was also no significant correlation between the appearance on CT scan of the pituitary fossa and the results of the dynamic tests. It is suggested that laboratory reference range for pituitary function which have been derived from young ambulatory subjects are not appropriate for hospital in-patients over the age of 75. A series of reference ranges for such subjects is proposed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A prospective study of hepatic tuberculosis in 41 black patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Forty-one black patients aged 21 to 75 years with hepatic tuberculosis diagnosed at liver biopsy were studied prospectively. The liver varied in size and consistency and was tender in 44 per cent of patients. Abdominal symptoms, weight loss, pyrexia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and anaemia were absent in 54, 39, 37, 5, 68 and 27 per cent of patients respectively. Twenty-two per cent of chest radiographs were normal. Liver function tests were of little diagnostic value and hepatic imaging techniques often gave normal results. Acid-fast bacilli, caseation and coexistent liver disease were detected in 59, 51 and 37 per cent of patients respectively. Since there was no consistent clinical pattern a high index of suspicion is necessary if this disease is to be detected in communities in which tuberculosis is endemic. In patients with unexplained hepatomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly or pyrexia of unknown origin liver biopsy provides the only means of making this diagnosis.</ABSTRACT>

Three of these patients died from fulminant sepsis, and one patient who had meningitis was left with serious neurological sequelae. All eight patients had had splenectomy or splenic irradiation for haematological disease. Str. pneumoniae was the commonest infecting organism. There were 1579 other bacteraemic episodes seen at University Hospital, Nottingham during the same period.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Xeroradiography of the breast: overview of 21,057 consecutive cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Xeroradiography was performed on 21,057 new patients referred over a 5 1/2-year period. For purposes of analysis, mammograms reported as "benign" or "follow-up suggested" were considered negative and those reported as "suspicious" or "strongly suggestive of cancer" were considered positive. All patients were followed up for 12 months. After 6 months, 773 breast cancers were diagnosed. An additional 19 cancers were proved to exist during the 6-12-month period. The cancer rate increased progressively with age and ranged from 1.2% at age 30-39 years, to 4.5% at age 50-59 years, to 11.8% at age 70 years and over. Mammography had a sensitivity of 91.1%, a specificity of 89.9%, and a predictive value of 25.5%. Sensitivity increased with age, ranging from 78.5% at age 30-39 to 95.1% at age 70 and over. Predictive value increased dramatically with age, varying from 12.4% at age 30-39, to 28.4% at age 50-59, to 49.4% at age 70 years and over.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A simple classification system for mammographic reporting.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A simple classification system for reporting mammograms is described, similar in format to a system formerly used for reporting Papanicolaou smears. Class 1 indicates an examination with normal findings. Class 2 indicates findings of a mass or masses that appear to be benign. Class 3 indicates findings of an indeterminate lesion, suggestive of possible malignancy. Class 4 indicates probable malignancy. Advantages of the classification system include effective triage of patients and easier computerized record keeping for long-term tracking.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nonpalpable breast lesions: accuracy of prebiopsy mammographic diagnosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Mammograms of 220 patients who underwent spot localization for removal of nonpalpable breast lesions were reviewed for accuracy of interpretation. Results of subsequent biopsy indicated malignancy in 77 cases. The interpretations of mammograms obtained before biopsy were incorrect in 71 cases (27 false-negative and 44 false-positive studies). Among the false-negative cases, 70% of the abnormalities were determined histologically to be noninfiltrative cancers. An aggressive screening program with preoperative localization and biopsy is needed in questionable cases, since mammographic signs of early or nonpalpable malignancy are often subtle and nonspecific.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Epipericardial fat pad: CT findings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Epicardial and mediastinal fat around the apex of the heart may produce the classic appearance of a cardiac fat pad filling in the anterior cardiophrenic angle on a lateral chest radiograph. A review of 50 computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest that were normal save for possible cardiomegaly, together with chest radiographs obtained within a 14-day interval, revealed a wide variation in the configuration of this fat pad in 16 patients (32%). Depending on geometric circumstances, the fat pad may produce a well-marginated region of increased density, a region of increased density with poor margination, or an area of reduced density lying anterior to the heart. In an additional four patients (8%), however, a simulation of a cardiac fat pad was produced by cardiomegaly alone or by relative levoposition of the heart. In these four patients, the left side of the heart contacted the chest wall on the left over a larger than normal area and thereby excluded lung from the vicinity, simulating the appearance of a fat pad where none existed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Preoperative chest radiography: value as a baseline examination for comparison.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An important use of the preoperative chest radiograph is as a baseline for comparison when complications occur after surgery. Many authors have commented on the value of preoperative chest radiography as a screening examination, but no statistics have been presented regarding its impact on postoperative management. In 369 consecutive general surgical patients, the need for a baseline chest radiograph was evaluated. In 65 patients undergoing chest radiography postoperatively, a preoperative baseline was essential in making an accurate interpretation in 33 (51%). The value of preoperative chest radiography proved to be twofold. Some minimal abnormalities on postoperative radiographs were demonstrated to be clearly new, necessitating treatment or further evaluation. Second, significant abnormalities detected on postoperative radiographs that may have otherwise been subjected to expensive evaluation were often shown to have been present preoperatively. In approximately 9% of patients the preoperative chest radiograph had a significant impact on postoperative management.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pulmonary angiography with iopamidol: patient comfort, image quality, and hemodynamics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The choice of a contrast agent for pulmonary angiography has important implications for patient comfort, image quality, and perhaps the safety of the procedure, particularly for "high-risk" patients. In a prospective study the nonionic, low-osmolality agent iopamidol eliminated the problem of image degradation due to coughing, and patients showed excellent tolerance for it. However, pressure measurements obtained within 3-5 minutes of injection of iopamidol and diatrizoate sodium meglumine 76% showed no significant difference in the hemodynamic effects of the two contrast agents, either for normotensive or for pulmonary hypertensive patients. Contrary to a common presumption, pulmonary hypertension by itself did not appear to increase the risk of pulmonary angiography. The theoretic presumption of greater hemodynamic stability with low-osmolality contrast agents was not clinically evident in this trial with iopamidol. At present, enhanced patient comfort and improved image quality remain the only confirmed bases for choosing this contrast agent for pulmonary angiography.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Deep venous thrombophlebitis: detection with 4-hour versus 24-hour platelet scintigraphy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-one nonheparinized patients with suspected deep venous thrombophlebitis (DVT) underwent contrast venography and indium-111 platelet scintigraphy (In-111 PS). Venography permitted identification of acute DVT in 12 of 31 cases (39%). One additional patient was considered to have acute DVT despite nonconclusive venography results. In-111 PS results were positive at 4 hours in nine of 13 cases (69%) and at 24 hours in 12 of 13 cases (92%). Two of four patients with false-negative 4-hour In-111 PS studies had received warfarin. Thus, the sensitivity of 4-hour In-111 PS in patients not receiving anticoagulants was 82%. Venography results were negative for acute DVT in 18 cases, and 4-hour In-111 PS studies were negative or equivocal in each. In-111 PS is an alternative to contrast venography for detecting acute DVT. If 4-hour In-111 PS results are positive, anticoagulation can be initiated. Delayed images are necessary if the 4-hour images are negative or equivocal.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Improved interpretation of exercise Tl-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in women: characterization of breast attenuation artifacts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy is reported to be a less accurate diagnostic test for coronary artery disease in women than in men. We retrospectively analyzed 34 Tl-201 studies obtained in 28 symptomatic women and compared them with those obtained in 32 men during the same interval. Three criteria were tested: criterion 1 was defined as abnormal scans showing any defect; criterion 2, scans showing only transient (reversible) defects; and criterion 3, scans showing either transient or "significant" (i.e., not due to breast attenuation) fixed defects. The sensitivity in women was 1.00, 0.73, and 0.93, respectively; the specificity, 0.26, 0.84, and 0.85. The best values in men were a sensitivity of 1.00 and a specificity of 0.86. The three criteria were then prospectively tested in 33 scans of 29 additional women. The sensitivity was 0.90, 0.65, and 0.80, respectively, and the specificity, 0.18, 1.00, and 0.92. Defects (usually fixed) due to breast attenuation artifact were seen frequently (30%). Criterion 3 best differentiates such defects from those resulting from coronary artery disease, making Tl-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy as accurate in women as in men.</ABSTRACT>

- Traumatic aortic lacerations are life-threatening injuries that require a prompt diagnosis and surgery if patients are to survive. Most authors recommend transfemoral catheterization when performing thoracic aortography in patients with suspected aortic lacerations. The authors of this study describe two patients in whom transfemoral catheterization and contrast material injection were directly related to their deaths. These cases illustrate the need for cautious catheter manipulation in patients with aortic lacerations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percutaneous transfemoral placement of the Kimray-Greenfield vena cava filter.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 109 patients in whom inferior vena caval interruption was indicated to prevent pulmonary embolism, Kimray-Greenfield (K-G) filters were inserted from a percutaneous transfemoral approach, 94 from the right common femoral vein and 15 from the left common femoral vein. All attempts at transfemoral filter insertion were successful except in two patients in whom a left common femoral approach was used. No complications occurred during insertion. In four patients, clinical evidence of femoral vein thrombosis ensued within 48 hours of filter insertion. There were no complications related to filter migration, and in 97% of patients the alignment was satisfactory. The percutaneous transfemoral route is a rapid and effective method for inserting K-G filters. The most frequent postinsertion complication was femoral vein thrombosis (ten patients), but only two patients suffered permanent sequelae.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Percutaneous insertion of the Kimray-Greenfield filter: technical considerations and problems.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Kimray-Greenfield filters were inserted percutaneously into the inferior vena cava (IVC) in 57 patients. Thirty-six were placed from the right femoral vein, 14 from the left femoral vein, and seven from the right internal jugular vein. There were no deaths or major complications and only six minor complications. Inferior vena cavography was done before filter insertion in all cases. Cavography is vital to determine feasibility of filter insertion, route of insertion, and filter location; pertinent findings include caval size, presence or absence of clot in the IVC or iliac veins, and position of the renal veins. The guide wire provided with the standard filter introduction set has a tendency to catch on the filter as the wire is withdrawn. A stiff wire with a straight, tapered, floppy tip was substituted. The femoral approach is preferred when it is feasible. Though there was only one known occurrence of femoral vein thrombosis at the filter insertion site, other cases may have occurred and may not have been detected. If the frequency of this complication proves to be significant, the preferred route for filter insertion may have to be reconsidered.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) was performed in 12 children and adolescents with renal artery stenosis. Patients were divided into three groups: those with a short stenosis in the middle or distal part of the renal artery (n = 5), those with a short stenosis at or near the origin of the renal artery (n = 3), and those with a long stenosis at or near the origin (n = 4). The patients in the first group responded to PTRA. Those in the second group had a poor clinical response, and dilation was unsuccessful in the patients in the third group, who remained hypertensive. The location and length of the renal artery stenosis and its underlying cause appear to be important in determining the results of PTRA.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Transesophageal drainage of mediastinal abscesses.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Esophageal perforation with subsequent formation of a mediastinal abscess is a well-recognized clinical entity. Causes include perforation due to rigid and fiberoptic endoscopy, bouginage, breakdown of surgical anastomoses, and protracted vomiting. This disorder is associated with a high morbidity and, without intervention, a high mortality. In the past, surgery has been the treatment of choice. Although percutaneous drainage techniques have been used in some cases, they are frequently less attractive due to the location of the esophagus and its proximity to thoracic organs and vascular structures. In this study, eight abscesses caused by esophageal perforations were drained through a transesophageal route with minimal patient morbidity. These cases are presented with a discussion of the techniques and patient follow-up.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective multi-institutional study was carried out on a series of 38 patients with histologically proved Budd-Chiari syndrome: Five patients had acute disease, and 33 had subacute or chronic disease. All patients underwent dynamic CT scanning. Angiography was performed in 20 cases, inferior cavography in 22, and wedge-hepatic venography in 16. In all acute cases, CT showed global liver enlargement with diffuse hypodensity on plain scans and patchy enhancement after contrast material injection. Thrombosis of the three main hepatic veins was always demonstrated. In subacute or chronic disease, plain CT scans showed abnormalities of liver morphology and hypodensity either in atrophic areas (19 cases) or in the periphery of the liver (eight cases). With dynamic CT, patchy enhancement was present in 28 cases. Correlation with angiography in 15 cases revealed a normal portal blood flow in enhanced areas and an inversed portal blood flow in atrophic areas. Different morphologic and enhancement patterns on CT scans could be related to the direction of portal blood flow, which changes with different stages of Budd-Chiari syndrome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regenerating nodules of liver cirrhosis: MR imaging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A large number of tiny (0.5-1.5 cm), low-intensity nodules of the liver were retrospectively observed on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of eight patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The lesions were not detected with other imaging modalities and were considered to be regenerating nodules. Twenty-five consecutive cases of liver cirrhosis referred for MR examination were prospectively investigated to study the detectability of regenerating nodules and the optimal pulse sequence for detection. A large number of small, low-intensity nodules were demonstrated in nine of 25 cases on T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) images, in nine of 22 cases on T1-T2 complex fast low-angle shot (FLASH) images, and in one of eight cases on T1-weighted SE images. FLASH images obtained with respiratory suspension most clearly revealed regenerating nodules. However, T2-weighted SE images clearly permit differentiation of high-intensity hepatocellular carcinoma, including small daughter lesions, from low-intensity regenerating nodules.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antegrade ureteral stents: technical and catheter-related problems with polyethylene and polyurethane.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Antegrade placement of polyethylene and polyurethane stents was successfully achieved in 93 of 107 ureters (87 of 101 patients). These materials functioned adequately in 24 of 26 patients with indications for temporary stenting, including fistulas, strictures, and trauma caused by manipulation of calculi. Thirty of 61 patients with malignancy (49.2%) died within 6 months with their original stents in place; 12 survived to undergo elective cystoscopic stent replacement. Fifteen of the 61 patients had premature stent occlusions, which were treated by permanent nephrostomy in nine, replacement of the stent in five, and no further diversion in one patient with lymphoma. Encrustation and stent occlusion are problems during extended use of polyethylene and polyurethane stents. Long-term patency rates with newer stent materials remain to be documented and compared.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Upper airway obstruction in infants and children: evaluation with ultrafast CT.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The diagnostic accuracy of ultrafast computed tomography (CT) was evaluated prospectively in 25 infants and children with suspected airway obstruction. All examinations were conducted in spontaneously breathing, nonsedated children. Scan acquisition times were 0.05 or 0.1 second. CT examinations, completed in an average of 10 minutes, routinely included localizing, contiguous sections through the trachea followed by serial images obtained at a rate of 17 per second through regions of interest. Imaging results were correct in 24 of 25 examinations as judged from clinical and surgical data. Ultrafast CT data permitted diagnosis of dynamic changes in airway caliber, small intraluminal polyps, focal tracheal atresia, compressive mediastinal masses, and foreign body obstructions of the major bronchi. Dose measurements showed a maximum skin exposure of 245 mR (0.06 mC/kg) per 0.05-second image. Ultrafast CT provides an accurate, minimally invasive method for dynamic imaging of the airway in nonsedated children.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Orbital dermoids: features on CT.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The computed tomographic (CT) features of orbital dermoids were retrospectively reviewed in 17 patients; 15 of the lesions were proved histologically. On the basis of clinical and CT features, the tumors were classified as superficial or deep. All but one were extraconal in location. Seven lesions appeared cystic; only six showed typical fat density. The presence of a margin or rim, often partially calcified, was identified in ten lesions. Irregular scalloping of adjacent bone was a highly suggestive feature, occurring with 11 dermoids. Other bone changes, such as linear defects, thinning, or sclerosis, also occurred. Superficial dermoids showed less apparent bone changes. An extraconal orbital lesion associated with adjacent bone thinning or notching should raise the possibility of a dermoid, especially if a rim with calcification is seen. The appearance is pathognomonic if fat density is also present.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The scans of 100 consecutive patients referred for computed tomographic examinations that included the oropharynx were reviewed with regard to calcifications of the palatine tonsillary region. Calcifications were found in 20% of the female patients and 13% of the male patients. Ten patients had one calculus, and six had two or more. The sizes of the calculi ranged from 1 to 7 mm. Tonsillary calculi must be included among the diagnostic possibilities when survey radiographs of the neck show soft-tissue calcifications.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Posterior pituitary gland: appearance on MR images in normal and pathologic states.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images of the pituitary gland and sella turcica routinely demonstrate a region of high signal intensity in the neurohypophysis. High-resolution MR imaging studies of the sella turcica in 200 subjects with a normal or abnormal sella were analyzed. The hyperintensity was found in the images of about 90% of healthy subjects and patients with microadenoma, in only 43% of patients with macroadenoma, and in 12% of patients with empty sellae. The signal was absent in several patients with functional or anatomic abnormalities of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis. It is concluded that the high signal intensity in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is present in most healthy individuals and that its absence in many patients with large intrasellar masses and empty sellae is due to compression of posterior lobe tissue. Its absence in diabetes insipidus further suggests a relationship between hyperintensity and the functional status of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Transection of the pituitary stalk: development of an ectopic posterior lobe assessed with MR imaging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed in ten patients with pituitary stalk transection who had idiopathic pituitary dwarfism. Contiguous sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained in all cases, and, in some, axial or coronal images were taken for further evaluation. On MR images, normal anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland can be clearly differentiated because the posterior lobe has a characteristic high intensity on T1-weighted images. In the ten patients, the high-intensity posterior lobe was not seen, but a similar high signal intensity was observed at the proximal stump in seven patients. This high-intensity area is the newly formed ectopic posterior lobe, which secretes antidiuretic hormone just as the posterior lobe would. When the ectopic lobe completely compensates for the impaired posterior lobe, endocrinologic data indicate normal posterior lobe function. However, MR imaging can reveal the transection of the pituitary stalk and formation of the ectopic lobe.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Rathke cleft cysts: CT, MR imaging, and pathologic features.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in seven patients with pathologically proved Rathke cleft cysts. All the cysts were located in the anterior sella turcica or the anterior suprasellar cistern. Five cysts had both intra- and suprasellar components, one was entirely intrasellar, and the other was predominantly suprasellar in location. The size of the cysts ranged from 8 to 20 mm. CT scans demonstrated low-density homogeneous lesions in four cases. On MR images of three of these four cases, the cysts had the same intensity as cerebrospinal fluid on T1- and T2-weighted images, while in the fourth case, the cyst was hyperintense on the T1-weighted images. In the remaining three cases, CT showed slight hyperdensity relative to brain parenchyma, suggestive of contrast enhancement. MR showed signal heterogeneity of these lesions with focal components of diminished signal intensity of T2-weighted images. These same foci appeared iso- to slightly hyperintense on T1-weighted images.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Adrenoleukodystrophy: correlating MR imaging with CT.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect on the brain of the sex-linked recessive form of adrenoleukodystrophy was studied in 40 boys, 4-18 years old. All underwent computed tomography (CT) scanning; six underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR showed a high sensitivity in demonstrating white matter disease. Auditory pathway disease was characterized as involvement of the lateral lemniscus and medial geniculate body, and visual pathway disease was characterized by lateral geniculate body, Meyer loop, and optic radiation involvement. Contrast-enhanced CT still proved to have a greater capacity (at this time) to show the active, advancing form of the disease and concomitant calcifications. This large CT series also demonstrated the broad and variable expressions of adrenoleukodystrophy, which allowed the unification of previously described atypical forms of the disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cerebral sparganosis: CT characteristics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cerebral sparganosis is an extremely rare parasitic zoonosis caused by a migrating plerocercoid tapeworm larva, genus Spirometra. Nineteen computed tomography (CT) scans of 12 patients with cerebral sparganosis were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with clinical and pathologic data. On CT scans, the following characteristics were noted: (a) unilateral involvement; (b) extensive or multifocal areas of low density along white matter bundles, with ipsilateral ventricular dilatation and localized cortical atrophy; (c) nodular or irregular enhancement with spotty calcification; and (d) change in location of enhancing nodules on sequential scans. These pathognomonic features reflect a chronic inflammatory process with both active granulomatous lesions and widespread degeneration of brain tissue, especially in the white matter. Degeneration is probably caused by migration of the long-surviving larva along the fiber tracts of white matter.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Thoracic disk herniation: MR imaging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors undertook a retrospective study to assess the role of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in thoracic disk herniation. The initial MR images were interpreted independently of other findings. These interpretations were compared with the findings of plain and computed tomography (CT) myelography and surgery, when available. Sixteen thoracic disk herniations were confirmed with plain and CT myelography and/or surgery. Plain myelography was performed on 14 patients and showed focal ventral filling defects in nine. Results of CT myelography were equivalent to those of MR imaging with three pulse sequences (sagittal T1 and T2 weighted, axial T1 weighted) in the identification of all the abnormal levels. In two patients, the signal from the herniated disk was so low on all sequences that thoracic disk herniation had to be inferred from the mass effect on the spinal cord. Precise location of the abnormal level with body coil MR images was achieved in six of 13 patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Normal and degenerative posterior spinal structures: MR imaging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective study of the magnetic resonance (MR) images of the lumbar spines of 13 healthy subjects and 30 patients with degenerative changes was done. In the healthy subjects, the vertebral facets, thickness of the cartilage and ligamentum flavum, signal characteristics of the bone marrow, and size of the spinal canal were studied. In the patients with degenerative changes in one of these structures, MR images in the sagittal plane were useful in demonstrating hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum or the vertebral facets, in grading the degree of foraminal stenosis, and in measuring the sagittal diameter of the spinal cord. MR images in the axial plane facilitated detailed analysis of the facet joint and more accurate measurements of the thickness of the ligamentum flavum and spinal canal diameter. MR images were compared with computed tomography scans in 12 patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Osteoporosis with vertebral compression fractures, retropulsed fragments, and neurologic compromise.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Osteoporosis frequently affects the vertebral column and causes compression fractures, biconcave ("fish-mouth") vertebrae, kyphosis, and pain. The cases are reported of three postmenopausal osteoporotic women who had neurologic symptoms of the lower extremities because of vertebral body fractures with a retropulsed fragment narrowing the spinal canal. None of the women had experienced trauma. The fractures resembled burst-type fractures that result from axial loading with major trauma. The retropulsed fragments could be seen best on computed tomographic or magnetic resonance images and were very subtle on conventional radiographs, on which an abnormal posterior vertebral body line was the only abnormality detected. This complication of osteoporosis of the spine is important to recognize so that appropriate treatment can be instituted.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acetabular fractures: optimal imaging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 19 cases of acetabular fracture, computed tomography (CT) with volumetric three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions displayed as video loops about horizontal and vertical axes of rotation replaced the traditional imaging combination of CT and multiple plain radiographs, while offering significant advantages. Overlying bowel content or foreign matter obscured detail in 36 of 45 plain radiographic views, and positioning or radiographic technique was suboptimal in 21. Three-dimensional reconstructions completely eliminated these problems. These 3D reconstructions accurately simulated oblique, inlet, and tangential views in all cases. In ten of 19 cases a nonconventional oblique view, and in 13 of 19 cases a cephalocaudal angulation other than the inlet, tangential, or anteroposterior view, best demonstrated the fracture. Elimination of five plain radiographs resulted in a skin radiation dose savings of 5 rad (50 mGy). No difficult or painful patient positioning was required beyond that necessary for the standard CT examination.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Bone marrow diseases of the spine: differentiation with T1 and T2 relaxation times in MR imaging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Forty-two patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for a variety of lesions in the vertebral body. A 0.15-T MR system was employed. Twenty-six patients were found to have malignant metastatic lesions (group 1); 16 had nonneoplastic lesions (group 2). The ability to differentiate between the two groups with MR imaging was evaluated. With the longer spin-echo repetition time, the image was variable in both groups. All malignant metastatic lesions appeared as low-intensity areas on T1-weighted images, but 50% of the nonneoplastic lesions also appeared this way. The mean T1 for group 1 was longer than that for group 2, but not significantly so. However, there were significant differences in the ratios of T1 to T2 and of the T1 ratio to the T2 ratio (T1 ratio = T1 for affected vertebrae/T1 for normal vertebrae, T2 ratio = T2 for affected vertebrae/T2 for normal vertebrae). These ratios were therefore useful in distinguishing malignant metastatic from nonneoplastic lesions.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A specific pattern of pericapitate involvement of the wrist has been described in the rheumatologic literature as characteristic of adult-onset Still disease (AOSD), a relatively rare disorder that is often diagnosed by exclusion after extensive and frequently invasive tests. To evaluate the potential diagnostic value of carpal radiography in suspected cases of AOSD, a retrospective blinded analysis of 48 patients (16 each with AOSD, juvenile chronic arthritis, and adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis) was performed. Pericapitate articular alterations without radiocarpal involvement were found to be distinctly unusual among patients with rheumatoid arthritis but frequent in the setting of AOSD. In juvenile chronic arthritis severe pericapitate involvement also occurs frequently but is more likely to be associated with interosseous fusion and severe pancompartmental disease.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The application of digital teleradiology (DTR) to radiologic examinations performed in the emergency room was evaluated. A total of 919 examinations (ten computed tomographic; the rest, radiographic) were transmitted to a radiology resident at another hospital emergency room. The 512 X 512 images were reviewed by an attending radiologist and compared with another attending radiologist's interpretation of the original films. Cases with discrepant interpretations were analyzed. Inadequate DTR image quality was responsible for clinically significant discrepancies in 14 of 897 cases (1.6%) available for follow up. Problem areas such as the detection of pneumothorax and abdominal calcifications were identified. Retransmission of optically zoomed images of areas of concern and repeat radiographs of overpenetrated films are suggested to improve DTR performance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inoperable adenocarcinoma of endometrium: radiation therapy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1960 and 1979, 41 patients with adenocarcinoma of the endometrium who were poor surgical risks were treated with radiation therapy at the University of Iowa. Local tumor control was achieved in 78% of the patients, 5% manifested complications, and 46% survived 5 years ("uncorrected" 5-year survival rate). Intercurrent disease was the major cause of death (54%), and intrauterine recurrence (22%) was the most frequent recurrence. Intraperitoneal spread (12%) occurred as commonly as hematogenous metastases (12%). Three of nine local failures occurred after 5 years. Local control rates correlated well with clinical stage, and the survival rates correlated well with the stage and grade of the tumor. Local tumor control was achieved in 95% of patients who received greater than 7,000 mg-h intracavitary radium, compared with 63% of patients treated with less than 7,000 mg-h.</ABSTRACT>

- Thirty-eight women with surgically confirmed periaortic lymph node metastases from cervical or endometrial carcinoma received radiation therapy. The 5-year observed actuarial survival and relapse-free rates were 42% and 41%, respectively. Concomitant peritoneal metastases conferred a bleak prognosis. There were no differences in survival as a function of site of origin, histologic characteristics, or bulk of periaortic metastases. Earlier stage disease tended to have a higher probability of cure. Morbidity was acceptable. The results confirmed the importance of radiation therapy in the management of lymph node metastases in uterine cancer.</ABSTRACT>

In 14 of 42 patients, one or both major fissures appeared as two parallel lines rather than as a single line. This was more common in the left lung base. Using a phantom, the authors were able to reproduce the phenomenon by simulating cardiac motion. Therefore, this motion may lead to an artifactual increase in the number of interstitial lines.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A portable signal causing faithful DNA methylation de novo in Neurospora crassa.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Methylation of cytosine residues in eukaryotic DNA is common, but poorly understood. Typically several percent of the cytosines are methylated; however, it is unclear what governs which sequences eventually become modified. Neurospora crassa DNA containing the "zeta-eta" (zeta-eta) region, which is a region of unusually heavy methylation, was tested for its ability to direct DNA methylation de novo. DNA stripped of its methylation by propagation in Escherichia coli was reintroduced into Neurospora crassa by transformation. The zeta-eta region reproducibly became "properly" methylated whether inserted at its native chromosomal position or at ectopic sites. Adjacent Neurospora and bacterial sequences in the transforming DNA rarely became methylated. A model is presented that accounts for position-independent faithful methylation as observed in the zeta-eta region, as well as position-dependent methylation, as occasionally observed, especially with sequences not native to Neurospora.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Glycolysis preferentially inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels in isolated guinea pig cardiac myocytes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In heart, glycolysis may be a preferential source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for membrane functions. In this study the patch-clamp technique was used to study potassium channels sensitive to intracellular ATP levels in permeabilized ventricular myocytes. Activation of these K+ channels has been implicated in marked cellular K+ loss leading to electrophysiological abnormalities and arrhythmias during myocardial ischemia. The results showed that glycolysis was more effective than oxidative phosphorylation in preventing ATP-sensitive K+ channels from opening. Experiments in excised inside-out patches suggested that key glycolytic enzymes located in the membrane or adjacent cytoskeleton near the channels may account for their preference for glycolytic ATP.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A glycan-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D in human serum.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A group of proteins anchored to the cell by phosphatidylinositol (PI) has recently been identified. The significance of this new class of membrane anchor is unknown; one possibility is that it facilitates release of the molecule by phospholipases. In fact, phospholipase C enzymes specific for the complex carboxyl-terminal glycolipids of these proteins have been isolated from African trypanosomes and from hepatocyte plasma membranes. This study reports the discovery of a glycan-PI-specific phospholipase D in human serum that cleaves both the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein of African trypanosomes and its glycolipid precursor, but not phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylinositol. Decay-accelerating factor, another PI-anchored molecule, is also cleaved by the enzyme and converted from a hydrophobic to a soluble protein. The enzyme is Ca2+-dependent, heat labile, and not affected by the inhibitor of serine proteases, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Its function is not known, but the present findings indicate that it participates in the metabolism of glycolipid-anchored membrane proteins.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sequence analysis on microcomputers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Overall, each of the program packages performed their tasks satisfactorily. For analyses where there was a well-defined answer, such as a search for a restriction site, there were few significant differences between the program sets. However, for tasks in which a degree of flexibility is desirable, such as homology or similarity determinations and database searches, DNASTAR consistently afforded the user more options in conducting the required analysis than did the other two packages. However, for laboratories where sequence analysis is not a major effort and the expense of a full sequence analysis workstation cannot be justified, MicroGenie and IBI-Pustell offer a satisfactory alternative. MicroGenie is a polished program system. Many may find that its user interface is more "user friendly" than the standard menu-driven interfaces. Its system of filing sequences under individual passwords facilitates use by more than one person. MicroGenie uses a hardware device for software protection that occupies a card slot in the computer on which it is used. Although I am sympathetic to the problem of software piracy, I feel that a less drastic solution is in order for a program likely to be sharing limited computer space with other software packages. The IBI-Pustell package performs the required analysis functions as accurately and quickly as MicroGenie but it lacks the clearness and ease of use. The menu system seems disjointed, and new or infrequent users often find themselves at apparent "dead-end menus" where the only clear alternative is to restart the entire program package. It is suggested from published accounts that the user interface is going to be upgraded and perhaps when that version is available, use of the system will be improved. The documentation accompanying each package was relatively clear as to how to run the programs, but all three packages assumed that the user was familiar with the computational techniques employed. MicroGenie and IBI-Pustell further complicated their documentation by mixing instructions for the version based on floppy disk operation with that for the hard disk version.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reduction to homozygosity of genes on chromosome 11 in human breast neoplasia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The somatic loss of heterozygosity for normal alleles occurring in human tumors has suggested the presence of recessive oncogenes. The results presented here demonstrate a loss of heterozygosity of several genes on chromosome 11 in primary breast tumors. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of these DNAs further suggests that the most frequent loss of sequences in breast tumors occurs between the beta-globin and parathyroid hormone loci on the short arm of chromosome 11. The loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 11 loci has a significant association with tumors that lack estrogen and progesterone receptors, grade III tumors, and distal metastasis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Clonal analysis of human colorectal tumors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clonal composition of human colorectal tumors was studied by means of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). First, X-linked RFLPs were used to examine the pattern of X chromosome inactivation in colorectal tumors of females. All 50 tumors examined showed monoclonal patterns of X chromosome inactivation; these tumors included 20 carcinomas as well as 30 adenomas of either familial or spontaneous type. Second, RFLPs of autosomes were used as clonal markers to detect the somatic loss or gain of specific chromosomal sequences in colorectal tumors. Among other changes, it was found that somatic loss of chromosome 17p sequences occurred in over 75 percent of the carcinomas examined, but such loss was rare in adenomas. These data support a monoclonal origin for colorectal neoplasms, and suggest that a gene on the short arm of chromosome 17 may be associated with progression from the benign to the malignant state.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- D-alanine in the frog skin peptide dermorphin is derived from L-alanine in the precursor.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A D-alanine-containing peptide termed dermorphin, with potent opiate-like activity, has been isolated from skin of the frog Phyllomedusa sauvagei. Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed from frog skin messenger RNA and screened with a mixture of oligonucleotides that contained the codons complementary to five amino acids of dermorphin. Clones were detected with inserts coding for different dermorphin precursors. The predicted amino acid sequences of these precursors contained homologous repeats of 35 amino acids that included one copy of the heptapeptide dermorphin. In these cloned cDNAs, the alanine codon GCG occurred at the position where D-alanine is present in the end product. This suggests the existence of a novel post-translational reaction for the conversion of an L-amino acid to its D-isomer.</ABSTRACT>

Transforming oncogenes of the ras family were capable of converting fibroblast cell lines to fully metastatic tumors. Cell lines transformed by the kinase oncogenes mos, raf, src, fes, and fms formed experimental metastases and (in some cases) these genes were more efficient at metastatic conversion than a mutant ras gene. In contrast, cells transformed by either of two nuclear oncogenes, myc or p53, were tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously but were virtually nonmetastatic after intravenous injection. These data demonstrate that, in addition to ras, a structurally divergent group of kinase oncogenes can induce the metastatic phenotype.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede: alanine insertion and abolition of plasmin inhibitory activity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin that is associated with a serious bleeding tendency has been found in a Dutch family and is referred to as alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede. This abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin is converted from an inhibitor of plasmin to a substrate. The molecular defect of alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede, as revealed by sequencing of cloned genomic DNA fragments, consists of an alanine insertion near the active site region of the molecule. Substitution of this fragment into complementary DNA for a wild-type alpha 2-antiplasmin yields a translation product with physical and functional properties typical of the abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede. The naturally occurring mutant may serve as a model for investigating the structures that determine the properties of an inhibitor versus those of a substrate in serine protease inhibitors.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Conservation of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in mice and humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A portion of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene transcript from human fetal skeletal muscle and mouse adult heart was sequenced, representing approximately 25 percent of the total, 14-kb DMD transcript. The nucleic acid and predicted amino acid sequences from the two species are nearly 90 percent homologous. The amino acid sequence that is predicted from this portion of the DMD gene indicates that the protein product might serve a structural role in muscle, but the abundance and tissue distribution of the messenger RNA suggests that the DMD protein is not nebulin.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Conduction velocity variations minimize conduction time differences among retinal ganglion cell axons.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The visual system is able to accurately represent the spatiotemporal relations among the elements of a changing visual scene as the image moves across the retinal surface. This precise spatiotemporal mapping occurs despite great variability in retinal position and conduction velocity even among retinal ganglion cells of the same physiological class-a variability that would seem to reduce the precision with which spatiotemporal information can be transmitted to central visual areas. There was a strong negative relation between the intraretinal and extraretinal conduction time for axons of individual ganglion cells of the X-cell class. The effect of this relation was to produce a nearly constant total transmission time between the soma of a retinal X cell and its central target site. Thus, the variation in the conduction velocities of retinal ganglion cell axons may ensure that, regardless of the constraints imposed by retinal topography, a precise spatiotemporal central representation of the retinal image is maintained.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Apolipoprotein B-48 is the product of a messenger RNA with an organ-specific in-frame stop codon.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The primary structure of human apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 has been deduced and shown by a combination of DNA excess hybridization, sequencing of tryptic peptides, cloned complementary DNAs, and intestinal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to be the product of an intestinal mRNA with an in-frame UAA stop codon resulting from a C to U change in the codon CAA encoding Gln2153 in apoB-100 mRNA. The carboxyl-terminal Ile2152 of apoB-48 purified from chylous ascites fluid has apparently been cleaved from the initial translation product, leaving Met2151 as the new carboxyl-terminus. These data indicate that approximately 85% of the intestinal mRNAs terminate within approximately 0.1 to 1.0 kilobase downstream from the stop codon. The other approximately 15% have lengths similar to hepatic apoB-100 mRNA even though they have the same in-frame stop codon. The organ-specific introduction of a stop codon to a mRNA appears unprecedented and might have implications for cryptic polyadenylation signal recognition and RNA processing.</ABSTRACT>

- Applied electric fields were used to promote axonal regeneration in spinal cords of adult guinea pigs. A propriospinal intersegmental reflex (the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex) was used to test lateral tract function after hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord. An electrical field (200 microvolts per millimeter, cathode rostral) applied across the lesion led to functional recovery of the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex in 25 percent of experimental animals, whereas the functional deficit remained in control animals, which were implanted with inactive stimulators.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Linkage of functional and structural heterogeneity in proteins: dynamic hole burning in carboxymyoglobin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Inhomogeneous broadening of the 760-nanometer photoproduct band of carboxymyoglobin at cryogenic temperatures has been demonstrated with a dynamic hole burning technique. Line-shape changes and frequency shifts in this spectral band are generated by ligand recombination and are shown not to be the result of structural relaxation below 60 K. The observation of dynamic hole burning exposes the relation between the structural disorder responsible for the inhomogeneous broadening and the well-known distributed ligand rebinding kinetics. The findings provide direct evidence for the functional relevance of conformational substrates in myoglobin rebinding. In addition, a general protocol for evaluating the relative contributions of structural relaxation and hole burning to the spectral changes accompanying rebinding in hemeproteins is presented.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- X-ray holograms at improved resolution: a study of zymogen granules.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- X-ray holography offers the possibility of three-dimensional microscopy with resolution higher than that of the light microscope and with contrast based on x-ray edges. In principle, the method is especially advantageous for biological samples if x-rays in the wavelength region between the carbon and oxygen K edges are used. However, until now the achieved resolution has not exceeded that of the light microscope because of the poor coherence properties of the x-ray sources and the low resolution of the detectors that were available. With a recently developed x-ray source based on an undulator on an electron storage ring, and high resolution x-ray resist, a hologram has been recorded at about 400-angstrom resolution. The experiment utilized x-rays with wavelengths of 24.7 angstroms and required a 1-hour exposure of the pancreatic zymogen granules under study.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Family study of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene in labeled platelet membranes, an index of membrane fluidity, identifies a prominent subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who manifest distinct clinical features. In a family study, the prevalence of this platelet membrane abnormality was 3.2 to 11.5 times higher in asymptomatic, first-degree relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease than in neurologically healthy control subjects chosen without regard to family history of dementia. The pattern of the platelet membrane abnormality within families was consistent with that of a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait. Thus, this abnormality of platelet membranes may be an inherited factor that is related to the development of Alzheimer's disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nuclear reassembly excludes large macromolecules.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Interphase nucleus and cytoplasm are distinct compartments, whose soluble macromolecular contents mix when the nuclear envelope disassembles at mitosis. To determine how their interphase identities are reestablished, fibroblasts were loaded with fluorescent dextrans and then allowed to divide. Large dextrans (molecular weight of 40,000 or more) were excluded from condensed mitotic chromosomes and from newly formed, postmitotic interphase nuclei. Therefore, postmitotic reassembly of the nucleus as a compartment distinct from cytoplasm occurs by exclusion not only of organelles but also of soluble macromolecules. This might occur by exclusion of macromolecules from condensed chromatin throughout mitosis and completion of nuclear envelope assembly before nuclear expansion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Troublesome aspects of the patient-physician relationship: a study of human factors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We investigated three onerous aspects of the patient-physician relationship using contemporary psychosocial research methods. A "hassle index" identified three dimensions of vexation in practice: problems with running a practice, medical conditions of patients, and social characteristics of patients. In general, hassle was found to be dependent on the type of practice, but physicians were equally annoyed by unlikeable patients irrespective of their practice site. Diagnostic errors made by resident physicians from various clinics were more related to an unlikeable medical disorder than to differences in the clinics. To clarify doctors' negative feelings toward patients, a questionnaire measuring antipathy toward specific patient types was administered to physicians. Responses indicated that physicians' antipathy was unrelated to the doctors' ethical beliefs and their medicopolitical orientation. Personality variables indicative of "extremeness" of opinion about patients included high needs for dominance, low needs for nurturance and "intraception" (the ability to analyze the behavior and motives of others), and low self-esteem. Personality profiles of physicians least vexed by medical practice reflected less psychopathology--less self-derogation, less need for emotional support, and more extroversion. Medical College Aptitude Test scores revealed that high science scores were associated with extremeness of opinion, and low scores on general information were indicative of increased susceptibility to the daily irritations of medical practice.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Selected urban and rural Alabama populations were compared by age, sex, and race on the prevalence of hypertension and uncontrolled hypertension and the percentage of treated hypertensives with controlled blood pressure. We found the following results: (1) Rural women had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension than urban women. (2) The prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was significantly higher for urban white men than for their rural counterparts. (3) The prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was significantly higher for rural black women aged 30 to 39 than for the same age group of urban black women. (4) Rural dwellers generally had much better blood pressure control than urban, though this was not manifested evenly across groups. Statistically significant differences were found for white men and women of all ages combined and in three of four age groups. Reasons for the rural-urban differences are unclear, but the rural area surveyed was served by nurse practitioner clinics that strongly emphasized patient education.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Central venous cannulation done by house officers in the intensive care unit: a prospective study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Central venous cannulation (CVC) is a procedure frequently performed by house staff in the intensive care units of teaching hospitals. In the medical ICUs of our two hospitals, CVC was successfully done by house officers in 172 cases requiring 231 attempts (one operator at one insertion site), for a success rate of 74%. There were 14 complications (6.1%), five requiring intervention, but none fatal. The overall success rate was higher for the internal jugular approach and lower for the external jugular approach than for other sites. The success rate for Swan-Ganz catheterization was higher for the internal jugular than for the subclavian approach. CVC during resuscitation was frequently unsuccessful (41%) and/or complicated (13.6%). Although success rates were comparable, complications were more common among experienced house officers than among interns, perhaps reflecting patient selection. There was a trend toward fewer and/or less severe complications during the course of the month and of the study.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Superior vena cava syndrome: experience in a teaching hospital.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1972 and 1985, 39 patients with superior vena cava syndrome were admitted to the Medical College of Georgia Hospitals. I have reviewed the hospital courses of these patients and compared clinical and laboratory findings with those reported in previous series. The syndrome was malignant in 34 patients (mean age of 50 years) and benign in five (mean age of 30 years). Duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 17 months in patients with benign disease and 18 days in those with malignant disease. Presence of symptoms for less than four weeks was associated with a high likelihood of malignancy. Invasive diagnostic procedures established a diagnosis in 33 patients, and no procedural complications occurred. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed superior vena cava obstruction and localized the level of obstruction in all six patients in whom it was done. Information gained from venacavograms did not alter therapeutic decisions. In eight patients, establishment of a definitive histologic diagnosis altered the treatment. Treatment relieved the symptoms in 69% of the patients with malignant superior vena cava syndrome, and no patient had recurrent symptoms after therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We reviewed the causes of death in 50 patients treated for systemic lupus erythematosus at the University of Mississippi Medical Center between 1973 and 1985. Two groups of patients could be distinguished based on the age at onset but not on the duration of disease. Younger patients more often died of active renal disease an infectious complications, while older patients died of other organ involvement, inactive renal disease, and miscellaneous causes. Common causes of infection were gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was an infrequent cause of death, and no patients died of malignancy. Patients who died had more multisystemic involvement, with serositis and renal, central nervous system, and hematologic manifestations than patients who were alive at last follow-up.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We treated 31 cases of localized central nervous system infection over a seven-year period in our community hospital. The causes included brain abscess in 18 cases (58%); cranial subdural empyema (CSE) in six cases (20%); spinal epidural abscess (SEA) in four cases (13%); cranial epidural abscess (CEA) in two cases (6%); and spinal subdural empyema (SSE) in one case (3%). Both CSE and CEA were often caused by sinusitis and manifested by fever, headache, altered sensorium, and focal neurologic signs. Treatment consisted of drainage by burr holes or craniotomy followed by long-term administration of parenteral antibiotics. Though all patients with CSE and CEA survived, half had severe residual neurologic deficits. Both SEA and SSE were manifested by fever, spinal pain, and loss of motor function, and both were treated by laminectomy drainage and antibiotic administration. One patient died and three of the other four had residual neurologic deficits or back pain. Diagnosis of CSE and CEA was facilitated by CT scanning, while clinical examination, CT scanning, and myelography were useful in diagnosing SEA; SSE was not suspected preoperatively.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Radiation-induced bowel disease manifested by debilitating diarrhea is an unfortunate consequence of therapeutic irradiation for pelvic malignancies. Although the mechanism for this diarrhea is not well understood, many believe it is the result of damage to small bowel mucosa and subsequent bile acid malabsorption. Excess amounts of bile acids, especially the dihydroxy components, are known to induce water and electrolyte secretion and increase bowel motility. We have directly measured individual and total bile acids in the stool samples of 11 patients with radiation-induced diarrhea and have found bile acids elevated two to six times normal in eight of them. Our patients with diarrhea and increased bile acids in their stools had prompt improvement when given cholestyramine. They had fewer stools and returned to a more normal life-style.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Continent intestinal reservoir.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In this series, 170 patients have received a continent intestinal reservoir, with follow-up of one to eight years. In 126 a conventional ileostomy was converted to a continent intestinal reservoir, 38 at the time of coloproctectomy. Six had an unsatisfactory ileoanal or ileorectal anastomosis initially, and 26 (15%) required revisional surgery for problems involving the reservoir or valve. The incidence of valve slippage was 3%. Eighty-five percent achieved a normally functioning small bowel reservoir with one operation, and 19 more patients were added with one additional operation, for an ultimate good result of 96% with two operations at most. The average reservoir capacity is 400 ml, and most patients empty the pouch two or three times per day. Under favorable circumstances, the continent intestinal reservoir is preferable for most patients after coloproctectomy.</ABSTRACT>

The diagnosis was established by a deficiency of NBT dye reduction by neutrophils, in addition to impairment in 14C-1-glucose utilization, 125I-iodination of zymosan, chemiluminescence, superoxide radical generation, and bactericidal activity toward S aureus. This adult patient exhibits many characteristics of chronic granulomatous disease of childhood but of less severity, which may explain his unusually long survival. It is thus important to consider the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease not only in children but also in adult patients having the characteristic pattern of recurrent infections.</ABSTRACT>

After surgical revascularization, biopsy of the superior mesenteric artery showed FMD. We interviewed and examined all close consanguineous relatives and found abdominal bruits in the patient's younger sister and mother. Arteriograms showed total occlusion of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries in the sister, and a subtotal celiac occlusion in the mother. Postprandial abdominal pain and constipation in the sister prompted elective mesenteric revascularization, and biopsy of the superior mesenteric artery confirmed FMD identical to that of her older sister. The mother, who is asymptomatic, has single vessel disease and has not required operative intervention. Our report strongly supports the hypothesis of a genetic basis for this arteriopathy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Some upper cervical spine norms.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Lateral cervical spine films from 175 normal examinations of adults performed in the emergency room of North Carolina Baptist Hospital were analyzed to establish some norms and relationships in the upper cervical spine. The predens angle was found to be between 0 degree-13 degrees (mean 5.57 degrees) in neutral position and 0-18 degrees (mean 9.27 degrees) in flexion in most persons. Ninety-two percent of persons have angles greater than 3 degrees in flexion. A V-shaped predens space is not indicative of injury to the cruciate ligament. Virtually every person has posterior slanting or tilting of the dens and the range of values is up to 35 degrees (mean 17.43 degrees). Ninety-eight percent of persons have an angle greater than 6 degrees. A tilted dens does not indicate acute or remote trauma. No relationship was identified between the predens angle and the dens tilt angle. The posterior arch of the atlas can be found at any position between the occiput and spinous process of C2 in all positions of the head and neck. Hence, fanning or widening of the C1-C2 interspinous distance is not a reliable index of ligamentous injury in the upper cervical spine.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Stability of three types of double scoliotic curves of 10-40 degrees was analyzed using a biomechanical model: double primary (Type I), primary thoracic with compensatory lumbar (Type II), and primary lumbar with compensatory thoracic (Type III). The load-carrying capacity of each curve was analyzed as a function of magnitude of the curve, its location and flexibility. Curve magnitude was found to be the most influential parameter governing the stability of a scoliotic curve up to 30 degrees. Results suggest that in evaluating curves of comparable magnitudes, Type I and II curves are more likely to progress and, therefore, should be braced at an earlier stage than Type III curves.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Osteophytes of the spine compressing the sympathetic trunk and splanchnic nerves in the thorax.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The presence of osteophytes compressing the sympathetic structures in the thorax was found in 655 (65.5%) of 1,000 cadavers. In 60.4% of the affected cases, the compression was on the right side, and in 36.9% it was bilateral, although the right side was more severely affected. In 2%, the compression was on the left only. The highest frequency of compression was at the T8-10 level, the right greater splanchnic nerve being the structure most frequently involved. The sympathetic trunk itself (ganglia and cord) was affected only by osteophytes of vertebrae at the lowest thoracic levels; however, bony excrescences due to costovertebral joint arthritis were frequently found impinging on the sympathetic trunk and its rami communicantes at similar frequencies on both sides. The factors governing the characteristic compression of the sympathetic structures in the thorax are the typical development of the osteophytes and the special relations of the sympathetic structures to the vertebral column at the various levels. It is proposed that these observations are useful in understanding certain observed clinical conditions and act an anatomic baseline for research in the future.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Detection of sacral sparing in acute spinal cord injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sacral dermatomal-evoked responses (DEP) and posterior tibial nerve (PTN) somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) were recorded 28 hours after gunshot injury to the 12th thoracic vertebra of a 17-year-old male. Repeatable responses were obtained from stimulation of the fourth sacral dermatome despite absence of repeatable PTN responses. This suggestion of "sacral sparing" was accompanied by clinical improvement of neural function during the hospital course and 10 months after discharge. This case suggests DEP can make valuable contributions in the diagnosis of sacral sparing in acute spinal cord injury. Considerations regarding the unusual ipsilateral scalp recording location for sacral DEP are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

- A case of an anterior spinal artery syndrome complicating an anterior spinal fusion is reported. Besides documenting a relatively rare complication of anterior spinal surgery, the level of the lesion (T6) and the association of spinal shock are relatively unusual. Intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) deteriorated only transiently and failed to reflect adequately the neurologic injury either intraoperatively or postoperatively. The shortcomings of SEP monitoring are discussed, and the recommendation is made to use the combination of SEPs with the wake-up test when possible.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A case is reported of an isolated posterior column injury secondary to direct mechanical trauma complicating a posterior spinal fusion. This case documents a rare complication of posterior spinal surgery. Intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP) monitoring documented the injury whereas two intraoperative wake-up tests did not. This case demonstrates the value of intraoperative spinal cord monitoring in general. It also demonstrates the value of combining means to assess both anterior and posterior cord separately, intraoperatively. It is recommended that the wake-up test be used in conjunction with SEPs intraoperatively.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Stabilization of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with the internal spinal skeletal fixation system. Indications, techniques, and first results of treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Since 1984, 30 patients with burst fractures of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine were treated with AO internal spinal skeletal fixation system. All patients in this series had a minimum follow-up of 12 months. This new instrumentation is a posterior intrapedicular system developed by Dick in 1982. It allows stable fixation that is limited only to adjacent spinal segments. The internal fixator permits reduction in all three planes. Independently, it is possible to add distraction or compression to the involved segments. It also is able to reduce effectively the "middle column" which is thought to be accomplished by "ligamentotaxis." In this series there were 16 neurologically intact patients and 14 with partial or complete neurologic injury. There were two minor instrumentation loosenings early in the series. Most patients in this series had a near-anatomic reduction of all three columns in the involved segment. It was also possible to re-establish the normal lordosis of the lumbar spine. The device provided sufficient rigid fixation for rapid postoperative mobilization in a light external orthosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Correlation of objective measure of trunk motion and muscle function with low-back disability ratings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A study was undertaken to examine relations among some objective and subjective measures of low-back-related disability in a group of 41 low-back pain patients and in seven pain-free control subjects. Subjective measures of disability were obtained by Oswestry patient questionnaires. Oswestry disability score related significantly (P less than 0.001) to presence or absence of relaxation in back muscles during flexion. Mean trunk strength ratios were inversely related to disability score (P less than .05), and trunk mobility was meaningfully reduced (P less than .01). Despite loss of motion, a large enough excursion was observed to predict presence of back muscle relaxation. These findings imply that myoelectric signal levels, trunk strength ratios, and ranges of trunk motion may be used as objective indicators of low-back pain disability.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Body height changes from vibration.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A device for measuring body height is reported (SD, 1 mm). The change in body height before and after vibration and quiet sitting respectively was studied in eight men aged 22-44 years who were free of back pain. The vibration frequency was set at 5 Hz and the acceleration at 2 msec-2. Subjects were asked to report for testing within 2 hours after arising from bed. Body height was measured before and immediately after vibration or sitting exposure and the measurements were repeated at different intervals up to 2 hours after the experiment. Results show that exposure to vibration increases the overall creep response in most subjects. There is a great deal of variability in response between subjects, but most of them show a recovery to the average creep response within a 2-hour time interval.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Biomechanical comparison of seven internal fixation devices for the lumbosacral junction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- For comparison purposes, seven different internal fixation systems were applied sequentially to each of six fresh-frozen cadaver spines at the lumbosacral junction. The spines were loaded to a maximum flexion bending moment of 12 Newton meters and an extension moment of 6 Nm. Resultant angular motion was recorded with an electrogoniometer. The Synthes and Kaneda devices provided the most rigid fixation in flexion and extension testing. The Luque internal fixation system was as effective as the Kaneda and Synthes systems at limiting extension but was slightly less successful at limiting flexion. The Knodt system was effective at limiting extension but less effective in limiting flexion. The interfacet screws were effective at limiting flexion but less effective at limiting extension. Harrington rods to the sacral alae were the least effective system in both directions. Sublaminar wires did little to improve their performance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metrizamide myelography in patients with iodine allergy or previous adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty-seven metrizamide myelographies were performed in 26 patients who had a history of iodine allergy or adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media. Three of the patients had had adverse reactions from a previous myelography procedure. All patients received atropine, diazepam, and metoclopramide as premedication. In ten examinations corticosteroids were also given. No patient, during or after myelography, had any reaction that could be related to hypersensitivity to the contrast medium. The incidence of headache, the most frequent side effect, was almost the same in patients who had corticosteroids in their premedication (30%) as in patients without (35%). These observations indicate that metrizamide myelography may be performed despite previous adverse reactions to contrast media.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Foraminal and extraforaminal lumbar disc herniation: diagnosis and treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During a 1-year period from December 1, 1984, through November 30, 1985, a total of 174 patients underwent lumbar discectomy for herniated nucleus pulposus. Eighteen (10.3%) were diagnosed as having foraminal or extraforaminal disc herniations. Sixteen patients are included in this study. All patients were evaluated with computed tomography, metrizamide myelography, discography, and discography-enhanced computed tomography (disco-CT). Accurate diagnosis of foraminal or extraforaminal herniation was made with disco-CT in 15 of 16 cases (93.8%), compared with discography alone (37.5%), computed tomography alone, and/or myelography-enhanced computed tomography (50%) and myelography alone (12.5%). Surgical treatment with bilateral hemilaminectomy, partial medial facetectomy, and partial internal foraminotomy, if needed, followed by discectomy is very effective and the favored surgical management for nerve root decompression in most all cases.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Possible role of oxygen-derived, free radicals in cardiocirculatory shock.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The release of oxygen free radicals from ischemic myocardial tissue has been implicated as a causative factor of cell membrane damage and cardiac dysfunction in hemorrhagic shock. This study was done to determine whether or not hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide ion (O2) are responsible for cardiac injury from hemorrhagic shock as indicated by reduced coronary perfusion and impaired contractile function. This hypothesis was tested by infusing selective O2 and H2O2 scavengers into anesthetized dogs in a state of shock, either during shock (group 3) or with fluid resuscitation (group 2) and comparing the cardiovascular response to that seen with shock and fluid resuscitation alone (group 1). We found no significant difference in shock induced derangements in myocardial oxygen metabolism or the degree of myocardial depression and regional ischemia in dogs in a state of shock given superoxide dismutase plus catalase, compared with shock alone. The results of our data suggested that, if O2 and H2O2 play a causative role in shock induced cardiac dysfunction or during reperfusion after shock, free radical scavengers must be administered early in the ischemic period. Furthermore, free radical scavengers administered with reperfusion do not enchance cardiac function nor myocardial perfusion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Update on clinical experience with different surgical techniques of the endorectal pull-through operation for colitis and polyposis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During the past ten years, 145 patients (130 with ulcerative colitis and 15 with polyposis) have undergone colectomy and endorectal ileal pull-through operations at the UCLA Medical Center. The mean age of the patients at operation was 22.4 years (a range of seven to 56 years). All of the patients had a two stage operation with temporary ileostomy. Five had an S-shaped reservoir (SR), one patient had a J-shaped reservoir (JR), 12 patients had no reservoir (NR), 97 had a lateral reservoir with the reservoir constructed at the second operation (LR-2) and 30 had a lateral reservoir constructed at the first operation (LR-1). The most common complications were reservoir inflammation, obstruction of the reservoir outlet, stricture of the ileoanal anastomosis, superficial wound infection and sinus tracts extending upward between the rectal muscle cuff and the pull-through segment of ileum. Forty-four patients underwent reoperation for one or more of the complications. Reoperation was performed upon 60 per cent of the patients with SR, 36 per cent with LR-2, 10 per cent with LR-1 and 17 per cent with NR. Of the reoperations, 33 were performed upon the first 50 patients. Only 11 of the last 95 patients required a corrective operation. Of the last 95 patients, 97.5 per cent are currently functioning well. Important features of the operative technique include using a short rectal muscle cuff (5 centimeters or less), constructing a short reservoir (less than 15 centimeters) and having a short reservoir spout (less than 2 centimeters). Although a reservoir reduces fecal urgency and frequency in most instances, patients with obesity, anorectal muscle spasm, severe rectal disease and thick mesentery may be best treated with no reservoir. In our experience, the LR-1 procedure is technically easy to construct, has a low incidence of complications and is the preferred technique.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Preservation of the parathyroid glands in total thyroidectomy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A series of 183 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy is presented. The operative method, which emphasizes visualization and preservation of the parathyroid glands and their blood supply, as well as exposure of the recurrent laryngeal nerves, is discussed in detail. Permanent hypoparathyroidism was a complication in six patients (3.3 per cent). Permanent nerve injury occurred in one patient (0.55 per cent). Postoperatively, 78 patients had radioactive iodine uptake studies to evaluate the amount of residual thyroid tissue in the neck. Sixty-four (82 per cent) had 24 hour uptake studies of less than 2 per cent and 52 had an uptake of less than 1 per cent. Although a careful and consistent technique of total thyroidectomy substantially reduces the danger of permanent hypocalcemia, we experienced this complication sporadically. Since no operative technique completely removes the danger of permanent hypoparathyroidism, it is our opinion that total thyroidectomy should not be the standard management for carcinoma of the thyroid gland. It is best reserved for those patients in whom the extent of disease or the aggressiveness of the histologic cell type warrants the increased risk.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of nosocomial infections due to Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci in a general hospital.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Hospital acquired infections caused by enterococci are increasing in incidence. This increase has been attributed, in part, to widespread use of cephalosporin antibiotics which lack activity against enterococci. To test this hypothesis, we compared patients having nosocomial enterococcal pulmonary and wound infections with those patients having nosocomial staphylococcal infections for antecedant cephalosporin use. In a six month period, we found 14 instances of nosocomial enterococcal wound and respiratory infections; 13 were superinfections (occurring during or up to one week after administration of antimicrobials). Seven had coexisting pathogens noted. In the same six month period, 30 instances of Staphylococcus aureus nosocomial respiratory tract and wound infections were found and only 13 were superinfections (p less than 0.002 compared with enterococcal superinfections). Nine had coexisting pathogens noted. The mean age, gender distribution and underlying illnesses in the Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcal superinfection groups were comparable. Of the 14 instances of enterococcal nosocomial infections, 11 were associated with administration of a cephalosporin compared with seven of 30 for staphylococcal infections (p less than 0.002). Nosocomial enterococcal infections are commonly associated with antimicrobial therapy and the use of cephalosporins may selectively predispose patients to increased risk of enterococcal superinfections.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, and morphometric studies of human prolactinomas after short-term bromocriptine treatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two cases of human prolactinomas after short-term treatment with bromocriptine were studied by means of immunohistochemistry for prolactin, electron microscopy, and morphometry at the ultrastructural level. The results obtained showed an abundance of immunoreactive secretory granules in the tumor cells, a paucity in the electron microscopic images suggesting exocytosis of secretory granules, and no significant changes in the volume density of rough endoplasmic reticulum when compared with untreated (control) tumor cells. These findings strongly suggest that the effects of short-term bromocriptine treatment for lowering serum prolactin levels did not inhibit protein and secretory granule synthesis but rather caused a disturbance in the secretion of prolactin granules. The present morphometrical data suggest the possibility that a reduction in the number of cytoplasmic microtubules might be related to the disturbance of prolactin secretion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Thoracic aortic occlusion: somatosensory evoked potential monitoring and neurologic outcome in a canine model.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored in 17 canines during spinal cord ischemia induced by balloon occlusion of the thoracic aorta. Graded distal aortic hypotension to 40 mmHg in seven animals had no significant effect upon the evoked potential. A significant alteration in the SEP did result in 21 +/- 9.8 minutes when distal aortic pressures were reduced in a graded fashion below 30 mmHg. Acute occlusion of the thoracic aorta (10 animals, distal pressure 15-25 mmHg) was associated with a change in the SEP in 8.4 +/- 4.3 minutes. Continuation of aortic occlusion for 30 minutes beyond an evoked potential change resulted in a moderate to severe motor deficit in all cases. Somatosensory evoked potentials obtained 72-96 hours after the ischemic injury were closely correlated with sensory deficits, but were not predictive of motor examination. Histologic examination of the spinal cords demonstrated central gray necrosis of the lumbar region in all animals with a severe deficit, and a variable degree of neuronal loss in the intermediate and dorsal gray matter zones in animals with moderate deficits. This balloon occlusion method is relevant as a model of spinal cord injury during aortic occlusion, such as may occur during aortic surgery.</ABSTRACT>

Two pituitary enlargements owing to primary hypothyroidism and one to primary hypogonadism were shown to be regressed on computed tomography after the replacement therapy. Clinically and pathologically, the differentiation of a pituitary hyperplasia from a pituitary adenoma is often very difficult. Moreover, the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Adequate medication can diminish a pituitary enlargement because of the feedback mechanism.

<ABSTRACT>
- This report analyzes experience with a modified four-limb W-shaped ileal pouch that has a larger initial capacity than do J- or S-shaped pouch designs. Fifteen patients (median age: 35 years) underwent W pouch reconstruction after proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Follow-up on each patient averaged 14 months (range: 6 to 24 months). All procedures were performed without death and with minimal morbidity. Assessment of functional results showed 24-hour stool frequency (mean +/- SEM) decreasing from 6.0 +/- 0.39 initially to 4.8 +/- 0.43 at 1 year (p less than 0.005). Night evacuation decreased from 1.1 +/- 0.2 at 1 month after surgery to 0.25 +/- 0.12 at 1 year (p less than 0.025), with 10 of 15 patients having no nocturnal pouch evacuation. Continence was excellent in all patients with the exception of three of 15 patients who had occasional minimal nighttime seepage. Pouch volume determined at surgery by saline solution infusion was 200 +/- 21 ml. Pouch volume and compliance (pressure/volume) were measured before ileostomy closure and at 6 months after surgery via a special pressure-monitored balloon catheter. Maximal pouch volume increased from 190 +/- 21 ml (at time of ileostomy takedown) to 470 +/- 85 ml at 6 months. Ileal reservoir construction with a W pouch design resulted in a low 24-hour and nighttime stool frequency and excellent compliance and evacuation characteristics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Colon interposition for benign esophageal disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We reviewed 53 consecutive patients with benign disease who underwent esophageal resection followed by colon interposition to assess operative morbidity and long-term results. Indications were gastroesophageal reflux in 32 patients, advanced motility disorders in eight, esophageal perforation in six, and strictures not related to reflux in seven. There were two operative deaths (3.8%). Fourteen other patients (26.4%) had 18 major complications including three graft infarcts, two graft perforations, and four anastomotic leaks, one of which required surgical treatment. Follow-up was complete in 83% of patients and averaged 5 years. Eight patients required dilations; and 15 underwent late reoperations for stricture, persistent symptoms, or anastomotic leak. Of the 20 patients who did not have pyloroplasty done at the initial resection, five (25%) required a subsequent gastric emptying procedure. Results were rated by patients (subjectively) and physicians (objectively, based on symptoms and the need for further therapy) as 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = fair, and 4 = poor. The patients' ratings averaged 1.89, with 27 patients (75%) claiming good or excellent results despite symptoms of postprandial fullness in 78% and dysphagia in 42%. Objective ratings averaged 2.05, with 28 of 39 patients (72%) rating the results as excellent or good. Despite a 30% major complication rate and a 37% late reoperative rate, colon interposition for benign esophageal disease can be accomplished with low mortality and high patient acceptance and remains our preferred technique for reconstruction of benign esophageal disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Specificity and sensitivity of objective diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To evaluate the diagnostic value of different tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease, a test population was constructed from 45 patients with symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation with or without esophagitis and 45 healthy subjects, who never experienced heartburn, regurgitation, or swallowing discomfort. The test population underwent esophagoscopy, standard acid reflux test, 24-hour pH monitoring, and manometry of the lower esophageal sphincter. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the accuracy of the tests and test combinations were calculated. Esophagoscopy had a sensitivity of 62%, that is, only 62% of patients with the disease have evidence of mucosal damage on endoscopy. Manometric measurements of the lower esophageal sphincter had a sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 89%, and an accuracy of 87%. Twenty-four hour esophageal pH monitoring had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96%. The results show that 24-hour pH monitoring can detect gastroesophageal reflux disease with an accuracy of 96% by measuring an increase in esophageal acid exposure. Manometry of the lower esophageal sphincter can detect a mechanically deficient sphincter as a cause of the disease with an accuracy of 87%. The test combination of 24-hour monitoring and motility studies can select patients with an accuracy of 91% who have an increase in esophageal exposure to gastric juice because of a deficient cardia. Antireflux surgery is designed to reduce esophageal exposure to gastric juice in patients with a deficient sphincter by creating a mechanical antireflux mechanism at the cardia. Therefore it is necessary to determine the mechanical status of the sphincter with manometry before surgery in such patients. Thus the indications for antireflux surgery are (1) uncontrolled symptoms of increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice; (2) a documented increase in esophageal exposure to gastric juice by 24-hour pH monitoring; and (3) a mechanically defective sphincter on motility with a pressure of 6 mm Hg or less, an overall length of 2 cm or less, and an abdominal length of 1 cm or less.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Diagnosis and treatment of genitofemoral and ilioinguinal entrapment neuralgia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During the past 7 years 30 patients were diagnosed as having either ilioinguinal or genitofemoral entrapment neuralgia. A multidisciplinary approach (surgeon, neurologist, and anesthesiologist), as well as local blocks of the ilioinguinal nerve and/or paravertebral blocks of L-1 and L-2 (genitofemoral nerve), were essential to determine accurately which nerve was specifically involved. Fifteen of the 17 patients (88%) diagnosed as having ilioinguinal neuralgia after previous inguinal herniorrhaphy are pain free after resection of the entrapped portion of the nerve. Thirteen patients were diagnosed as having genitofemoral neuralgia after previous inguinal herniorrhaphy, blunt abdominal trauma, or other surgery. Neurectomy of the genitofemoral nerve proximal to the entrapment controlled the persistent pain in 10 of 13 (77%) of these patients. Ilioinguinal or genitofemoral nerve entrapment neuralgias are rare complications of surgery in the inguinal region. When accurately diagnosed, neurectomy of the specific nerve is highly successful in relieving severe pain and paresthesia without significant morbidity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The physiology of postvagotomy duodenal ulcer healing: a prostaglandin connection.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study evaluated the type and mode of action exerted by truncal vagotomy on mucosal prostaglandin content in the rat. Ninety-six rats were equally divided into sham-operated, vagotomy, atropine-treated, and cimetidine-treated groups. Each group was subdivided into stressed (cold-restraint) and nonstressed cells. Gastric mucosal injury was graded, and duodenal mucosa was processed for determination of prostaglandin content. Results included: (1) significant increases in duodenal mucosal prostaglandins in all experimental groups compared with sham-operated controls, (2) decreases in duodenal mucosal prostaglandin content associated with stress in all groups, and (3) significantly less gastric mucosal injury in all stressed, experimentally treated rats compared with sham-operated animals. These results demonstrate that attenuation of gastric acid-secretion, achieved either surgically or pharmacologically and proved by decrease in stress gastric injury, is associated with an increase in the content of duodenal mucosal prostaglandins. Such augmentation of mucosal prostaglandins could account for, along with the direct acid-lowering effect of vagotomy, the success of truncal vagotomy in the surgical cure of duodenal ulcer disease.</ABSTRACT>

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in seven patients before and after portosystemic shunting to evaluate venous changes accompanying nonselective and selective shunt construction. The size and number of the intrahepatic portal and hepatic veins, left perirenal veins, and left upper quadrant varices were evaluated at MRI before and after shunt construction. MRI correctly diagnosed patent shunts in all seven patients. A marked decrease in the size of intrahepatic veins after a total or nonselective shunt suggests adequate portal vein and variceal decompression. Dilatation of left perirenal veins in the presence of a patent mesorenal or splenorenal shunt suggests hypertension of the left renal vein and possibly inadequate decompression of esophageal varices.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gastrojejunostomy: is it helpful for patients with pancreatic cancer?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective review of palliative outcome of gastrojejunostomy in patients with pancreatic cancer was conducted. Eighty-one patients were analyzed in two groups depending on duodenal patency. Forty-five patients (group I) had no evidence of duodenal obstruction. Thirty-six patients (group II) had evidence of impingement on the duodenum by the pancreatic cancer. A third subset of patients was also studied for outcome. These 21 patients (five group I and 16 group II) had nausea and vomiting as major symptoms and were judged to have the most to gain from gastrojejunostomy. Patients were categorized by outcome. Poor outcome was defined as either death during the hospitalization for gastrojejunostomy or death within 30 days of operation even if the patient left the hospital. Risk for poor outcome depended on group. In group I, 18 of 45 patients (40%) had a poor outcome compared with 25 of 36 (70%) patients in group II (p less than 0.001). Nineteen of the 21 (90%) patients with nausea and vomiting had a poor outcome. It is an unfortunate paradox that the more patients need gastrojejunostomy for pancreatic cancer, the less likely they are to have a favorable outcome. Gastric outlet obstruction in pancreatic cancer appears to be a terminal event. A prospective study is needed to see if any true palliation of vomiting can be affected in these patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Caval tumor thrombus complicating renal cell carcinoma: a surgical challenge.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The surgical challenge of resection of renal cell carcinoma with vena caval invasion may require close cooperation between the urologist and cardiovascular surgeon. From 1977 to 1986, 13 patients with renal cell carcinoma and tumor thrombus invading the inferior vena cava (IVC) underwent radical surgical resection. In three of 13 patients the thrombus extended into the heart (right atrium two patients and right ventricle one patient). The tumor originated in the right kidney in 10 patients and in the left kidney in three patients. There were 10 men and three women with a mean age of 64 years (range, 46 to 75 years). Surgical management included midline incision, seven, with median sternotomy, four, and thoracoabdominal, two. After exposure of the renal vessels and IVC, all patients underwent radical nephrectomy. Two patients had caval sleeve resection, one had a partial caval resection, and seven had a 1 cm caval cuff. Planned cardiopulmonary bypass was used in three patients. The tumor thrombus was extracted by simultaneous atrial and caval approaches. One patient underwent unplanned emergency cardiopulmonary bypass after intraoperative cardiac arrest caused by a large tumor embolus of the pulmonary artery. No operative deaths occurred. Postoperative morbidity was significant in five of 13 patients, caval thrombosis in one, lower limb swelling in two, renal failure in one, and pulmonary edema in one patient. Two patients required long-term anticoagulation therapy for confirmed pulmonary emboli within 1 month of surgery. These complications resolved. The follow-up period ranged from 7 to 64 months with a mean of 36 months. Two patients died of metastatic disease at 24 and 48 months after surgery. Three patients are alive with metastatic disease at 6 to 64 months while one patient had a solitary metastatic lesion removed from the frontal lobe 4 years after nephrectomy and has been disease free a subsequent 18 months. Eight of 11 patients are disease free at 7 to 64 months (four patients greater than 52 months). Our 83% survival rate at a mean follow-up of 36 months suggests that this group of patients should not be denied aggressive resection. Documentation of tumor source and caval extension are essential to plan operative procedures, including use of cardiopulmonary bypass.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prognostic significance of nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy patterns in resected hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy studies of paraffin-embedded archival tumor specimen blocks were performed by flow cytometry on extracted nuclei from 101 surgically resected hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In 28 patients, the corresponding primary carcinoma of the metastases was also studied. Tumor clinicopathology and clinical course of the patients were reviewed. Preparation of paraffin-embedded tissue specimens was performed by the technique of Hedley et al. and stained with propidium iodide according to the method of Vindelov et al. Eighty-eight of 101 metastatic tumors and 26 of 28 primary tumors yielded evaluable DNA histograms. Twenty-six metastases showed a DNA diploid pattern, 25 showed a significantly increased 4C peak (DNA tetraploid/polyploid), and 37 had a DNA aneuploid peak. Ploidy pattern was constant between primary and metastases in 84.6% of tumors. No significant relationship between host and tumor characteristics and ploidy pattern was found except for a correlation between grade 3 metastases and DNA aneuploid. Survival of patients with DNA aneuploid metastases was significantly less than that of patients with DNA diploid metastases (p = 0.03). However, among DNA nondiploid metastases, survival was significantly less for low DNA index metastases (less than or equal to 1.5) than for high DNA index (greater than 1.5) metastases (p less than 0.05). Flow cytometric DNA ploidy measurements may have prognostic value for patients with resected hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Exenterative surgery for locally advanced rectosigmoid cancers. Is it worthwhile? [published erratum appears in Surgery 1988 Mar;103(3):388]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Among 1480 patients treated for cancers of the rectosigmoid over a 30-year period, 24 patients underwent total pelvic exenteration. These patients, 13 men and 11 women, had a median age of 64 years. Pathologic staging revealed 15 Dukes' B and nine Dukes' C lesions. For 17 patients, this operation was the only form of therapy. The operative mortality rate was 20.8%; however, the mortality rate has decreased to 13.3% during the past 20 years and to 9% in the past decade. Five complications occurred in the group surviving the procedure, resulting in a 26.3% morbidity rate. Three of the five complications occurred in patients who had previous radiation therapy or surgery. The overall 5-year survival rate was 41.6%. Those patients surviving the operation had 5- and 10-year survival rates of 52.6% and 31.5%, respectively. There were seven patients in whom the disease recurred at an average of 20.3 months after exenteration, and all died an average of 8 months later. The recurrence rate for patients with Dukes' B lesions was 27% compared with 57% for patients with Dukes' C lesions. The remaining 12 disease-free patients had a mean survival of 11 years. At present, four patients are alive and well 6 to 30 years after exenteration. The best predictor of morbidity was treatment before exenteration (p less than .005). Age older than 65 years and the presence of nodal metastases may contribute to increased mortality rates and recurrence, respectively, but these relationships were not statistically significant for the group. Total pelvic exenteration is advocated for selected primary, locally advanced, rectosigmoid lesions in good-risk patients; it can be achieved now with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates and a survival rate in excess of 40% at 5 years.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Use and prognostic value of staging mediastinoscopy in non-small-cell lung cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred sixty patients had preoperative mediastinoscopy, resection of the primary tumor, and complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy for non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung. Minimum follow-up was 24 months (mean 40 months). Postoperative staging based on histologic examination of the specimen of the lung and mediastinal lymphadenectomy categorized 59 patients in stage I, 28 in stage II, and 73 in stage III (20 T3N0, 12 T3N1, 29 T1 or T2N2, and 12 T3N2). The sensitivity rate of cervical mediastinoscopy for detection of mediastinal node metastasis was 48.7%. False-negative results of mediastinoscopy occurred in 21 of 41 patients with normal mediastinoscopy: unreachable nodes in eight patients, sampling error of reachable nodes in 11 patients, and error on frozen section in two patients. Eleven of 65 patients with clinical stage I disease and normal mediastinum on chest roentgenogram had mediastinal node involvement; only three were detected by mediastinoscopy, which resulted in a low sensitivity rate (27.3%) and a high rate of unnecessary mediastinoscopy (62/65 patients). The sensitivity of mediastinoscopy increased as the amount of disease present, as measured by the clinical stage of disease or positive gallium 67 scan of mediastinum, increased. Eleven of 29 patients with T1 to T2N2 disease discovered at mediastinoscopy had similar survival rates compared with 18 of 29 patients who had a normal mediastinoscopy examination and mediastinal node involvement discovered at thoracotomy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cardiopulmonary complications after major surgery: a role for epidural analgesia?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Improvement in postoperative pulmonary mechanics with epidural analgesia has been described. Data on the hemodynamic effects of this technique are absent from the surgical literature. To provide such data we have evaluated two groups of patients undergoing aortic reconstruction: group I (n = 25), general anesthesia and group II (n = 6), general anesthesia with adjunctive epidural analgesia. The groups were comparable preoperatively as judged by the incidence of cardiac history, preoperative ejection fraction, and measured hemodynamic parameters. Postoperatively there were no significant differences in the pressure-related parameters; however, rate-related factors including heart rate and double product were significantly decreased in group II with no reduction in cardiac index. Postoperative increases in total body oxygen consumption were also markedly attenuated by epidural analgesia. Epidural analgesia reduces the hemodynamic demands on the heart after major surgery and is a useful adjunct, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Meconium ileus: a fifteen-year experience with forty-two neonates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- From 1969 to 1984, 42 neonates were managed for meconium ileus caused by cystic fibrosis. Simple, uncomplicated meconium ileus occurred in 24 infants (57%) and complicated meconium ileus occurred in 18 (43%). Meglumine diatrizoate (Gastrografin) enema completely relieved the obstruction in 13 patients with simple meconium ileus (54%) and caused colonic and rectal perforations in three (13%). Six operative procedures were used in 29 patients: double enterostomy (seven), resection with primary anastomosis (seven), Bishop-Koop enterostomy (seven), intraluminal lavage (four), colostomy (three), and Mikulicz enterostomy (one). Postoperative complications included malabsorptive diarrhea (nine), pneumonia (three), intestinal obstruction (two), total parenteral nutrition-catheter sepsis (two), and anastomotic leak (one). Infants managed nonoperatively by Gastrografin enema had a significantly shorter hospitalization (average, 15 days) than those undergoing operation for simple meconium ileus (54 days) and complicated meconium ileus (111 days). Postoperative survival rate was 100% with a late survival rate of 86%.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intussusception: current management in infants and children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Intussusception remains a leading cause of bowel obstruction in early infancy and childhood. From 1970 to 1985, 83 patients with intussusception were treated. There were 51 boys and 32 girls ranging in age from 2 months to 22 years. Ten patients had a total of 14 separate recurrences; nine occurred during the initial hospitalization. Symptoms on presentation included abdominal pain (80%), palpable mass (60%), rectal bleeding (53%), and lethargy or sepsis (45%). Fifteen children underwent exploration without contrast studies based on duration of symptoms (greater than 5 days) and evidence of severe obstruction on plain abdominal x-ray films. In the remaining children, diagnosis was confirmed by barium enema and hydrostatic reduction was achieved in only 34 patients (42% success rate). Symptoms were present more than 48 hours in 55% of the reduction failures. At operation, five children had spontaneously reduced and an appendectomy was performed. Manual reduction was possible in 32 patients. The intussusception was irreducible in 26 patients, and 18 required temporary stomas. Pathologic lead points were found in 11 patients. Average length of hospitalization was 1.5 days after barium enema reduction, 9.6 days after manual reduction, and 13.8 days after bowel resection. There were no recurrences of intussusception after surgical reduction. A significant morbidity rate was observed with a delay in diagnosis. Adequate preoperative preparation and prompt surgical intervention are associated with 100% survival.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Injuries to the abdominal vascular system: how much does aggressive resuscitation and prelaparotomy thoracotomy really help?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The records of 154 patients with 254 abdominal vascular injuries seen over 5 years (1980 to 1985) were reviewed. The overall mortality rate (MR) was 46%. This included 100% (5/5) for blunt injuries, 49% (59/119) for gunshot wounds, and 23% (7/30) for stab wounds. The most common venous injuries and the MRs were: inferior vena cava, 59% (33/56) and iliac veins, 65% (10/16). The most common arterial injuries and the MRs were: aorta, 68% (15/22), iliac artery, 57% (12/21), and superior mesenteric artery, 67% (8/12). Of 84 patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a blood pressure (BP) less than 70 mm Hg, 60 (71%) died, and of 64 patients with four or more associated injuries, 41 (64%) died. Failure to reduce the duration of shock, amount of bleeding, or severity of hypotension before surgery is highly lethal. Of the 42 patients who had shock for more than 30 minutes, 38 (90%) died. Of the 93 patients who received more than 10 U of blood in the ED and operating room (OR) 60 (64%) died. Of the 60 patients presenting to the OR with a systolic BP less than 70 mm Hg, 52 (87%) died. Prelaparotomy cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta for persistent shock is controversial. However, of the 26 patients with this procedure, 12 responded with a sustained increase in systolic BP greater than 90 with five (42%) survivors. Of the 14 no responders, none survived. Of 17 patients with persistent shock without a prelaparotomy thoracotomy, only one (6%) survived. In the high-risk group (admission systolic BP less than 70 mm Hg and four or more associated injuries), if shock was kept to less than 30 minutes and bleeding to 10 U of blood or less, the MR was reduced from 92% (24/26) to 0% (0/12). In patients presenting to the OR with a BP less than 70, a prelaparotomy cross-clamping of the aorta should be considered. In those patients not responding, prolonged surgical efforts are futile.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dextrose administration increases sensory/motor impairment and paraplegia after infrarenal aortic occlusion in the rabbit.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Spinal ischemia with resultant cord infarction is a catastrophic complication of surgical procedures involving the thoracoabdominal aorta. A rabbit spinal ischemia model was used to test if glucose administration would increase neurologic deficit of the lower extremity. Rabbits (2 to 3 kg), anesthesized with halothane, had a snare occluder placed around the aorta just below the left renal artery. After a 2-hour recovery, the aorta was occluded for 15 minutes. Before occlusion animals received an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic glucose (2 gm/kg; n = 11), isotonic mannitol (2 gm/kg; n = 3), or an equal volume of saline solution (n = 11). Four sham-operated animals received glucose and an identical surgical procedure, but the aorta was not occluded. Average blood glucose level at the time of occlusion for the glucose group was 249 +/- 15 versus 156 +/- 6 for the control group (p less than 0.01). At 1, 4, 18, and 24 hours, a neurologic impairment score (1 = normal, 2 = partial impairment, 3 = complete impairment) was assigned. At 4, 18, and 24 hours, the glucose group had significantly greater neurologic impairment than did control groups (p less than 0.02). Glucose administration had an adverse effect in a controlled and highly reproducible model of spinal cord ischemia. Exogenous glucose administration should potentially be avoided during complex aortic reconstruction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Optimal resources for carotid endarterectomy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This review compares the results and costs of carotid endarterectomy (CE) done by a single surgeon over a 1-year period working at both a university hospital (UH) and a community hospital (CH). Hospital and financial records of 157 patients were reviewed, 78 at UH and 79 at CH. The patient populations were matched for age, associated illnesses, and presenting symptoms. The principles of patient management were identical at both hospitals except that shunting requirements were determined by electroencephalographic monitoring at UH. There were no differences in the complication rates, and the combined stroke/mortality rate was 0.6%. The cost of CE was 56% greater on a per patient basis at UH ($3918 versus $6126, p less than 0.001) and 23% greater on a per diem basis at UH ($611 versus $755, p less than 0.001). Patients stayed longer at UH (8.2 days versus 6.6 days at CH, p less than 0.03). These differences are largely explained by three types of delays at UH. First, patients with cardiovascular accidents at UH were kept in the hospital before surgery until maximum improvement occurred whereas patients at CH were allowed to convalesce at home before CE. Patients operated on after a cardiovascular accident spent an average of 17.6 days in UH while a similar group spent only 7.3 days in hospital at CH (p less than 0.03). Second, delays in obtaining angiograms of greater than 2 hospital days occurred in 28% of patients at UH compared with only 10% at CH (p less than 0.05). Third, delays in scheduling operating room time of greater than 2 hospital days occurred in 17% of patients at UH and in only 7% of patients at CH (p less than 0.05). When there were no delays, the cost of treating patients at each hospital was identical, $3483 at CH and $3520 at UH. UH must accept the fact that equally good results can be obtained at CH, and although the potential exists for equal costs at both types of hospitals, the CH provides the service at a lower cost. UH administrators must address these inefficiences if the UH is to compete effectively in the current marketplace.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome: an update.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred sixty-nine patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are reported and compared with the 62 patients reported in 1983. Prompt recognition of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and immediate cessation of heparin administration lowered the complication and death rates from 61% (38/62) to 22.5% (38/169) and from 23% (14/62) to 12% (21/169), respectively. Platlet count and duration of heparin administration were not useful in predicting the outcome of the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome. Patients who received heparin in therapeutic doses were at higher risk for developing complications than were patients receiving lower doses of heparin. Platelet aggregation tests became negative as early as 7 days after discontinuation of heparin but persisted as long as 28 months. Heparin reexposure (2 days to 34 months after positive aggregation studies) was uneventful in 13 of 15 patients, whereas two patients suffered devastating thrombotic complications. Five patients continued to receive heparin despite positive platelet aggregation tests. The serious complications suffered by two of these five patients illustrate the necessity to discontinue heparin as soon as the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is established.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Serum C-reactive protein concentrations in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In a prospective study serum C-reactive protein concentrations were measured in nine patients with "active" pulmonary sarcoidosis (as assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocyte counts, gallium-67 lung scanning, and serial pulmonary function testing), and in five patients with "inactive" disease. Active pulmonary sarcoidosis was associated either with no rise or with only a modest rise in serum C-reactive protein concentrations. In contrast, serum C-reactive protein concentrations in 12 patients with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis were considerably raised. Serum C-reactive protein may thus provide a valuable test in the differentiation of sarcoidosis from conditions which it may mimic and which are known to induce an acute phase response.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Response and acclimatisation of symptomless smokers on changing to a low tar, low nicotine cigarette.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ten symptomless smokers were switched from their usual cigarette to a low tar, low nicotine test cigarette for two weeks to investigate their immediate response and subsequent acclimatisation to the test cigarette. The tar (T) and nicotine (N) yields of the test cigarettes were T = 3.8 mg, N = 0.6 mg; the median yields of the usual cigarettes were T = 16.4 mg, N = 1.4 mg. The subjects were monitored over a six week period comprising a control period (usual cigarette), a test period (test cigarette), and a return period (usual cigarette), each lasting two weeks. The inhaled smoke volume (smoke from the burning tip of the cigarette which is subsequently inhaled) was measured with a non-invasive radiotracer technique. Puffing indices were recorded using an electronic smoking analyser and flowhead cigarette holder. Measurements were made at the beginning of the control period, at the beginning and end of the test period, and at the end of the return period. Subjects kept records of their cigarette consumption during each of the three periods. Apart from a small change in puff duration, cigarettes were smoked in the same way during the control and return periods. Mean and total puff volumes increased with the low tar, low nicotine cigarette but did not change from the beginning to the end of the test period. There was no significant change between the control, test, and return periods for mean inhaled smoke volume, total inhaled smoke volume, or cigarette consumption. It is concluded that when smokers are switched to a low tar, low nicotine cigarette the puff volume increases but there is no change in the inhaled smoke volume or daily consumption.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mesothelioma in Cyprus: the role of tremolite.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- There is a chrysotile mine in the central mountains of Cyprus but no other appreciable source of industrial asbestos. Hence the island was thought to offer ideal conditions to seek pure chrysotile induced mesothelioma. The first reported case was a village woman whose lung tissue contained amphibole asbestos fibres, which were later identified as tremolite. This began a search for the origin of her exposure to asbestos. Our studies have shown that tremolite is widespread, being found, along with chrysotile, in domestic and environmental dust samples. Other cases of mesothelioma have been diagnosed, and the pattern of their distribution suggests that the mine is not the major source of disease. Exposure to tremolite is equally, if not more, important.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Importance of airflow obstruction after thoracoplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty six patients previously treated for pulmonary tuberculosis by thoracoplasty were studied to determine the prevalence and effect of airflow obstruction. The mean (SD) FEV1 was 1.3 (0.65) 1 and the mean forced expiratory ratio (FER) 64% (12%). FEV1 was less than predicted in every patient whereas FER was less than predicted in 30, being below the lower 98th percentile in 15 (42%). In the 18 patients who complained of breathlessness the means of the standardised residuals (SR) for FEV1, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and FER were significantly lower and that for residual volume/total lung capacity (RV/TLC) significantly higher than those for the 18 patients who were not breathless (all p less than 0.0001). There was no difference in the smoking history of the two groups. Only three of the 23 patients in whom reversibility of airflow obstruction was assessed showed a greater than 25% increase in PEF. None showed an increase in FEV1 of greater than 15%. The 18 who were breathless had significantly lower values of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and higher values of arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) (p less than 0.0001). Thirteen of these patients were in chronic respiratory failure (PaO2 less than 8.0 kPa or PaCO2 greater than 5.9 kPa, or both) compared with only one of the 18 who were not breathless. The indices correlating best with PaO2 and PaCO2 were SR FEV1 and SR PEF respectively. SR FEV1 accounted for 34% of the variance in PaO2 and SR PEF for 29% of the variance in PaCO2. Airflow obstruction has been found to be common in patients with a thoracoplasty and to be associated with hypoxia and hypercapnia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Oxygen desaturation during sleep and exercise in patients with interstitial lung disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relations between mean and maximum fall in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) during sleep, hypoxaemia during moderate and maximum exercise, and lung mechanics were studied in 16 patients with interstitial lung disease. Mean and minimum SaO2 during sleep were significantly related to each other and to daytime oxygenation but not to lung mechanics. Although the maximum fall in SaO2 during sleep was similar to the fall during maximum exercise (a level seldom achieved during normal daily activities), profound hypoxaemic episodes during sleep were rare and brief and therefore contributed little to the mean SaO2. The fall in mean SaO2 during sleep was not significant and was considerably less than during moderate exercise (average 0.5 v an estimated 4.5%, p less than 0.05). It is therefore concluded that in patients with interstitial lung disease oxygen desaturation during sleep is mild and less severe than hypoxaemia during exercise.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma in a rural adult population.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in adult populations is not known. To document its prevalence and distribution and to determine the factors associated with it, a random sample of the adult population of Busselton, Western Australia, was studied. Spirometric function, bronchial responsiveness to histamine, and atopic responses to skin prick tests were measured. Respiratory symptoms were determined by questionnaire. Data were obtained from 916 subjects. Of these, 876 underwent a histamine inhalation test and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine (defined as a dose of histamine provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 equal to or less than 3.9 mumol) was found in 10.5%. Another 40 subjects with poor lung function were tested with a bronchodilator and 12 were found to have bronchial hyperresponsiveness (defined as a greater than 15% increase in FEV1), making the total prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness 11.4%. The prevalence of current asthma, defined as bronchial hyperresponsiveness plus symptoms consistent with asthma in the last 12 months, was 5.9%. The distribution of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the studied population was continuous. There was a significant association between it and respiratory symptoms, atopy, smoking, and abnormal lung function (p less than 0.001 for all associations). There was no association with age, sex, or recent respiratory tract infection.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Growth of the bronchial tree in man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Bronchial tree casts were made from one or both lungs from nine children aged from five weeks to 17 years. The branches of the casts were ordered by the method of Strahler, and diameter ratio, length ratio, and branching ratio were determined. From five to 12 weeks the diameter ratio is about 1.35, but by 13 months it has risen to 1.45, indicating a faster rate of growth in the larger airways over the period; thereafter it stays at or above this level. The data show that the peripheral conducting airways are relatively large in diameter at 1-3 months, attaining their adult proportion after one year. In contrast, length ratio shows no trend with age. On the assumption of 25,000 terminal bronchioles, the mean number of orders between terminal bronchiole and trachea was estimated to be about 12.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pulmonary sequestration and related congenital bronchopulmonary-vascular malformations: nomenclature and classification based on anatomical and embryological considerations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pulmonary sequestration spectrum and related congenital lung anomalies present an extremely complex and varied group of bronchopulmonary-vascular malformations. Previous attempts at nomenclature and classification have proved inadequate. In this article we present a classification of the newly named pulmonary malinosculation spectrum, which includes all congenital lung anomalies where there is abnormal connection (that is, malinosculation) of one or more of the four major components of lung tissue--namely, tracheobronchial airway, lung parenchyma, arterial supply, and venous drainage, which in various combinations make up these lesions. We feel that this simple descriptive approach will improve our understanding and management of these complicated lesions and this is supported by the clinical experience we report in the next article.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Congenital bronchopulmonary vascular malformations: clinical application of a simple anatomical approach in 25 cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Congenital malformations of the bronchopulmonary airway and related arterial blood supply are a complex group of lesions in which abnormalities of venous drainage and lung parenchyma may coexist. Twenty five cases have been analysed, by a method whereby each anatomical component is separately considered. All 25 patients had abnormalities of the tracheobronchial tree, with no connection to the abnormal segment in nine cases. The aberrant arterial blood supply was single in 16 cases and multiple in nine cases, one patient from the latter group having a mixed pulmonary and systemic arterial supply to a part of the abnormal segment. Seventeen patients had anomalous venous drainage. In nine of these the vein or veins (they were multiple in four cases) drained the major part or the whole of the lung, whereas the aberrant arterial supply was limited to the right lower zone--that is, mismatched anomalous venous drainage. Abnormalities of lung parenchyma included changes within the lesion (for example, cysts, foregut inclusions) and associated abnormalities of surrounding lung (for example, hypoplasia, abnormal lobation). This information, together with the clinical features and haemodynamic data, was found to be essential for decisions on appropriate management. Patients presenting in infancy with haemodynamic disturbance continue to present major management problems (50% mortality), particularly if there are associated congenital heart defects. The role of aberrant systemic artery occlusion or ligation as a first stage procedure is well established in patients with haemodynamic abnormalities. There may be a place for this procedure in selected patients who have no haemodynamic disturbance at presentation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The crossover lung segment: congenital malformation associated with a variant of scimitar syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three cases of a congenitally misplaced segment of lung are described. In one case the abnormal segment was identified at thoracotomy; it extended from an origin in the right upper lobe across the midline into the left hemithorax. The remaining two patients, with identical radiographic features, were identified in a review of 24 cases of bronchovascular malformation. In all three patients the crossover segment was associated with a variant of the scimitar syndrome: right lung hypoplasia with dextrocardia, aberrant systemic arterial supply to the right lower lobe, and anomalous venous drainage of the whole of the right lung, and in two patients with eventration of the right diaphragm.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Epidemiology of sarcoidosis in the Isle of Man--1: A case controlled study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A case controlled study of 96 cases of sarcoidosis has been carried out in the Isle of Man. Age and sex matched controls were selected at random from the pathology and radiology records, which cover 85% of the resident population, and a second control group was drawn from a tuberculosis register. Special efforts were made to achieve a high level of ascertainment. In this study most cases occurred in young adults. It affected the sexes equally and occurred more frequently in the indigenous Manx population. Thirty eight cases (39.6%) had been in contact with the disease before diagnosis, compared with two (1.2%) of the combined controls. These contacts included members of the same household, colleagues at work, and close friends. A bias may have been introduced as patients would inevitably be more aware of the disease and be more likely to mention previous contact than the controls. Nevertheless, the evidence is considered to support the view that sarcoidosis is a communicable disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Epidemiology of sarcoidosis in the Isle of Man--2: Evidence for space-time clustering.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The case-control test for space-time clustering developed by Pike and Smith was applied to 96 cases of sarcoidosis diagnosed in the Isle of Man from 1962 to 1983. There were significantly more links between cases separated by time intervals of less than 10 years and distances of less than 100 metres than between the others. Analysis of the type of links indicated that clusters consisted of pairs whose contact was by place of residence or work. More linked cases were diagnosed less than three years apart than would be expected by chance. These findings lend support to the idea that sarcoidosis is a communicable disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of the neodymium YAG laser in the management of tracheal tumours [published erratum appears in Thorax 1987 Aug;42(8):640]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty one patients with tracheal tumours (10 primary and 11 secondary) have been treated with the neodymium YAG laser under general anaesthesia. Fourteen of these patients presented with impending asphyxia and in 11 cases this was dramatically relieved with emergency laser treatment. The improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF) ranged from 26% to 512%. The three patients who did not respond were immediately given other treatments but died in hospital. The remaining seven patients were not in severe respiratory distress and were treated electively; all were thought to have benefited from their treatment, the mean increase in PEF being 36%. The improvement obtained in the 11 patients who responded to emergency laser treatment provided time in which to assess the disease carefully and plan the most appropriate longer term management with surgery, radiotherapy, tracheal stenting, or repeat laser treatment. The patients who were treated electively have either not required further treatment of have been managed with repeat laser treatments alone. Laser treatment provides an excellent method of resuscitating patients with life threatening tracheal obstruction and enables subsequent management to be carefully planned. In some cases this longer term management should be with further laser treatment alone.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis treated by thoracoplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- With the help of information provided by the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys the survival up to 1 July 1985 of the 171 patients treated for pulmonary tuberculosis by thoracoplasty at Papworth from 1951 to 1953 was determined. Thirteen (8%) could not be traced, 65 (38%) had died, and 93 (54%) were alive. For those who were traced the survival at 10, 20, and 30 years from the date of operation was 93%, 79%, and 65%. This represents a significantly greater mortality rate than that predicted from the Registrar General's review of deaths in England and Wales (1841-1984). Nineteen patients died from cardiorespiratory failure. Eight of the survivors are known to have developed respiratory failure, five having enjoyed apparently good health before this was precipitated by intercurrent illness or drugs. A stepwise logistic regression analysis using information from the 124 patients for whom full details were available showed significant associations between the development of cardiorespiratory or respiratory failure and a preoperative contralateral artificial pneumothorax, older age at operation, the presence of cavities before operation, and male sex. In a questionnaire 50 of the survivors (57% of those who replied) reported cough, 45 (51%) breathlessness, 41 (47%) wheeze, and 24 (27%) ankle swelling. Nineteen (22%) smoke and the same number now attend a chest clinic. Many patients treated for tuberculosis by thoracoplasty have respiratory symptoms and some are at risk of respiratory failure. There are grounds for considering that they should be reviewed periodically by a chest physician.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Peripheral blood eosinophil counts and bronchial responsiveness.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Bronchial responsiveness (histamine PC20) and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were measured in 23 asthmatic subjects, of whom 14 were atopic and nine non-atopic. In the group as a whole there was an inverse correlation between baseline eosinophil count and histamine PC20 (r = -0.71; p less than 0.001). For atopic subjects a relationship between eosinophil count and histamine PC20 was observed (r = -0.74; p less than 0.01), but there was no correlation between eosinophil count and baseline FEV1 or baseline FEV1 and histamine PC20. For the non-atopic subjects a similar relationship between eosinophil count and histamine PC20 was seen (r = -0.68; p less than 0.05) and a less significant inverse correlation between baseline eosinophil count and baseline FEV1 (r = -0.65; p less than 0.05). These results show a relationship between eosinophil count and non-specific bronchial responsiveness in both atopic and non-atopic asthma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of particle size of bronchodilator aerosols on lung distribution and pulmonary function in patients with chronic asthma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The particle size of bronchodilator aerosols may be important in determining the site of deposition in the lung and their therapeutic effect. The distribution of aerosols (labelled with technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentacetic acid) of two different particle sizes has been studied by gamma camera imaging. The particles had mass median aerodynamic diameters (geometric standard deviations) of 1.4 (1.4) and 5.5 (2.3) micron, and they were administered from a jet nebuliser to eight patients with chronic severe stable asthma. There was no significant difference in peripheral lung deposition with the two aerosols in any patient. The bronchodilator effect of the two aerosols was determined from cumulative dose-response studies. To avoid large doses that might mask possible differences in effect due to aerosol size, small, precisely determined incremental amounts of salbutamol (25-250 micrograms total lung dose) were used. The two doses were given via a nebuliser on separate occasions and the bronchodilator response was measured from FEV1, forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow 30 minutes after each dose. Bronchodilatation was similar with the two aerosols at each dose of salbutamol. There was therefore no difference in distribution within the lung or any difference in bronchodilator effect between an aerosol of small (1.4 micron) particle size and an aerosol of 5.5 microns in patients with severe but stable asthma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of laser treatment on respiratory function in malignant narrowing of the central airways.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty patients with inoperable carcinoma in the trachea or a main bronchus were investigated before and one and 10 days after treatment with a carbon dioxide laser. Patients were assessed by spirometry, maximum flow-volume loops, and a visual analogue score of breathlessness on a scale from 0 (not at all breathless) to 100 (very breathless). At day 10 mean FEV1 had improved from 51.9% to 62.6% of predicted (p less than 0.02) and mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) from 45.3% to 53.1% of the predicted value (p less than 0.05). Improvements in maximum inspiratory and expiratory flows at 50% vital capacity were not significant but the breathlessness score decreased from a mean of 49.1 to 35.3 (p less than 0.01). Improvements in breathlessness were significantly correlated with increases in FEV1 and PEF. Thirteen of the 20 patients had unilateral tumours with partial or complete occlusion of the main bronchus; in these perfusion and ventilation were assessed by radioisotope scans before and 10 days after treatment. Seven of the 13 patients showed an increase in perfusion of the affected lung after treatment but the improvement was small, with a mean increase in unilateral perfusion in the 13 patients of 2.4% of the total counts. Four patients with no perfusion of the affected side showed no significant improvement after laser treatment. Changes in ventilation scans were similar to those in perfusion. It is concluded that laser treatment improves airway function and dyspnoea in malignant narrowing of central airways and that in unilateral obstruction such treatment results, at best, in a small increase in the contribution of the affected lung to perfusion.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Asbestos induced diffuse pleural fibrosis: pathology and mineralogy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Lungs from seven cases of diffuse pleural fibrosis with known asbestos exposure were studied to determine the gross and microscopic pathological features and relate these to the analysed mineral fibre content of the lung. All seven individuals had had substantial exposure, ranging from two to 25 years, and chronic chest problems and at necropsy all cases met the criteria for compensatable disease. Macroscopically, all had extensive visceral pleural fibrosis and extensive areas of adhesions, and four also had discrete parietal pleural plaques. The histological features were similar in all the cases--most strikingly the basket weave pattern of the thickened pleura and a dense subpleural parenchymal interstitial fibrosis with fine honeycombing, extending up to 1 cm into the underlying lung. The similar histological appearances raise the possibility that diffuse pleural fibrosis and pleural plaques have a similar pathogenesis. Amphibole asbestos (crocidolite and amosite) counts were high in six of the seven cases and chrysotile counts in four; four cases had high mullite counts, but the importance of this is not known. It is concluded that diffuse pleural fibrosis is a specific asbestos associated entity, of uncertain pathogenesis, with mineral fibre counts falling between those found with plaques and those in minimal asbestosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pneumococcal serotypes in sputum isolates during acute respiratory illness in Edinburgh.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During the years 1978-83 serotyping was carried out on all sputum isolates of pneumococci obtained from patients in the chest wards of the City Hospital, Edinburgh. In 402 patients with acute respiratory illness the peak isolation rates occurred from January to April, and the serotype distribution was similar to that seen in previous UK studies, the commonest types being 3, 6, 9, 19, 23, and 8. The overall mortality rate was 8.7%, the serotype distribution in fatal cases reflecting the distribution of the whole group. The presence of mixed infection, predominantly with Haemophilus influenzae, was associated with a lower mortality rate of 3.5%. Nearly all patients (92%) were either elderly or had a chronic underlying disease and only one death occurred in a patient under 70 years who had no pre-existing disease. Of the pneumococcal serotypes isolated from the 292 patients with chronic chest disease, 82% are included in the new 23 valent pneumococcal vaccine and the efficacy of this needs to be assessed further in high risk patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mycobacterium malmoense infections in Scotland: an increasing problem.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During 1982-4 20 cases of Mycobacterium malmoense infection were identified in Scotland (13 male, seven female; age 34-82, median 62 years). Features of the disease were obtained from case notes and radiographs of 19 patients and were found to be indistinguishable from those of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Chronic chest disease, predominantly chronic airflow obstruction, was the most frequent associated disease. The organisms showed in vitro resistance in eight patients to rifampicin, in 19 patients to isoniazid, and in all patients to pyrazinamide and p-aminosalicylic acid. Nevertheless, all patients showed an early response to standard combination chemotherapy with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol, with or without pyrazinamide. Five have been cured and none had died of the infection, although four died of unrelated disease. Of nine patients still having treatment, five had relapsed after completing a course of antituberculosis drugs. All had received ethambutol for less than five months. The response to standard drugs was more satisfactory when the course included administration of ethambutol for at least nine months. Currently one new infection with M malmoense occurs in Scotland for every 40 with tuberculosis, and the incidence appears to be rising. In view of this, it is suggested that when tuberculosis is suspected the chemotherapeutic regimen should include ethambutol until the culture results are reported. If these then show M malmoense, ethambutol should be continued in the combination for at least nine months.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Measurement of effective pulmonary blood flow by soluble gas uptake in patients with chronic airflow obstruction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A study was designed to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of rebreathing and single breath soluble gas uptake measurements of effective pulmonary blood flow (Q) in patients with airways obstruction. Both rebreathing (RB) and single breath (SB) estimates of Q were compared with direct Fick and thermodilution (TD) measurements of cardiac output at rest and during exercise in eight patients with chronic, poorly reversible airflow obstruction with mean FEV1 65% predicted and mean FEV1/FVC 53%. The mean (SD) resting values obtained were QRB 3.47 (0.46), QSB 4.75 (1.15), QFick 4.77 (0.97), and QTD 5.15 (0.98). QRB was significantly lower than the other three estimates, which did not differ significantly from each other. Exercise produced significant increases in all four estimates for the group. The mean exercise values were QRB 6.23 (1.19), QSB 7.62 (1.97), QFick 8.97 (1.96), and QTD 9.09 (1.00), both QRB and QSB being significantly less than QFick and QTD. Analysis of variance of the rest, exercise, and combined data showed highly significant relationships with the TD and Fick measurements for both QRB and QSB over the range of values studied. In addition, the reproducibility of QRB and QSB was assessed in 15 other patients with chronic airflow obstruction (mean FEV1 42% predicted, FEV1/FVC 43%) and in 10 normal subjects. The coefficients of intrasubject variability for a single measurement for QRB were 8.7% in normal subjects and 10.2% in patients and for QSB were 11.7% in normal subjects and 16.1% in patients. The group differences from morning to afternoon, between days, and over a month were not significant in the normal subjects. In the patients QRB was slightly higher in the afternoon than in the morning of the same day, but the differences between days and over a month were not significant for either test. Although both tests detected the increase in pulmonary blood flow during exercise, the single breath test was more accurate at rest. Some underestimation was present for rebreathing at rest and for both tests during exercise, but this can be allowed for. In patients with mild airflow obstruction the reproducibility of the soluble gas uptake methods was similar to that of invasive catheter methods of cardiac output estimation. The single breath test in particular was, however, less reproducible in patients with more severe airflow obstruction, and the rebreathing method may be more useful for detecting increases in pulmonary blood flow in these patients.</ABSTRACT>

- Thirteen patients with renal failure and pulmonary oedema were assessed for evidence of increased pulmonary vascular permeability to protein by a double isotope technique. Comparison was made with 10 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, 11 healthy volunteers, and 10 patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome. There was no significant difference in the accumulation of a radiolabelled plasma protein (transferrin) in patients with renal or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and normal volunteers. Patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome showed significantly greater protein permeability (p less than 0.001). In pulmonary oedema associated with renal failure managed by current regimens there was no evidence of increased permeability to transferrin.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Three hundred six patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and had Stage D1 (T0-3,N1-2,M0) disease; 171 patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy with or without immediate adjuvant therapy (hormonal or radiation or both) or conservative (hormonal or radiation or both) treatment alone (n = 135). Follow-up was one-half to eighteen and one-half years (mean, 5 yrs). Immediate adjuvant orchiectomy significantly (P = 0.01) improved survival (87.4% at 10 years) and nonprogression rates for patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, but not for those who had lymphadenectomy. Overall patient survival was significantly better (P = 0.005) after prostatectomy than lymphadenectomy. Residual disease (n = 43) in patients who underwent prostatectomy and received adjuvant treatment (orchiectomy or radiation or both) did not affect disease outcome. Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy with immediate adjuvant orchiectomy provided survival comparable to the expected survival; conservative treatment alone was associated with rapid disease progression and poor survival and significantly (P = 0.02) higher local morbidity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pitfalls in preoperative staging in prostate cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clinical staging in 60 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate was compared with pathologic staging to identify factors which may contribute to staging errors. Understaging was directly related to tumor stage and was documented in 0 per cent of A2, 26.5 per cent of B1, and 66.7 per cent of B2 patients. Capsular invasion was found in 11.8 per cent of B1 and 52.4 per cent of B2 patients, seminal vesicle extension in 17.7 per cent of B1 and 52.4 per cent of B2 patients, and lymph node metastases in 2.9 per cent of B1 and 28.6 per cent of B2 patients. The majority of patients who had unnoticed gross extension of the tumor beyond the prostate underwent transurethral resection of the prostate or failed irradiation therapy prior to radical prostatectomy. The results suggest that intraprostatic or periprostatic changes caused by previous treatment to the prostate may interfere with the preoperative staging.</ABSTRACT>

Diuretic renography was useful in serial evaluation and documentation of progression. The possible mechanism for such progression of obstruction is proposed. Although mild obstruction in the older child and adult can be followed successfully without surgery, it appears that close follow-up of mild obstruction during the first year of life is necessary to detect and assure treatment of progressive obstruction at an optimum age.</ABSTRACT>

The combined therapy was well tolerated by the patients, and complications were not severe and of a transient nature. The majority of patients showed a subjective and objective improvement: 75 per cent of patients had relief of bone pain, and 80 per cent reported relief in urinary symptoms. There was regression or stabilization of the primary tumor in 82.2 per cent. Disappearance or stabilization of osteoclastic lesions on bone scans was noted in 55.5 per cent of patients.

<TITLE>- Elastic fibers in tunica propria of undescended and contralateral scrotal testes from cryptorchid patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Elastic fibers in the tunica propria of the testes from cryptorchid patients and normal fertile adults were examined by light (Weigert resorcin-fuchsin stain) and electron microscopic techniques. In the testes from normal fertile adults, elastic fibers were proved to exist in the tunica propria by light and electron microscopy, and were located in the fibrous and cellular layers of the tunica propria. In the undescended testes from the cryptorchid patients, during prepubertal and pubertal periods, elastic fibers could not be visualized in the tunica propria, but were found after puberty. The positive Weigert reaction of the tunica propria in the undescended testes from postpubertal cryptorchid patients, however, was markedly weaker than that in normal control patients, suggesting diminution of elastic fibers. This diminution of elastic fibers in the undescended testes from postpubertal cryptorchid patients was also substantiated by electron microscopy. However, in the contralateral scrotal testes, elastic fibers appeared during puberty and were observed after puberty in the same manner as in normal testes. Thus, the present study suggested retarded appearance of elastic fibers in puberty and impaired development of those fibers after puberty, in the undescended testes of cryptorchid patients.</ABSTRACT>

- A sixty-seven-year-old white man with prostatic carcinoma was noted to be hypercalcemic and was subsequently found to have a parathyroid adenoma. Review of the literature revealed only 13 prior cases of hypercalcemia in patients with prostate malignancy. In none of those recorded cases was a parathyroid abnormality found, although a complete evaluation was not made in most of the patients. Because of the infrequent occurrence of hypercalcemia and prostatic carcinoma, it is suggested that patients with both disorders be evaluated for causes of hypercalcemia other than those generally associated with malignancy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dissociation between global and regional systolic and diastolic ventricular function during coronary occlusion and reperfusion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Indexes of global ventricular function such as the ejection fraction (EF) and the peak diastolic filling rate (PDFR) are often used to assess the effects of coronary recanalization in patients with myocardial infarction. In this investigation we assessed the relationship between these global indexes and directly measured indexes of regional function during 15 minutes of coronary occlusion followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion in 22 open-chest dogs. A computerized nuclear cardiac probe was used to assess EF and PDFR. Indexes of regional function were measured by Doppler ultrasonic wall-thickening probes. During coronary occlusion, paradoxical systolic thinning occurred and the EF and PDFR decreased an average of 31.6% and 24.4%, respectively. During reperfusion the EF and PDFR improved rapidly and at 60 minutes were similar to baseline. Systolic wall thickening improved more gradually and remained abnormal throughout reperfusion. Likewise, indexes of diastolic function (mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning and late diastolic thinning fraction) recovered slowly and remained abnormal throughout reperfusion (78% and 69.7%, respectively). The correlation between the rate of change of global and regional function was poor during both coronary occlusion and reperfusion. Thus, during coronary occlusion the global and regional indexes of ventricular function undergo directionally similar changes. However, during coronary reperfusion the global indexes do not reflect the slow recovery of the stunned myocardium.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Time course of recovery of "stunned" myocardium following variable periods of ischemia in conscious and anesthetized dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Persistence of regional contractile dysfunction after restoration of blood flow to transiently ischemic myocardium has been well described. To date, most studies have been performed in anesthetized animals. The present investigation compared the time course of recovery of regional segment shortening (percentage of segment shortening) in anesthetized versus conscious dogs subjected to a brief period of total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Periods of occlusion lasting 5, 10, and 15 minutes were followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg intravenously) had a significantly higher heart rate and blood pressure and lower dP/dt than conscious dogs. Coronary artery occlusion resulted in similar degrees of regional dyskinesis or akinesis, indicative of severe myocardial ischemia, in all experiments. During reperfusion, a gradual return of contractile function toward baseline was observed. At the end of the first 15 minutes of reflow, dogs subjected to 5 minutes of coronary occlusion demonstrated approximately 70% of control segment shortening in the previously ischemic zone. Animals subjected to 10- and 15-minute periods of coronary artery occlusion showed approximately 60% and 40% of control segment shortening at the same time point, respectively. The remainder of the 3-hour reperfusion period was characterized by a more gradual recovery of regional segment function. No differences were observed between anesthetized and conscious animals. It is concluded that the time course of functional recovery of postischemic reperfused myocardium is directly related to the duration of coronary occlusion and is similar in conscious and anesthetized dogs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Superiority of intracoronary papaverine to radiographic contrast for measuring coronary flow reserve in patients with ischemic heart disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Measurement of coronary flow reserve has been suggested as an adjunct to anatomic assessment of coronary stenoses in patients with ischemic heart disease. We compared papaverine hydrochloride and radiographic contrast to determine which agent was superior for the determination of coronary flow reserve. Coronary flow reserve was determined during cardiac catheterization by means of digital coronary angiography and parametric imaging. Two groups of patients were studied. Among patients in group 1, coronary flow reserve was determined by means of both papaverine and contrast. In group 1 patients with normal coronary arteries, papaverine-induced flow reserve was greater than contrast-induced reserve in all but one vascular region (n = 9, 4.98 +/- 1.15 vs 3.56 +/- 0.89; p = 0.29). Group 1 patients with coronary disease also demonstrated significantly greater flow reserve with papaverine (n = 25, 2.57 +/- 0.20 vs 1.83 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.01). Group 2 included patients with single-vessel coronary artery stenoses. These patients were studied by means of either papaverine or contrast to determine coronary flow reserve for both the stenotic "ischemic" region and an adjacent nonstenotic, "nonischemic" region. Those patients in group 2 who were studied by means of contrast had a modest difference between flow reserve values in the nonischemic and those in the ischemic regions (n = 15, 1.78 +/- 0.10 vs 1.26 +/- 0.09; p less than .0001) with considerable overlap. Patients studied by means of papaverine had a much greater separation in flow reserve between nonischemic and ischemic regions (n = 22, 2.78 +/- 0.19 vs 1.46 +/- 0.14; p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The clinical significance of exercise-induced left ventricular wall motion abnormality occurring at a low heart rate.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied the relationship between the heart rate at the time of onset of exercise-induced wall motion abnormality and the severity of coronary artery disease in 89 patients who underwent exercise equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography as part of their evaluation for coronary artery disease. Segmental wall motion was scored with a five-point system (3 = normal; -1 = dyskinesis); a decrease of one score defined the onset of wall motion abnormality. The onset of wall motion abnormality at less than or equal to 70% of maximal predicted heart rate had 100% predictive accuracy for coronary artery disease and higher sensitivity than the onset of ischemic ST segment depression at similar heart rate during exercise: 36% (25 of 69 patients with coronary disease) vs 19% (13 of 69 patients), p = 0.01. Wall motion abnormality occurring at less than or equal to 70% of maximal predicted heart rate was present in 49% of patients (23 of 47) with critical stenosis (greater than or equal to 90% luminal diameter narrowing), and in only 5% of patients (2 of 42) without such severe stenosis, p less than 0.001. The sensitivity of exercise-induced wall motion abnormality occurring at a low heart rate for the presence of severe coronary artery disease was similar to that of a deterioration in wall motion by more than two scores during exercise (49% vs 53%) or an absolute decrease of greater than or equal to 5% in exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (49% vs 45%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Augmented preexcitation assessed by scintigraphic phase analysis during atrial pacing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We sought to characterize the effect of augmented preexcitation on the phase image pattern associated with scintigraphic acquisition during conduction via accessory arteriovenous connections. For this reason we assessed phase image scintigraphy, acquired in sinus rhythm and during rapid atrial pacing in 12 patients with documented right (five patients) or left (seven patients) lateral accessory pathways. Augmented preexcitation during atrial pacing was documented at electrophysiologic study in all patients during atrial pacing at similar rates. Phase analysis was abnormal in only 8 patients during sinus rhythm but in all 12 patients during atrial pacing. Atrial pacing brought a significant delay in both mean left and right ventricular phase angles, LV phi and RV phi, respectively. With atrial pacing, the site of earliest phase angle, interpreted to indicate the site of earliest excitation, shifted to the site of the accessory pathway. There was increased relative "prematurity" of the mean phase angle of the ipsilateral ventricle and an absolute increase in the difference between mean and earliest left and right ventricular phase angles, delta phi (LV-RV) and delta phi 0 (LV-RV), respectively. In patients with right-sided pathways, delta phi (LV-RV) increased from 9.5 +/- 12.6 degrees to 47.9 +/- 22.8 degrees, whereas delta phi 0 (LV-RV) increased from 28.1 +/- 18.0 degrees to 67.6 +/- 25.0 degrees (both p less than 0.05). Patients with left-sided pathways demonstrated similar changes in which delta phi (LV-RV) decreased from 2.9 +/- 10.8 degrees to -26.5 +/- 9.0 degrees and delta phi 0 (LV-RV) decreased from 3.4 +/- 14.2 degrees to -27.4 +/- 17.9 degrees (both p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The hemodynamic effects of ventricular pacing with and without atrioventricular synchrony in patients with normal and diminished left ventricular function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relative hemodynamic effects of heart rate, inotropic state, and atrioventricular (AV) synchrony during ventricular pacing were evaluated in 10 patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (0.66 +/- 0.07, mean S.D.) and in eight patients with a diminished LVEF (0.34 +/- 0.18). Hemodynamics were measured at AV intervals of 130, 0, and -130 msec during ventricular pacing at a baseline rate that was 10 pulses/min greater than the resting heart rate, at 130 pulses/min alone, and at 130 pulses/min during continuous intravenous infusion of dobutamine. During baseline ventricular pacing and during ventricular pacing at 130 pulses/min with and without dobutamine, both groups of patients had a significant decrease in cardiac index, stroke volume index, and stroke work index when the AV pacing interval was decreased from 130 to 0 msec. The observed decrease in these three hemodynamic variables was similar when patients with diminished LVEF were compared to patients with normal LVEF. No further significant decrease in cardiac index, stroke volume index, and stroke work index occurred in either group when the AV interval was changed from 0 to -130 msec during baseline ventricular pacing or during ventricular pacing at 130 with and without dobutamine. Beneficial hemodynamic effects occur during ventricular pacing when AV synchrony is maintained at resting heart rates and during increases in heart rate and inotropic state in patients with normal and diminished LVEF.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cephalic vein guide wire technique for implantation of permanent pacemakers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This report describes a modified cephalic vein guide wire technique for the implantation of permanent pacemakers. The procedure was attempted in 11 patients only when pacing leads could not be passed directly into the exposed cephalic vein. Eight bipolar DDD (two leads), two unipolar DDD, and one bipolar VVI (one lead) pulse generators were implanted successfully, with only one relatively minor complication. The cephalic vein guide wire technique provides easy access to the subclavian vein and may allow implantation of most single- and dual-chamber pacemakers with only a cephalic vein cutdown.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Increased afferent vagal responses produced by epicardial application of nicotine on the canine posterior left ventricle.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Vagally mediated vasodepressor reflexes are observed in dogs and patients with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction and may be related to the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. To test whether nicotine and bradykinin produced site-specific vagal vasodepressor and sympathetic vasopressor responses, respectively, we compared blood pressure and heart rate responses to these drugs applied topically at six epicardial sites of the canine left ventricle: midanterior, apical anterior, midlateral, apical lateral, midposterior, and apical posterior left ventricle. In alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs with open chests a felt pad soaked in bradykinin (25 micrograms) or nicotine (50 micrograms) was applied to the test sites. Previous studies indicated that epicardial application of these drugs elicited a sympathetically mediated pressor response and a vagally mediated depressor response, respectively. Vasopressor response to bradykinin did not differ among six test sites in 10 dogs. However, vasodepressor response to nicotine was greater in the midposterior left ventricular epicardium than at other test sites in 16 dogs. A hypertensive response after the initial hypotensive response to nicotine was observed in the midanterior left ventricle and not in any other site. These data indicate that vagal vasodepressor responses to epicardial nicotine are greater in the canine midposterior left ventricle and are compatible with the higher incidence of bradycardia or hypotension during acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction in patients. Sympathetic vasopressor responses to epicardial bradykinin are not site specific. Half of the dogs showed no response to bradykinin or nicotine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Progressive attenuation of the carotid baroreflex control of blood pressure and heart rate during exercise.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- With the use of a variable pressure neck chamber, the effect of supine bicycle exercise on the carotid baroreceptor reflex was investigated in 10 normal volunteers who were studied at rest and during moderate and severe exercise, i.e., at 33% and 66% of their previously determined maximal exercise capacity. Deactivation of the carotid baroreceptors by a decrease in carotid transmural pressure produced a greater (p less than 0.001) increase in mean intra-arterial pressure at rest (+11.2 +/- 0.2 [SE] mm Hg) than during moderate (+9.0 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and severe (+6.1 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) exercise. Heart interval decreased less (p less than 0.005) at rest (-73 +/- 3.2 msec) than during exercise (-0.7 +/- 0.7 msec and -4.6 +/- 0.2 msec, respectively). Furthermore, activation of the carotid baroreceptors by an increase in carotid transmural pressure provoked a greater (p less than 0.005) reduction in mean intra-arterial pressure at rest (-11.5 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) than during exercise (-9.8 +/- 0.1 mm Hg and -7.5 +/- 0.1 mm Hg, respectively), while the lengthening of heart interval was also more (p less than 0.005) pronounced at rest (+97 +/- 4.3 msec) than during moderate (+44 +/- 1.2 msec) and severe (+7.6 +/- 0.3 msec) exercise. Finally, carotid baroreceptor sensitivity was defined as the slope of the changes in blood pressure and heart interval that occurred with increasing (baroreceptor deactivation) and decreasing (activation) neck tissue pressure. On average, baroreceptor sensitivity was consistently smaller (p less than 0.05) during exercise, as compared to rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Influence of nifedipine on arterial baroreflex modulation of heart rate control during dynamic increases in arterial pressure: studies in normal man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Studies in animals have demonstrated that calcium channel blocking agents exert important influences on autonomic mechanisms in addition to their direct vascular effects. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that clinical doses of nifedipine sensitized baroreceptor-mediated control of peripheral vascular resistance in normal human subjects. However, baroreflex control of vascular tone does not necessarily imply parallel control of heart rate. A series of experiments was therefore performed to test the hypothesis that therapeutic doses of nifedipine would potentiate arterial baroreflex modulation of heart rate during ramp increases of arterial pressure in normal volunteers. Arterial baroreflex control was assessed by measuring heart interval (HI) responses to dynamic ramp elevation of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) with bolus administration of phenylephrine (PE) before and after nifedipine or placebo in 19 normal subjects. Arterial baroreflex control was calculated from the slope of the regression of SAP on succeeding HI during the first 18 cardiac cycles following onset of rise of SAP after PE bolus. In 13 subjects, bolus PE produced an increase in SAP from 125 +/- 3 mm Hg to 152 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), with a resultant increase in HI from 1110 +/- 57 msec to 1541 +/- 87 msec (p less than 0.01). The baroreflex response was linear (r greater than 0.80, p less than 0.025) and = 17.8 +/- 3.3 msec/mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Biventricular cardiac hypertrophy in essential hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the major adaptation of the heart to a prolonged increase in the left ventricular afterload in hypertension. However, the structure and function of the right ventricle have received little attention. The present study was designed to assess right ventricular structural changes in patients with established essential hypertension. To accomplish this, M-mode echocardiograms were obtained from 15 healthy normotensive subjects and 35 patients with essential hypertension-15 with normal left ventricles and 20 with clear-cut echocardiographic evidence of LVH. In comparison with the normotensive subjects, right ventricular wall thickness was increased almost twofold in the hypertensive patients with LVH (7.0 +/- 2.1 mm vs 3.7 +/- 0.8 mm; p less than 0.001); there was a significant, direct correlation between right and left ventricular wall thickness in the entire patient population (r = 0.65; p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the left atrial emptying index was significantly reduced in all patients with hypertension regardless of whether LVH was present (p less than 0.001) and suggests early diastolic functional involvement of the left ventricle in hypertension. We therefore conclude that right ventricular hypertrophy is associated with LVH in patients with hypertension, although the changes of LVH are frequently more obvious to the clinician.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Merits and limitations of quantitative treadmill exercise score.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study examined the ability of the treadmill exercise score (TES) in determining the presence and extent of coronary artery disease (CAD). The score was derived from the integrated area of ST segment depression and ST slope in two leads (V5 and a VF), corrected for R wave amplitude, exercise time, and percent of maximum predicted heart rate. The ST segment depression was measured at 80 msec after the J point. There were 34 patients with no significant CAD, 38 patients with one-vessel CAD (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis), and 58 patients with multivessel CAD. The TES showed a considerable scatter in patients with and without CAD. A receiver operating characteristic curve showed different levels of sensitivity and specificity, depending on the cut-point. The TES was similar to ST segment depression in detecting CAD (predictive accuracy, 77% vs 78%, p = NS). A markedly abnormal score (less than -1.0) was seen in 41 patients, of whom 32 (78%) had multivessel CAD. On the other hand, a score greater than 0 was seen in 49 patients, of whom 40 (82%) had no or one-vessel CAD. In 40 patients with TES between -1.0 and 0, 17 (43%) had multivessel CAD and 23 (57%) had no or one-vessel CAD. In 51 patients with nondiagnostic ST changes, the TES correctly classified the extent of CAD in 20 patients (40%). Thus, the TES has a similar accuracy to the ST segment depression criteria in detecting CAD. The extent of CAD can, however, be ascertained in 80% of the patients with very high or very low TES.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hypertension and other risk factors in coronary heart disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Whether systolic or diastolic, labile or fixed, at any age in either sex, hypertension is dangerous. Adiposity, heart rate, alcohol intake, hematocrit, blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides are all related to the occurrence of hypertension in one or both sexes. These factors also contribute to the occurrence of the cardiovascular sequelae of hypertension. The influence of blood pressure on the incidence of cardiovascular disease is independent of other predisposing cofactors but is greatly affected by them. Elevated pressures are often accompanied by hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, elevated fibrinogen, and ECG abnormalities, all of which augment the risk. Coronary disease is now the most common sequela of hypertension, and the excess risk is concentrated in those with an increased low-density lipoprotein/high density lipoprotein ratio, impaired glucose tolerance, and ECG abnormalities, and in cigarette smokers. Hypertension is only a component of a multifactorial coronary risk profile which must be considered when implementing optimal therapy. Both the urgency for treatment and judgment of efficacy should be guided by the multivariate risk profile.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Structure and function of the arteries in hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Like tissues in other parts of the body, those of the heart and blood vessels can rapidly adapt their design. The principles of these differentiated structural changes in response to altered functional demands will be outlined in this report. With respect to arterial resistance vessels in hypertension, any sustained arterial pressure elevation leads to wall (w) hypertrophy, whereas the average inner radius (ri) decreases. The reverse occurs at sustained pressure reductions, and this process is aptly termed "structural autoregulation." By means of this structural autoregulation, wall tension per unit layer (T) remains largely constant when pressure (P) increases (decreases), according to Laplace's law: T = P X r/w. Furthermore, this structural w/ri increase, because it is a local vascular response although it is often considerably modified by neurohormonal "trophic" influences, results in a geometrically based vascular hyperreactivity affecting the systemic precapillary resistance vessels, whereas the structural ri reduction leads to an upward resetting of systemic resistance to flow which is present even at maximal vasodilation (Rmin). Because of this "structural amplifier" principle, an increased systemic resistance can be maintained even at normal vascular smooth muscle activity, and smooth muscle activations may then lead to exaggerated resistance elevations. Thus, a most important positive-feedback interaction is created between even mild functional "pressor" influences, if adequately sustained, and this normal process of structural adaptation. This positive-feedback interaction therefore gradually tends to accentuate the latter element until it entirely dominates the hemodynamics of established hypertension. As the process is induced early and established rapidly, and in primary hypertension often even seems to be genetically reinforced in various ways, it becomes of utmost pathogenetic significance. With respect to the aorta-large conduit arteries, their "Windkessel function" becomes reduced by the same process of adaptive wall thickening. This increases the pulse amplitude and thereby accentuates the systolic afterload of the left heart, the load of which is raised also because of the upward structural resetting of systemic precapillary resistance. Furthermore, the same type of structural adaptation also contributes to the upward resetting of the cardiac, arterial, and renal "barostat" mechanisms, as cardiac and arterial walls become thicker and stiffer, whereas renal preglomerular resistance vessels participate in the upward structural autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of antihypertensive pharmacologic treatment in countering adverse pathophysiological profiles: influence on small arteries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Usually, when antihypertensive therapy is considered in the hypertensive patient, structural cardiovascular changes are already well established and the structure of the cardiovascular system is redesigned to maintain higher than normal pressure. Left ventricular hypertrophy has been shown to be an independent risk factor for all manifestations of coronary heart disease. In hypertension, the increased pressure load over a long period of time induces degenerative changes in, for example, cerebral, renal, and coronary vessels, with well-known clinical consequences. Independent of the primary cause of hypertension, full reversal to normotension will probably occur only when the structurally reset cardiovascular system has been returned to normal dimensions by regression of structural vascular changes. In animal models several forms of antihypertensive treatment have prevented the development of or induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy as well as medial hypertrophy of the vessels. These effects have been related both to the extent of blood pressure reduction and to the degree of inhibition of neurohormonal trophic influences. In humans the results have been somewhat contradictory. Plethysmography has demonstrated a reduction of resistance at maximal dilatation with either combination therapy or pindolol but not with mefruside or atenolol. There may be several explanations for the difficulties in showing regression of structural vascular changes in humans: (1) inadequate treatment of high blood pressure, (2) reflexogenic activation of neurohormonal trophic factors, (3) investigation of an unsuitable vascular bed, or (4) treatment started too late. The ultimate goal in the treatment of hypertension is, of course, reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but normalization of structural cardiovascular changes is clearly the second most important therapeutic goal.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The role of antihypertensive drugs in counteracting adverse influence on large arteries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Studies in humans have shown that chronic elevation of blood pressure induces early alterations in the large arteries, consisting mainly of increased diameter, increased pulse wave velocity, and decreased arterial compliance. Acute reduction of blood pressure, per se, does not necessarily correct these alterations homogeneously. For instance, cadralazine reduced brachial artery diameter and urapidil decreased pulse wave velocity, without accompanying changes in forearm arterial compliance. In contrast, acebutolol, isosorbide dinitrate, nicardipine, and nitrendipine, for the same acute decrease in blood pressure, improved forearm arterial compliance by a concomitant decrease in pulse wave velocity and increase in arterial diameter. To determine whether or not these vascular effects persist with long-term acebutolol therapy, nine hypertensive patients were treated for a period of 3 months. Forearm hemodynamic and cytosolic free calcium concentrations in platelets were simultaneously assessed before and after treatment. Compared with placebo baseline values, chronic acebutolol therapy significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), pulse wave velocity (p less than 0.01), and platelet free calcium concentration (p less than 0.05); forearm arterial compliance was increased (p less than 0.01), but brachial artery diameter did not change. Platelet calcium concentration correlated closely with pulse wave velocity even at constant mean arterial pressure. These findings suggest a relaxant effect of acebutolol on the smooth musculature of large arteries, which is independent of changes in blood pressure and arterial diameter, and possibly mediated by changes in cytosolic calcium levels.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prognosis after cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation associated with acute myocardial infarction (the MILIS Study). Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about whether cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is of long-term prognostic significance. The mortality rate in 849 patients with confirmed AMI was analyzed. The mortality rate during the initial hospitalization was higher for patients in whom VT/VF occurred (27% vs 7%, p less than 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate for patients with primary VT/VF, that is, VT/VF occurring in the absence of hypotension or heart failure, was similar to that of patients who did not have VT/VF (8% vs 7%, difference not significant), whereas the rate for patients with secondary VT/VF was significantly greater than that for patients with no VT/VF (51% vs 7%, p less than 0.001). The timing of occurrence of VT/VF also influenced mortality: Patients in whom VT/VF occurred more than 72 hours after admission had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than did patients in whom it occurred within 72 hours (57% vs 20%, p less than 0.05). All cases of primary VT/VF occurred within the first 72 hours of admission. The long-term mortality rate for hospital survivors was not significantly different for patients who had had VT/VF during acute infarction compared with those who had not (19% vs 21%) (mean follow-up 32 months). Thus, cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate but was not a prognostic factor among hospital survivors. Patients resuscitated from primary VT/VF, which characteristically occurs early after AMI, do not have an adverse prognosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Outcome in suspected acute myocardial infarction with normal or minimally abnormal admission electrocardiographic findings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seven hundred seventy-five consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who were admitted to the cardiac care unit from the emergency room were studied; 107 had normal electrocardiographic findings and 73 had only minimal nonspecific changes. AMI subsequently evolved in 11 patients (10%) with normal electrocardiographic findings and in 6 (8%) with minimal changes, compared with 245 (41%) with frankly abnormal emergency room findings. Only 1 (1%; 95% confidence limits 0.02 to 5%) and 4 (6%; 95% confidence limits 2 to 15%) of those with normal and nonspecific initial electrocardiographic findings, respectively, had a complication for which they potentially benefited from intensive care unit intervention, although many patients received prophylactic therapy. Thus, the initial emergency room electrocardiogram can effectively separate patients into high- and low-risk groups for AMI and serious complications. Admission to a monitored intermediate care ward may be an acceptable practice in patients with chest pain and a normal or minimally changed initial electrocardiogram.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Usefulness of sex steroid hormone levels in predicting coronary artery disease in men.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The relation between sex hormone levels and subsequent risk of a major coronary event was studied in a nested case-control study among 163 men in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial who later had a major coronary event and in 163 controls. Cases and controls were matched for age, serum cholesterol level, randomization group, randomization date and clinic. Blood samples were collected at baseline before randomization and frozen at -70 degrees C. Follow-up extended over 6 to 8 years. Sixty-one patients had a nonfatal acute myocardial infarction and 102 fatal infarction. Total and free testosterone, total and free estradiol, androstenedione and estrone concentrations were measured. There were no significant differences between cases and controls for any sex hormone level. There was also no difference in the ratio of testosterone to estradiol. Controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors did not change these results. These results do not support previous case-control studies of a relation between sex hormone levels and risk of heart attack among men.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prognostic implications of symptomatic versus asymptomatic (silent) myocardial ischemia induced by exercise in mildly symptomatic and in asymptomatic patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) may undergo periods of reversible myocardial ischemia without experiencing angina. To study the prognostic implications of "silent" myocardial ischemia induced by exercise, exercise electrocardiography and radionuclide angiography were performed in 131 consecutive patients with CAD, preserved left ventricular (LV) function at rest and mild or no symptoms during medical therapy. All patients who died during medical therapy were in the subgroup of patients with 3-vessel CAD in whom exercise-induced ischemia developed, which was characterized by both a decrease in LV ejection fraction and ST-segment depression. Patients in whom angina pectoris developed during exercise (54% of all patients) had a greater prevalence of this combined ischemic response to exercise than patients without angina (61% vs 27%, p less than 0.001) and also a greater prevalence of left main or 3-vessel CAD (59% vs 25%, p less than 0.001). However, when inducible ischemia was demonstrated, risk stratification and prognosis were the same whether the ischemic episode was symptomatic or silent. Among patients having both a reduction in ejection fraction and a positive ST-segment response, the likelihood of significant left main narrowing (13% vs 26%), 3-vessel CAD (56% vs 51%) and death during subsequent medical therapy (16% vs 9%) was similar in patients with silent compared to those with symptomatic ischemia. These data indicate that patients in whom angina develops during exercise have a greater prevalence of high-risk coronary anatomy and of inducible ischemia than patients without angina. However, once inducible ischemia is documented, the symptomatic response to exercise appears irrelevant for prognostic or risk stratification considerations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Coronary arteriography performed by a physician assistant.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Funding constraints and an oversupply of cardiologists mitigate against continued training of increasing numbers of cardiology fellows. In some institutions, the workload of the catheterization laboratory is an overriding factor. The ability of a physician assistant to perform some of this work was tested to determine if the number of fellows and the content of the fellowship training program could be uncoupled from the catheterization laboratory workload. Among the first 150 patients in whom coronary arteriography was performed by a physician assistant, no patient died or had a myocardial infarction or stroke. Two patients (1.3%) had minor complications: a retinal embolus and an infected puncture site. The complication rate in 150 consecutive cases performed by fellows was also 1.3%, a small myocardial infarction and a transient ischemic attack. Procedure times for the physician assistant and for the fellows were 41 +/- 13 and 44 +/- 18 minutes for preoperative patients and 62 +/- 24 and 70 +/- 20 minutes for postoperative patients. Corresponding fluoroscopy times were 11 +/- 5 and 12 +/- 7 minutes for the preoperative and 22 +/- 12 and 20 +/- 6 for postoperative patients. Only preoperative fluoroscopy times were statistically different (p = 0.02). Thus, substituting a physician assistant for a fellow to perform coronary arteriography is an option in institutions at which the number of studies exceeds the training needs of fellows.</ABSTRACT>

Multilesion PTCA was defined as a procedure in which a proximal PTCA site had to be crossed to dilate a distal severe narrowing and multivessel PTCA as multiple dilatations without having to cross 1 severe narrowing to dilate another. The clinical and angiographic features of the 2 groups were similar. More sites per patient were attempted among those who underwent multilesion PTCA. Primary success rate per lesion was 86% (236 of 274) among those who underwent multivessel and 73% (155 of 211) among those who underwent multilesion PTCA (p less than 0.001). A success rate of 81% (101 of 124) for proximal lesions among those with multilesion PTCA was not significantly worse than that for those with multivessel PTCA; however, lesions distal to proximal sites had a success rate of only 62% (54 of 87), worse than either those with proximal stenoses or multivessel PTCA (p less than 0.005). Arterial diameter, severity of stenosis or procedural variables did not account for this difference. Complication rates were similar in the 2 groups. Despite a poorer success rate among patients with multilesion PTCA, clinical improvement to functional class 0 or 1 occurred in more than 70% of patients in both groups and was equal in patients with and without successful distal dilatations. Restenosis rates per lesion in patients with multivessel (31%) and multilesion (30%) PTCA were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Angiographic findings when chest pain recurs after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Angiographic and clinical characteristics of 102 consecutive patients who underwent coronary cineangiography for assessment of recurrent angina pectoris after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were reviewed. Based on angiographic findings, patients were classified as having restenosis (n = 63), development of new, significant coronary stenosis (n = 15), incomplete revascularization (n = 9) or no significant coronary artery disease (n = 15). Eighteen clinical and technical characteristics of the study group were analyzed as predictors of angiographic outcome. The groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, number of inflations performed, peak inflation pressure or in the pre- or post-PTCA stenosis or gradient. The time from PTCA to onset of recurrent angina was the most powerful predictor of angiographic outcome. Patients in whom symptoms developed within 1 month of PTCA usually had incomplete revascularization or no coronary narrowing. Restenosis was the most common explanation for chest pain 1 to 6 months after PTCA. Angina recurring more than 6 months after PTCA was usually due to development of new, significant coronary artery narrowings.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Holter monitoring before, during and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for evaluation of high-resolution trend recordings of leads CM5 and CC5 for ST-segment analysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Frequency-modulated Holter monitoring of leads CM5 and CC5 was performed before, during and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in 16 patients with stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery, in 5 patients with stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery, and in 5 patients with stenosis of the right coronary artery. All patients presented with 1-vessel coronary artery disease and stable or unstable angina pectoris. ST-segment analysis was based on high-resolution trend recordings. During balloon inflations all patients had significant (at least 0.1 mV) ST-segment changes in lead CM5. In lead CC5, associated ST-segment deviations were found in 22 of 26 patients. During 29.2 +/- 13.6 hours before PTCA, 90 spontaneous episodes with significant ST-segment deviations were detected in 10 patients. Of these episodes, 17% were characterized by ST-segment deviations in lead CC5 only, 57% by ST-segment deviations in lead CM5 only, and 27% by simultaneous ST-segment deviations in both leads. Asymptomatic episodes occurred twice as frequently as symptomatic episodes (66 vs 34%). Symptomatic episodes were more often characterized by ST-segment deviations of at least 0.15 mV (48 vs 9%, p less than 0.001) and by ST-segment deviations observed in both leads simultaneously (48 vs 15%, p less than 0.001). During 34.8 +/- 10.6 hours after successful PTCA, 5 spontaneous asymptomatic episodes with significant ST-segment deviations were detected in 2 patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Circadian variation in the incidence of sudden cardiac death in the Framingham Heart Study population.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine if sudden cardiac death shows circadian variation, the time of day of sudden cardiac deaths in the Framingham Heart Study was analyzed. Analysis was based on mortality data collected in a standardized manner for the past 38 years for each death among the 5,209 persons in the original cohort. The necessary assumptions about the cause and timing of unwitnessed deaths were made in a manner likely to diminish the possibility of detecting an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death during the morning. In the Framingham study, analyses using these assumptions reveal a significant circadian variation (p less than 0.01) in occurrence of sudden cardiac death (n = 429), with a peak incidence from 7 to 9 AM and a decreased incidence from 9 AM to 1 PM. Risk of sudden cardiac death was at least 70% higher during the peak period than was the average risk during other times of the day. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding in other populations, to collect data regarding medications and to determine activity immediately before sudden cardiac death. Investigation of physiologic changes occurring during the period of increased incidence of sudden cardiac death may provide increased insight into its causes and suggest possible means of prevention.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Success of re-use of cardiac electrode catheters.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The feasibility of cardiac electrode catheter re-use was prospectively evaluated over a 5-year period (1981 to 1986), during which time 178 catheters were used 1,526 times for 847 electrophysiologic procedures. Detailed records of catheter testing and use were maintained. No complications were encountered during the study period. All re-used catheters functioned for cardiac pacing and electrographic recording. Surveillance cultures and biologic indicators revealed that adequate sterilization procedures were used. Thus, electrode catheters may be safely re-used provided a thorough cleaning, testing and record-keeping system is instituted. This may result in lower patient cost (approximately $30 per re-use vs [200 per single use) for electrophysiologic catheterization.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of extrastimulus site and tachycardia cycle length in inducibility of atrial preexcitation by premature ventricular stimulation during reciprocating tachycardia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Preexcitation of the atria during reciprocating tachycardia (RT) by a premature ventricular complex occurring when the His bundle is refractory provides direct evidence of the presence of accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. The impact of ventricular stimulation site and RT cycle length on inducibility of atrial preexcitation was assessed in 38 patients with RT utilizing a single accessory AV connection (right free wall in 5 patients, left free wall in 21 and posterior septal/paraseptal in 12). Extrastimuli were inserted at right ventricular (RV) apical, left ventricular (LV) septal and LV free wall sites. Inducibility of and magnitude of atrial preexcitation increased as stimulation site approached accessory AV connection site. Thus, for RV free wall connections, RV extrastimuli preexcited the atria in 5 of 5 patients, LV septal in 1 of 5 and LV free wall in 0 of 4. For LV free wall accessory connections, RV extrastimuli preexcited the atria in only 3 of 21 patients, compared with 12 of 17 with LV septal and 20 of 21 with LV free wall stimulation. Additionally, the magnitude of atrial preexcitation achieved was related to RT cycle length, diminishing as cycle length shortened. Finally, in a few instances both RV apical and LV free wall extrastimuli failed to elicit preexcitation in patients with a posterior septal connection. Thus, ventricular pacing site and RT cycle length contribute importantly to induction of atrial preexcitation by ventricular extrastimulation technique and should be considered during evaluation of patients with RT in whom accessory AV connections may be present.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Efficacy and tolerance of spironolactone in essential hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The long-term efficacy and tolerance of spironolactone in essential hypertension was evaluated among 20,812 patients referred to the Broussais and St. Joseph systemic hypertension clinics between 1976 and 1985 by using information prospectively collected in the computerized ARTEMIS data bank. In 182 patients (51 men, 131 women) treated with spironolactone alone during a mean follow-up period of 23 months, a mean dose of 96.5 mg decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) by 18 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, below pretherapeutic levels. The BP decrease was greater with doses of 75 to 100 mg (12.4% and 12.2%) than with doses of 25 to 50 mg (5.3 and 6.5%, p less than 0.001), but no additional decrease was found with doses above 150 mg. Plasma creatinine level increased modestly (8.3 mumol/liters), as did plasma potassium level (0.6 mmol/liters) (both p less than 0.001); uric acid level increased, but not significantly (10.5 mumol/liter). Fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol levels did not change, triglyceride levels increased slightly (0.1 mmol/liter, p less than 0.05). These changes were similar in both sexes and were not influenced by length of follow-up. Among the 699 men prescribed spironolactone alone or in association with another antihypertensive treatment, 91 cases of gynecomastia developed (13%). Gynecomastia was reversible and dose-related; at doses of 50 mg or less the incidence was 6.9%, but 52.2% for doses of 150 mg or higher. Despite limitations inherent in the interpretation of data banks, it is concluded that spironolactone administered in daily practice reduced BP without inducing adverse metabolic adverse effects and that in patients with essential hypertension, doses should be kept below 100 mg.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of diltiazem alone and combined with mefruside on cardiovascular response at rest and during exercise, carbohydrate metabolism and serum lipoproteins in patients with systemic hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The antihypertensive effects of the calcium antagonist diltiazem, both alone and combined with the diuretic mefruside, were assessed over 14 months in 36 patients with essential hypertension. Patients received 180 or 270 mg/day; those with inadequate response were given 270 mg/day plus mefruside, 20 mg/day. Both monotherapy and combination therapy significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise. However, adding mefruside did not significantly decrease BP below that achieved with diltiazem alone. After 14 months of therapy, the percentage of responders (patients with at least 10% reduction in diastolic BP at rest) was 64% for all patients, 100% (by definition) for those receiving diltiazem alone and 47% for those receiving the combination. Diltiazem decreased heart rate by 6% (4 beats/min at rest) (p less than 0.05). Combined therapy with mefruside did not further reduce heart rate. There were few adverse effects and no undesirable metabolic effects with either monotherapy or combined therapy. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone levels, carbohydrate metabolism, serum lipoprotein levels and routine laboratory test results were unchanged in both groups at the end of the study. Thus, diltiazem is an effective antihypertensive agent and apparently the combination of diltiazem and mefruside does not potentiate the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem alone during long-term therapy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of the acute hemodynamic response to intravenous nisoldipine (Bay k 5552) and intravenous nifedipine for left ventricular dysfunction secondary to myocardial infarction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Dihydropyridine calcium blocking drugs exert potentially dangerous negative inotropic action in selected patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. In 10 patients peripheral and central hemodynamic effects of nisoldipine were intraindividually compared with nifedipine using a sequential crossover protocol. The drugs were titrated to a similar steady-state reduction of mean arterial pressure by 15 +/- 3% and 15 +/- 2% and systemic vascular resistance by 25 +/- 5% and 17 +/- 2%, respectively. The equi-effective dosage was 0.17 +/- 0.06 microgram/min/kg for nisoldipine and 0.58 +/- 0.1 microgram/min/kg for nifedipine. In contrast to nifedipine, administration of nisoldipine was associated with increases in cardiac index of 0.45 +/- 0.33 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), stroke volume index of 3.91 +/- 3.0 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05) and left ventricular ejection fraction of 4.6 +/- 2.8% (p less than 0.05). Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased with nisoldipine from 11.8 +/- 3.4 to 8.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 20.4 +/- 4.06 to 16.1 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005); these variables were unaffected by nifedipine. Thus, intraindividual comparison revealed no cardiodepressive action of nisoldipine, whereas with nifedipine the conceptually beneficial effect of afterload reduction appears to be offset by intrinsic negative inotropic action. Due to higher vasospecificity and more effective unloading, nisoldipine appears to be superior to nifedipine in patients with left ventricular dysfunction secondary to ischemic heart disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of oral milrinone on end-systolic relations in patients with severe congestive heart failure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The new inotropic agent milrinone has both vasodilator and inotropic cardiovascular effects, but the importance of these effects in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) is controversial. The left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure-diameter relation was used to determine the independent inotropic effect of milrinone. Seven patients with New York Heart Association class III CHF were invasively monitored with right-sided heart catheters and radial arterial lines. M-mode echocardiography was used to measure LV dimensions. The effect of a 10-mg oral dose of milrinone on hemodynamic, echocardiographic and end-systolic variables was determined. End-systolic pressure was measured at the dicrotic notch of the arterial pressure tracing and end-systolic LV dimensions at the time of aortic valve closure. Methoxamine (n = 6) or nitroprusside (n = 1) was used to alter afterload so that the end-systolic pressure-diameter relation could be determined. Arterial vasodilation from milrinone was evidenced by a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (88 +/- 5 to 77 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.025) and an increase in cardiac index (from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.025), with no change in heart rate (80 +/- 5 beats/min). Milrinone decreased preload as assessed by the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (from 17 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and end-diastolic LV diameter (from 7.4 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.4 cm, p less than 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Technical and biologic sources of variability in the mapping of aortic, mitral and tricuspid color flow jets.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The quantification of valvular regurgitation by 2-dimensional Doppler imaging depends on identifying and minimizing variability. Aortic, mitral and tricuspid regurgitant jet areas were measured in 50 patients with sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation to analyze the variables of reading error, valve site, jet size, rhythm and frame rate. One technician recorded jet velocities at 1 frame/cycle at a triggered interval after the electrocardiographic R wave and at frame rates of 7.5 and 15 frames/s. Jet areas from 5 consecutive beats were measured by planimetry by 1 observer. Coefficients of variation between and among groups were compared by analysis of variance; mean values were 14 to 22%. Jets grouped less than 2.5, 2.5 to 5 and greater than 5 cm2 showed the variance of small jets exceeding that of medium and large jets. Aortic regurgitant jets were largest and had smaller variance than mitral tricuspid jets. Variability due to atrial fibrillation and the slower frame rate was marginal. Intraobserver error was 4.3% and interobserver 15.4%. Thus, reproducing jet areas carries a minimum variability of 15% or higher, depending on jet size. Valve site could not be excluded as a separate variable. Comparative quantification is best limited to 1 observer.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Correlation of continuous-wave Doppler assessment of chronic aortic regurgitation with hemodynamics and angiography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifteen patients with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) were studied by cardiac catheterization and continuous-wave (CW) Doppler echocardiography. The slope of the AR CW Doppler signal was higher in patients with severe AR (5.7 +/- 2.1 m/s2) than in those with moderate (2.5 +/- 1.3 m/s2) or mild (1.8 +/- 0.7 m/s2) AR (p less than 0.05). The slopes in patients with mild (less than or equal to 18 mm Hg), moderate (19 to 24 mm Hg) and severe (greater than 24 mm Hg) elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were significantly different (1.9 +/- 0.6, 3.3 +/- 1.2 and 7.1 +/- 0.4 m/s2, respectively, p less than 0.05). Patients with severe AR had shorter pressure half-times than those with mild AR (283 +/- 141 vs 820 +/- 393 ms, p less than 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the slope and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and a weaker inverse correlation between pressure half-time and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = -0.59, p less than 0.05). The end-diastolic pressure gradient estimated from CW Doppler using a simplified Bernoulli equation correlated poorly with the catheter measured gradient (r = 0.59, p less than 0.02). The slope of the CW Doppler signal is a better predictor of severity than pressure half-time and is affected by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in addition to angiographic severity of AR.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Limited value of balloon dilatation in calcified aortic stenosis in adults: direct observations during open heart surgery.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Percutaneous balloon dilatation was recently recommended as a treatment for management of calcified aortic valvular stenosis. This procedure was initially reserved for patients who were not considered surgical candidates; it is now regarded by some as an acceptable alternative for valve replacement. To investigate the validity of this postulate, balloon valvuloplasty was performed under direct vision in the operating room in 16 patients just before excision and replacement of their ossified aortic valve. Changes after valvuloplasty were evaluated by inspection as well as by geometric measurements. The authors found that balloon valvuloplasty did not make a detectable impact on valvular anatomy in about two-thirds of the patients and induced enlargement of the functional aortic orifice judged as "minimal" or "moderate" in one-third of the cases. In no patient was there significant increase in the functional orifice size. Other investigators have shown that hemodynamic and clinical improvement may be induced in some patients by small increases in the aortic orifice; based on the observations herein, such an improvement, if it occurs at all, would be short-lasting; the procedure should be offered only to those who present truly prohibitive risk by standards of modern surgery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Calcific valvular aortic stenosis with and without mitral anular calcium.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Seventy-six consecutive patients, mean age 66 +/- 9 years (+/- standard deviation), with isolated aortic valve replacement for calcific valvular aortic stenosis (AS) were studied. Mitral anular calcium (MAC) was detected by echocardiography in 45 patients (59%). Patients with MAC were older (p less than 0.01), had greater peak systolic aortic valve gradients (p less than 0.025), lower cardiac indexes (p less than 0.025) and smaller valve areas (p less than 0.05) than patients without MAC. Thirty-three percent of patients (15 of 45) with MAC required permanent pacemaker implantation after aortic valve replacement, compared with only 10% of patients (3 of 31) without MAC (p less than 0.025). During the follow-up of 7 years (mean 3.8 +/- 1.6), 27% of patients (12 of 45) with MAC died from cardiac causes, compared to only 7% (2 of 31) without MAC (p less than 0.025). Thus, patients with AS and MAC are older, have more severe AS, more frequently undergo permanent pacemaker implantation after aortic valve replacement and more frequently die of cardiac causes than patients with AS and no MAC during follow-up.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Longitudinal changes in left ventricular architecture and function in peripartum cardiomyopathy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Left ventricular (LV) function was quantitated in 14 patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy, in 10 using 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography and in 4 radionuclide ventriculography, and values were compared with those in 11 normal women in the immediate postpartum period. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes, LV wall mass index and ejection fraction were calculated during the acute phase of the illness and serially through long-term follow-up (mean 24 months). During the acute phase of illness there was marked LV dilatation: mean end-diastolic volume index was 95 +/- 22 ml/m2, vs 67 +/- 9 ml/m2 in control subjects (p less than 0.005), and mean end-systolic volume index was 66 +/- 18 ml/m2, compared to 27 +/- 5 ml/m2 in control subjects (p less than 0.001). Mean heart rates and mean systolic pressures in the patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy and the control subjects were similar, 91 +/- 24 vs 79 +/- 14 beats/min and 120 +/- 14 vs 117 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively. LV wall mass index was higher, 139 +/- 38 vs 96 +/- 8 g/m2 (p less than 0.005), and ejection fraction much lower, 29 +/- 5% vs 67 +/- 5% (p less than 0.001), in control subjects. Five patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy during the acute illness, which showed interstitial fibrosis but no evidence of active inflammation. There was rapid and early improvement in LV function in 13 of 14 patients. Changes in LV volume, mass and ejection fraction all followed an exponential time course during LV remodeling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Frequency and significance of mitral anular calcium in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: analysis of 200 necropsy patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine the frequency and significance of mitral anular calcium (MAC) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), 43 clinical and morphologic variables in 200 necropsy cases of HC were examined. Of 100 patients less than 40 years of age, none had MAC. Of the 100 necropsy patients greater than 40 years, 30 (30%) had MAC, 21 (70%) of whom were women. The mean age of the 30 MAC patients was older than that of the 70 non-MAC patients greater than 40 years of age (66 years vs 53 years). The frequency of MAC increased with age. MAC was present in 3 of 31 patients (10%) aged 41 to 50 years; in 6 of 34 patients (18%) aged 51 to 60 years; in 11 of 21 patients (52%) aged 61 to 70 years; and in 10 of 14 patients (71%) aged 71 to 90 years. Compared with the 70 patients greater than 40 years of age without MAC, the 30 patients greater than 40 years of age with MAC had higher average systemic arterial peak systolic pressure (133 mm Hg vs 113 mm Hg); a larger percentage of the MAC patients had calcific deposits in the epicardial coronary arteries (93% vs 41%) and in the aortic valve cusps (33% vs 6%); and a larger percentage of the MAC patients had severe narrowing by atherosclerotic plaques of 1 or more of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries (47% vs 24%). The frequency of a history of systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and total serum cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dl in the patients with and without MAC was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Echocardiographic features of idiopathic hemochromatosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To characterize cardiac involvement in idiopathic hemochromatosis, clinical records and 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiograms of 24 patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis were reviewed. The 17 men and 7 women were 24 to 80 years old (mean 48). Of 19 patients without valvular, ischemic, hypertensive or other known heart disease, 7 (37%) had structural and functional echocardiographic abnormalities attributed to idiopathic hemochromatosis (group 1) and 12 had normal echocardiographic findings (group 2). Age, gender and laboratory markers of iron overload did not differentiate patients with cardiac dysfunction (group 1) from those without cardiac dysfunction (group 2). In group 1, echocardiographic abnormalities included chamber dilatation and global systolic dysfunction. Increased wall thickness was not a feature of idiopathic hemochromatosis. All group 1 patients had abnormal electrocardiographic findings and cardiomegaly on radiography. Despite therapeutic phlebotomy, 4 patients in this group died, between 0.5 and 30 months after echocardiography, because of congestive heart failure. In conclusion, there is a spectrum of cardiac dysfunction in idiopathic hemochromatosis. In patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis and left ventricular dysfunction, absolute wall thickness is normal. Survival is poor in patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis and severe left ventricular dysfunction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long-term follow-up after aortic valvuloplasty and defect closure in ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The clinical course was studied in 25 patients with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and aortic regurgitation (AR) who had undergone aortic valvuloplasty and VSD closure. Twelve patients had a doubly committed subarterial VSD and 13 had a perimembranous type of VSD. Preoperatively, progressive hemodynamic disturbance after the onset of AR occurred in 11 patients (44%). The follow-up period extended from 6 months to 23 years (mean 10 years). Four patients required prosthetic valve replacement after valvuloplasty. One of these had had initial improvement of the AR but required valve replacement 20 years later; the condition of the other 3 did not improve initially and their valves were replaced 1 month to 8.5 years later. Four other patients had no initial improvement as a result of valvular reconstructive surgery, but the AR did not progress and remained hemodynamically well tolerated. Hence, the overall success rate of the valvuloplasty, defined as improving or preventing progressive AR, was 21 of 25 (84%). Since initial and long-term improvement in aortic valve function can be expected in most patients after valvuloplasty and closure of the VSD, early surgical intervention is recommended in patients with a VSD and AR.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of amplitude-modulated (direct) and frequency-modulated ambulatory techniques for recording ischemic electrocardiographic changes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring of ST-segment configuration has become a useful technique for evaluation of myocardial ischemia. Concern that direct or amplitude-modulated (AM) recording and playback systems have inherent limitations that cause inaccurate ST-segment recordings has led to preference for frequency-modulated (FM) devices. To determine the accuracy of AM and FM ambulatory electrocardiographic systems, the signal was compared from the same set of 2 bipolar leads simultaneously recorded by standard electrocardiography and AM and FM recorders in 14 patients during treadmill exercise. Also, simultaneous AM and FM recorders were compared in 9 ambulatory patients in 16 monitoring sessions. The AM recording system accurately reproduced ST segments recorded during treadmill exercise (range 4.0 mm of ST-segment depression to 2.0 mm of ST elevation) when measured at the J point (r = 0.91, p less than 0.0001), and 0.08 second after the J point (r = 0.95, p less than 0.0001). FM recording was equally accurate (r = 0.89 and 0.95, respectively, p less than 0.0001). Similarly, during ambulatory recording, the AM technique accurately recorded maximal ST depression in each episode as recorded by the FM device (28 episodes, range 0 to 3 mm of ST depression, r = 0.85, p less than 0.0001). Both AM and FM ambulatory electrocardiographic systems can accurately reproduce ST-segment deviation associated with ischemia and can be used to monitor transient ST-segment changes in patients with coronary artery disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Considerations of current methods for drug selection in treating malignant ventricular arrhythmias.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The current burgeoning interest in antiarrhythmic drugs derives in large measure from a growing concern with the enormous problem of sudden cardiac death. Until the latter half of the twentieth century, beyond a nodding acknowledgment of its massive prevalence, this syndrome received but scant attention from the medical profession. In the early 1960s a number of insights changed perceptions as well as practice. These related to 4 postulates: (1) sudden cardiac death, in the majority of victims, was due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias either initiated by or culminating rapidly in ventricular fibrillation; (2) the lethal arrhythmia was not the consequence of irreversible pathomorphologic impairment of the contractile apparatus, but rather the expression of an electrophysiologic derangement; (3) the triggering of ventricular fibrillation was the result of an electrical accident both reversible as well as preventable; (4) the potential victim was identifiable either by the presence of certain grades of ventricular ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ventricular arrhythmias by electrophysiologic techniques. The innovations that have led to these insights and their consequences have been numerous and continuous. Among these are direct current defibrillation, cardioversion, coronary care units, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise stress testing for exposing ventricular arrhythmias, electrophysiologic provocative testing and mapping techniques, overdrive programmable pacemakers as well as implantable defibrillators and cardioverters, and surgical, electrical and laser techniques for ablating the nidus or interrupting the pathways of the arrhythmias.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Combined hemodynamic and scintigraphic assessment of piroximone (MDL 19,205) and comparison with dobutamine and nitroprusside.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The acute hemodynamic responses to intravenous infusion of piroximone (MDL 19,205), a nonglycoside, noncatecholamine agent with positive inotropic activity in vitro, were compared with those of intravenous dobutamine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively, in 2 groups of patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms. Each drug was titrated to optimal dosage (dobutamine, 12.5 +/- 3.9 micrograms/kg/min; nitroprusside, 2.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/kg/min; piroximone 1.4 +/- 0.6 mg/kg) and simultaneous hemodynamic and scintigraphic values were measured. In group 1, the increase in cardiac index was slightly greater with piroximone than with dobutamine (from 1.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 vs 2.4 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.025) and only piroximone significantly decreased left ventricular (LV) filling pressure (from 29 +/- 7 to 22 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Both agents increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure. In group 2, cardiac index increased similarly with nitroprusside and piroximone (1.5 +/- 0.6 to 2.6 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.6 +/- 0.5 liters/min/m2, difference not significant), whereas LV filling pressure decreased slightly less with piroximone (29 +/- 7 to 24 +/- 10 vs 30 +/- 7 to 20 +/- 11 mm Hg, difference not significant). Only nitroprusside reduced mean arterial pressure (88 +/- 13 to 72 +/- 12 mm Hg, p less than 0.001 between drugs). In group 1, systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume ratio increased in 9 of 10 patients taking both piroximone and dobutamine, whereas in group 2, this ratio increased in 7 of 8 patients taking piroximone and declined in 7 of 8 taking nitroprusside.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of afterload reduction (diuretics and vasodilators) on left ventricular volume and mitral regurgitation in severe congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The mechanism by which afterload reduction increases left ventricular stroke volume while decreasing left ventricular filling pressure has not previously been established. In 15 patients with severe congestive heart failure due to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, absolute ventricular volume, ejection fraction and total stroke volume from radionuclide ventriculography were compared with thermodilution stroke volume before and after intensive afterload reduction with vasodilators and diuretics titrated to hemodynamic goals. After 48 to 72 hours, pulmonary artery wedge pressure decreased from 32 +/- 8 to 16 +/- 4 mm Hg and systemic vascular resistance from 1,960 +/- 700 to 1,200 +/- 400 dynes s cm-5. End-diastolic volume decreased from 390 +/- 138 to 301 +/- 126 ml (p less than 0.01) and end-systolic volume from 316 +/- 127 to 241 +/- 111 (p less than 0.01). Ejection fraction did not change and total stroke volume decreased from 74 +/- 22 to 59 +/- 20 ml (p less than 0.01). Simultaneous forward stroke volume by thermodilution increased from 37 +/- 14 to 52 +/- 14 ml (p less than 0.01), and forward fraction increased from 0.55 +/- 0.40 to 0.96 +/- 0.42. Intensive reduction of ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased total ventricular stroke volume by 20% but increased forward stroke volume by 40%. The major effect of intensive afterload reduction for severe congestive heart failure may be the reduction of ventricular volume and mitral regurgitation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of hemodynamic results of anterograde versus retrograde percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (PAV) has been reported in children and in selected adults with aortic stenosis using retrograde arterial catheterization. Some patients, however, cannot undergo retrograde catheterization because of atherosclerotic disease, previous vascular surgery or the presence of vessel tortuosity. Because PAV requires the use of large balloon dilating catheters, extreme bleeding and local arterial damage are potential complications. The results of PAV using the anterograde transseptal approach were compared with those using the retrograde arterial approach. Diminution in aortic gradient and increase in aortic valve area were similar in the 2 groups. Vascular complications were more common using the retrograde approach (4 vs 0). Thus, PAV can be performed successfully using anterograde transseptal catheterization. This technique of PAV could be particularly useful in patients who cannot undergo retrograde arterial catheterization.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mechanism of isoproterenol-induced angina pectoris in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and normal coronary arteries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 14 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and angiographically normal coronary arteries, 8 with angina (group B) and 6 without (group A), the effects of intravenous isoproterenol, 2 to 4 micrograms/min, followed by intravenous propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg, were studied. An intraventricular systolic gradient less than 50 mm Hg, high-quality echocardiograms and cineangiograms and high-fidelity pressure tracings were selection criteria. Hemodynamic and metabolic variables were assessed during basal conditions, after 5 minutes of isoproterenol infusion or at angina and ST-segment depression, and 5 and 10 minutes after intravenous propranolol infusion. Isoproterenol increased the intraventricular systolic gradient more significantly in group B than in group A (102.4 +/- 8.3 vs 52.2 +/- 8.2, p less than 0.0001). Group B also had higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (32.5 +/- 3.9 vs 20.2 +/- 5.7), lower mean arterial pressure (69.7 +/- 3.5 vs 84.7 +/- 4.8) and a smaller increase in coronary sinus flow (176.1 +/- 9.2 vs 261.5 +/- 33.9, all p less than 0.0001), concomitant with lactate release and ST-segment depression. Propranolol promptly reversed hemodynamic and metabolic changes caused by isoproterenol, except for a further coronary sinus flow increase (from 176.1 +/- 9.2 to 219 +/- 14.2 ml/min, p less than 0.001), and heart rate decrease below basal values (57.8 +/- 7.5 vs 79.9 +/- 9.8 beats/min, p less than 0.001) in group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Spontaneous closure of uncomplicated ventricular septal defect.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The charts of 222 patients with a diagnosis of ventricular septal defect (VSD) were reviewed to determine the overall incidence, the prevalence of membranous and muscular defects and the rates of spontaneous VSD closure. VSD diagnosis and location were determined primarily from reports of 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiograms. In a 5-year period, VSDs occurred in 3.85/1,000 live full-term births and 7.06/1,000 live premature births. The VSD closed spontaneously in 20 of 44 patients (45%) followed from birth (University Hospital group) during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Of 165 patients not followed from birth (referred group), the VSD closed spontaneously in 37 (22%). Overall, VSD location was determined in 101 of 209 patients (48%) and was distributed as follows: membranous 66 (65%), muscular 32 (32%) and subpulmonic 3 (3%). Rates of spontaneous closure for membranous and muscular VSDs were 37% and 50%, respectively, for the University Hospital group and 9% and 9%, respectively, for the referred group (no significant difference in either case). Surgical closure was required in 30 of 165 referred patients (18%) and only 1 of 44 University Hospital patients (2%). There was no significant difference in rate of closure for premature vs full-term infants or small vs larger defects. Data for patients followed from birth more likely reflect the true natural history of VSD.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acute complications of catheter therapy for congenital heart disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although therapeutic catheter procedures for congenital heart disease are still developing, the number of procedures being performed allows statistically relevant review of the acute complications. Between January 1, 1984, and February 1, 1987, 417 such procedures were performed at The Children's Hospital, Boston; the age range of the patients was 1 day to 51 years (median 4 years, 6 months). Catheter procedures consisted predominantly of vascular dilations (peripheral pulmonic stenosis, 97; valvular pulmonic stenosis, 67; valvular aortic stenosis, 62; recurrent coarctation, 49) and embolizations (double umbrella device, 36; steel coils, 45). Overall, there were 50 acute complications (12%); 24 (6%) were major and 26 (6%) were minor. The mortality rate was 3 of 417 (0.7%). Complication rates varied between 4% for dilation of recurrent coarctation and 40% for dilation of aortic stenosis. The age of the patients was a factor in complications of vascular access (11 patients), 8 of which occurred in patients younger than 6 months (median 5), and in cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation (4 patients, 3 of whom were younger than 6 months [median 3]). No statistically significant trend toward diminishing overall complication rates was discerned over the 37 months of this study.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nonutility of cineurograms in children with congenital heart disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cineurography is often performed after cineangiocardiography to look for occult congenital urinary tract disease. The accuracy of cineurography was investigated in 171 patients by comparing cineurograms with renal sonograms. One hundred fifteen cineurograms (67%) showed both kidneys well enough to allow assessment of renal structure and function and the results were confirmed in 112 by ultrasonography; 3 cineurograms yielded false-positive results. Limited or no information was obtained from cineurograms of 56 patients (33%) because of nonvisualization or poor visualization of 1 or both kidneys. Of the 11 patients (6%) with urinary tract disease, only 3 were correctly assessed by cineurography. Ultrasonography discovered all 11 renal abnormalities and produced only 1 false-positive result. These data indicate that cineurography is a poor screening test and should be abandoned. When uroradiologic screening is necessary for high-risk patients, sonography is recommended.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Detection of caval obstruction by magnetic resonance imaging after intraatrial repair of transposition of the great arteries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Vena caval obstruction may cause significant morbidity after intraatrial repair of transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Two noninvasive methods of diagnosing vena caval obstruction were compared with cardiac catheterization. Echocardiographically gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiographic evaluation (2-dimensional saline contrast echocardiography and pulsed Doppler flow measurement) were performed on 15 patients 0.7 to 13.5 years after intraatrial repair of TGA (8 Mustard, 7 Senning). At catheterization, complete superior vena cava or partial caval obstruction (gradient greater than 5 mm Hg from cava to systemic venous atrium) was present in 7 of 15 patients. Superior vena cava obstruction was directly visualized by MRI in both patients with catheterization-proved complete superior vena cava occlusion. A dilated azygous/hemiazygous venous complex (greater than or equal to 5 mm cross-sectional diameter) was seen by MRI in 5 of 7 patients with complex or partial vena caval obstruction and in no patient without vena caval obstruction. MRI showed superior vena caval dilatation (ratio of superior vena caval diameter to aortic diameter greater than 1.45) in 3 of 5 patients with partial vena caval obstruction and in 0 of 8 without vena caval obstruction. Direct visualization of narrowing within the atrium was unreliable for any MRI plane because of the 3-dimensional nature of the intraatrial baffle. Two-dimensional saline contrast echocardiography, successfully performed in 12 of 15 patients, detected complete superior vena caval obstruction only in the 2 patients with catheterization-proved complete superior vena cava occlusion. Contrast echocardiography failed to identify any of the 5 patients with partial vena caval obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Electrophysiologic effects of intravenous verapamil in children after operations for congenital heart disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess the effect of verapamil in children with congenital heart disease after surgical correction, an electrophysiologic study was undertaken in 19 patients, 0.8 to 15 years old. Atrial pacing and programmed atrial extrastimulation were performed before and 5 mn after intravenous administration of verapamil. A significant increase in conduction time and refractory periods was observed at the atrioventricular node level. Dual or accessory atrioventricular pathways, present in 14 cases, appear to have been suppressed in 9. The effect on the sinus node was of particular interest: The corrected sinus node recovery time was strongly prolonged by verapamil in 6 patients, 5 of whom had undergone surgery with extensive atrial reconstruction (Senning 2, anomalous pulmonary venous return 3) and 1 of whom had undergone correction of tetralogy of Fallot. Additional effects of verapamil were the disappearance of a sinus node entrance block in 8 patients and emergence of an ectopic pacemaker in 6. Although verapamil has electrophysiologic properties that should make it a useful drug in the treatment of reentry tachycardia, caution is indicated after extensive atrial surgery because sinus node depression may occur.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison in young and elderly patients of pharmacodynamics and disposition of labetalol in systemic hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist drug, were studied in elderly and young hypertensive patients. After receiving intravenous labetalol, elderly patients had a greater maximal mean decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) (39 +/- 8 vs 25 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.02); however, maximal decrease in diastolic BP was similar in elderly (18 +/- 10 mm Hg) and young (17 +/- 6 mm Hg) patients. After receiving oral labetalol, elderly patients had a greater maximal decrease in standing systolic BP (41 +/- 16 vs 16 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and similar decreases in standing diastolic BP (21 +/- 7 vs 17 +/- 9 mm Hg). Sitting maximal BP decreases after oral labetalol treatment were similar in elderly and young patients (12 +/- 16 vs 17 +/- 7 mm Hg systolic and 24 +/- 6 vs 12 +/- 7 diastolic). The decrease in heart rate was greater in young patients after intravenous labetalol administration. To evaluate labetalol pharmacodynamics, a linear model was used. Slope of labetalol concentration vs systolic BP for elderly vs young patients was 0.928 +/- 1.05 vs 0.326 +/- 0.490 ng/ml X mm Hg-1 (difference not significant). The slope of labetalol concentration vs heart rate for elderly vs young patients was 0.176 +/- 0.063 vs 0.406 +/- 0.303 ng/ml X beats/min-1 (p less than 0.05), with 2 elderly patients showing no decrease in heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Monotherapy with the calcium channel antagonist nisoldipine for systemic hypertension and comparison with diuretic drugs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A comparative, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy, randomized, crossover trial was performed in 32 hypertensive patients (initial blood pressure [BP] 165/105 +/- 3/2 mm Hg), most of them obese women, to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of the new calcium channel blocking drug nisoldipine, 10 mg once or twice daily, over 6 weeks compared with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg, in combination with amiloride, 2.5 mg once or twice daily). Adequate 24-hour control of BP (supine diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg) was achieved in 15 of 32 patients (47%) with monotherapy by 1 agent and in 23 of 32 patients (72%) when including those who responded to either agent. Both nisoldipine and the diuretic had a flat dose-response curve. The larger dose of diuretic yielded lower systolic and exercise BP values (erect and supine) than high-dose nisoldipine (p less than 0.05), with less headache (p less than 0.05). In the other 9 patients who did not respond, the combination of nisoldipine 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg)-amiloride (2.5 mg) was administered and yielded a response in 8 patients (overall response including monotherapy 96%). Ten patients were given nisoldipine for an additional period of 6 months, and they required an average dose of 33 mg/day for BP control. In both the 6-week and 6-month studies, nisoldipine monotherapy caused frequent subjective adverse effects. In contrast, in the 6-week study the combination of low-dose nisoldipine and low-dose diuretic gave good BP control with no adverse effects.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cellular telephone transmission of 12-lead electrocardiograms from ambulance to hospital.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Currently, only single-lead, serial telemetry rhythm strips can be transmitted from ambulances. Triage of patients with chest pain and administration of thrombolytic therapy in ambulances is limited by the lack of specific electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis. A new technique is described using cellular telephone transmission of simultaneous 12-lead ECGs from ambulance to hospital to overcome this limitation. A portable 12-lead ECG installed in an ambulance was connected via modern link to a cellular telephone and digitized ECG information was transmitted to an ECG device in the hospital emergency room. Paramedics in the field placed adhesive patch electrodes and attached ECG wires. Field ECGs from 23 patients were compared with corresponding transmitted ECGs. There were no differences in heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval or R- and T-wave axes. Baseline and transmitted ECGs had identical morphologic characteristics. Differences in R-wave amplitude in 5 transmitted tracings compared with hospital-recorded ECGs resulted in computer diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, possibly due to differences in patient position. Twelve-lead ECGs can be easily transmitted from a moving ambulance using cellular telephones. This allows diagnosis before hospital arrival, improves prehospital triage of patients and may facilitate prehospital therapy with lidocaine or streptokinase. In addition, the cellular telephone link can convey both verbal and digitized information and thus improve on current telemetry systems.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of beta-blocking drugs influencing choice in treatment of systemic hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Diuretics and beta blockers are the mainstay in treating mild and moderate systemic hypertension, but there is controversy as to which should be used first. Recent evidence of an increase in sudden death and a greater number of intolerable side effects in the diuretic-treated groups in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial in the U.S. and the Medical Research Council Trial in Great Britain has prompted some to suggest beta blockers as first-line therapy. However, beta blockers also have side effects, such as decreased ventricular function in patients with mild heart failure, increased airways resistance in those with chronic obstructive lung disease, increased plasma lipids, in particular low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased problems in patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with diabetes requiring insulin treatment. Many new beta-blocking drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties allow the physician to choose the best one for each patient. beta-blocking drugs with long durations of action, high levels of bioavailability, beta 1 selectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity appear most suitable for therapy. Cardioselectivity is suggested for patients with obstructive lung disease and peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic patients who take insulin. Long durations of action permit infrequent administration and recently agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have been shown to have less effects on plasma lipid levels. Acebutolol also reduces ventricular arrhythmias, and may therefore be used to reduce sudden death in patients with coronary artery disease. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of beta-blocking drugs can indicate the most appropriate choice for hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Among the risk factors associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery diseases, systemic hypertension and disorders of plasma lipoproteins and apoproteins are very important. Blood lipid changes have been reported with a number of antihypertensive drugs and may conceivably reduce the coronary artery disease-protective benefits of blood pressure reduction. The prevalence of various types of hyperlipoproteinemia among Japanese is discussed, with special reference to the frequency of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. Data concerning the effects of commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs on blood lipids and apolipoproteins are reported.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment of systemic hypertension.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Most patients with high blood pressure (BP) can be managed by using one of 4 classes of compounds: a diuretic, beta blocker, converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium antagonist. It is becoming clear, however, that different patients respond to different drugs and that side effects also vary from 1 patient to another. In many patients in whom 1 drug is not sufficient to lower BP, the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs, particularly a diuretic combined with a beta blocker or a converting enzyme inhibitor, is an effective way of decreasing BP further. An understanding of the mechanisms whereby drugs lower BP and why they are additive with some drugs and not with others is clearly important in the more rational use of drugs. The finding that much lower doses of drugs can be used is also important; the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs may not only be more effective in lowering BP but also have less side effects than a higher dose of a single drug. In patients with more resistant hypertension that is not controlled by 1 or 2 drugs combined, the next logical step is to add a third drug. Before doing this, however, it is important to check that the patient is complying with treatment and to consider secondary causes. Ideally, such patients should be referred to someone with a special interest in high BP as they are more likely to have an underlying cause for their hypertension.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Leucine, glucose, and energy metabolism after 3 days of fasting in healthy human subjects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Adaptations of leucine and glucose metabolism to 3 d of fasting were examined in six healthy young men by use of L-[1-13C]leucine and D[6,6-2H2]glucose as tracers. Leucine flux increased 31% and leucine oxidation increased 46% after 3 d of fasting compared with leucine flux and oxidation after an overnight fast. Glucose production rate declined 38% and resting metabolic rate decreased 8% during fasting. Plasma concentrations of testosterone, insulin, and triiodothyronine were reduced by fasting whereas plasma glucagon concentrations were increased. We conclude that there is increased proteolysis and oxidation of leucine on short-term fasting even though glucose production and energy expenditure decreased.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Biochemical measurements and 24-h dietary recalls were conducted early (18.9 +/- 5.9 wk) and late (35.1 +/- 2.0 wk) in pregnancy in women attending clinics in Montemorelos, Mexico. Mean weight gain per week (0.4 +/- 0.2 kg) and birth weight (3381 +/- 456 g) were normal. Intakes tended to decline during pregnancy and declined significantly for zinc (p less than 0.05) and vitamin B-6 (p less than 0.03). Mean Zn intake late in pregnancy was low (7.8 +/- 3.3 mg/d). Various supplements were taken but none contained Zn. During pregnancy mean plasma Zn levels fell (p less than 0.001) and late in pregnancy 57% of the women had values suggestive of poor Zn status (less than or equal to 8.1 mumol/L). These data indicate that Zn intakes of approximately 8 mg/d will not maintain plasma Zn levels in late pregnancy. Erythrocyte glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (EGPT) index and the index of diamine oxidase (DAO), a vitamin B-6-requiring enzyme of placental origin, were correlated suggesting that DAO index may be useful in evaluating vitamin B-6 status in pregnancy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physical activity and plasma total- and HDL-cholesterol levels in Western Samoan men.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study examines effects of physical activity on plasma total- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and derived variables in Western Samoan men who differ in rural/urban residence and occupation. Rural agriculturalists have significantly higher HDL cholesterol and HDL:total ratio than men employed in either physically active or physically sedentary occupations in an urban setting. Total cholesterol levels do not vary significantly, but when the differences in HDL cholesterol are accounted for, the means for agriculturalists and active workers are significantly lower than those for sedentary workers who do not play sports. These differences in HDL- and non-HDL-cholesterol levels are consistent with measures of physical activity among the groups. Variation in physical activity due to residence and occupation in Western Samoan men is related to lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but not to total cholesterol levels, and some effects may be secondary to differences in body composition.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Protein nutriture of a group of free-living elderly.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The adequacy of the protein intakes of elderly people without overt debilitating diseases was investigated on 691 free-living men and women divided into those aged 60-75 y and those greater than 75 y. In both age groups men and women had average protein intakes of 1.02-1.06 g/kg body weight, values well above the safe level of 0.75 g/kg recommended in a WHO/FAO/UNU report. Although plasma concentrations of albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin declined with age, these were not related to low intakes of protein by individual elderly people. Similarly, upper-arm muscle mass was not less in those elderly people at the lower end of the range of protein intakes. Thus in this population of overtly healthy elderly men and women, there was no evidence of protein deficiency in contrast to other surveys where elderly people with chronic diseases were included.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Protein metabolism in cystic fibrosis: responses to malnutrition and taurine supplementation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Increased protein breakdown has been cited as an important cause of nutrient loss in cystic fibrosis (CF). Taurine deficiency, which is common in CF, may contribute to the increased breakdown. The occurrence of and the benefit of taurine supplementation to abnormal protein metabolism in apparently optimally treated CF were assessed using a 12-mo double-blind crossover technique in 14 well-nourished and seven mildly-moderately malnourished infection-free preadolescent CF children. Muscle protein breakdown (urinary 3-methylhistidine technique) was significantly decreased in well-nourished (1.35% degraded/24 h +/- 0.15, p less than 0.05) and malnourished (1.24 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001) CF children compared with controls (1.50 +/- 0.17, n = 13). Whole-body protein flux, synthesis, and catabolism ([15N]-glycine technique) were similar in all groups. Net protein gain was greater in CF children, particularly those who were well-nourished (0.55 g/(kg X 10 h) +/- 0.35, p less than 0.01) compared with controls (0.16 +/- 0.26). Taurine supplementation did not significantly affect any of the indices. In the absence of infection, protein metabolism in CF children responds appropriately to malnutrition.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Serum protein concentrations and bone mineral content in aging normal men.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Low serum protein levels and low dietary protein intakes possibly influence bone metabolism. To evaluate the relationships among serum protein concentrations, protein intakes, and bone mineral content (BMC), we have examined two populations of normal men. BMC was measured at two radial sites and a vertebral site. Aging was associated with a fall in BMC at all sites. Serum albumin levels also fell with age and were related to BMC. Albumin concentrations were associated with BMC when other variables (calcium and protein intake, vitamin D levels, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium) also were considered. Thus, alterations in protein metabolism may affect BMC and may play a role in the genesis of senile osteopenia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of exercise and food restriction on body composition and metabolic rate in obese women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Obese women (140-180% of ideal body weight) were studied on a metabolic ward during 1 wk of maintenance feeding, followed by 5 wk of 800 kcal/d (liquid formula diet). Five subjects participated in a supervised program of daily aerobic exercise and three subjects remained sedentary. Total weight loss was not different between exercising and nonexercising subjects but significantly more of the weight loss came from fat and less from fat-free mass in the exercising subjects. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) declined similarly in both groups (approximately 20%), even though exercising subjects were in greater negative energy balance due to the added energy cost of exercise. In summary, results from this controlled inpatient study indicate that exercise is beneficial when coupled with food restriction because it favors loss of body fat and preserves fat-free mass.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis by capillary gas-liquid chromatography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A new method is described for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis in stool samples. After sample purification by acid vacuum transfer and concentration by alkaline freeze-drying, SCFAs were measured by gas-liquid chromatography using a capillary column. Peak resolution and reproducibility were superior to SCFA analysis on a conventional glass column. With this new technique SCFA were quantitated in stool samples of six healthy volunteers on a basal diet with and without a fermentable dietary fiber preparation; fiber had no effect on fecal SCFA concentration. In two patients with a short-bowel syndrome, SCFA could be demonstrated in stool samples, indicating active fermentation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Vitamin B-6 status and bioavailability in vegetarian women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- It has been hypothesized that the vitamin B-6 status of vegetarians and nonvegetarians may differ in relation to bioavailability of vitamin B-6. Fasting blood samples and 24-h urine collections were obtained from 13 Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) vegetarian and 16 non-SDA nonvegetarian women aged 50-83 y. The two groups were further subdivided into vitamin users and nonusers. Dietary intake was estimated from a 3-d diet record. Plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) was measured by an enzymatic method. Vitamin B-6 intakes were similar and provided 85% of the RDA for both groups. The vegetarians consumed significantly more crude fiber than the nonvegetarians. No significant differences were found between the two groups for plasma PLP, urinary 4-pyridoxic acid, and urinary vitamin B-6 among vitamin nonusers or for age categories within groups. There appeared to be no adverse effect of fiber on the availability or metabolism of vitamin B-6 between these free-living groups.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of dietary intakes and iron status of vitamin-mineral supplement users and nonusers, aged 1-19 years.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite widespread use of supplements, few studies have been conducted to determine if supplement users have better nutritional status. Using data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), mean values of five iron status indicators (hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, transferrin saturation, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin) and dietary intakes of several nutrients and food groups were compared between regular supplement users and nonusers aged 1-19 y. Users consumed more vitamin C and fruits and vegetables than nonusers in several age-sex groups. No significant differences in mean Fe status indicator values were observed except for hemoglobin for the 3-4-y olds and serum ferritin for the 5-10-y olds. In both cases, users had higher values than nonusers. In general, Fe status was not associated with supplement use but the reason cannot be identified from this survey.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Interrelationships of diet, athletic activity, menstrual status, and bone density in collegiate women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We undertook a case-control study to examine the effect of nutritional factors on menstrual function and bone density in collegiate athletes. Three groups, matched with respect to age, height, and weight, were studied: eumenorrheic collegiate athletes, oligomenorrheic collegiate athletes, and eumenorrheic sedentary collegiate control subjects. Menarche was delayed in the eumenorrheic (13.1 y) and oligomenorrheic (14.3 y) athletic groups compared with the sedentary control subjects (12.2 y) (p less than 0.05). Average bone density tended (p = 0.10) to be lower in the oligomenorrheic athletes (158 mg/mL) compared with the eumenorrheic athletes (184 mg/mL) or sedentary control subjects (173 mg/mL). Dietary fiber intake was significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) in the oligomenorrheic athletes (5.74 g/d) compared with the eumenorrheic athletes (3.62 g/d) or sedentary control subjects (2.97 g/d). We conclude that increased dietary fiber intake is associated with menstrual dysfunction of these collegiate athletes. These factors may contribute to decreased bone density.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dietary calcium intake and bone loss from the spine in healthy postmenopausal women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Controversy exists over the relationship between calcium intake and axial bone loss. We measured bone density of the spine (L2-4) by dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) two times, 7 mo apart, in 76 healthy postmenopausal women aged 40-70 y. Ca intake was assessed by food-frequency questionnaire. Women with a Ca intake less than 405 mg/d lost spine density at a rate that was significantly greater than that of women with an intake greater than 777 mg/d, p = 0.026. There appears to be a threshold of Ca intake below which increased Ca in the diet is likely to be beneficial in reducing spine mineral loss.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ethanol metabolism in postmenopausal women fed a diet marginal in zinc.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Five postmenopausal women aged 50-63 y were fed a diet of mixed Western foods that supplied an average of 2.6 mg zinc/d for 6 mo. Plasma zinc did not change significantly during Zn depletion but increased slightly when Zn was fed. Zn content of blood cellular components and activities of Zn-containing enzymes were not affected by Zn intake. Ethanol tolerance tests performed at the end of control, middle of depletion, end of depletion, and end of repletion showed a change in ethanol metabolism at the end of the low-Zn intake period that was corrected within 1 mo with Zn supplementation. These data suggest that there are homeostatic mechanisms that maintain circulating levels of Zn. Zn and activity of Zn enzymes in tissues may be decreased before changes in circulating Zn levels are seen. Functional indices of Zn biochemistry, such as ethanol metabolism, may be more sensitive indicators of Zn stores and nutriture than circulating Zn.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dietary selenium intake and selenium concentrations of plasma, erythrocytes, and breast milk in pregnant and postpartum lactating and nonlactating women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The selenium status of a group of 23 lactating and 13 nonlactating women was assessed from 37-wk gestation through 6-mo postpartum. The mean overall dietary Se intake of both groups of women was 80 +/- 37 micrograms/d. Plasma and erythrocyte Se levels were lower in the lactating than in the nonlactating mothers both before and after parturition. Breast-milk Se concentrations fell from 20 micrograms/L (0.25 mumol/L) at 1-mo postpartum to 15 micrograms/L (0.19 mumol/L) at 3- and 6-mo postpartum. A weak (r = 0.38) but statistically significant (p less than 0.025) relationship was observed between maternal plasma Se level and breast-milk Se concentration. The dietary Se intake of these lactating North American women appears sufficient to maintain satisfactory Se nutriture in their breast-fed infants during the first 6 mo of lactation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of glucose and glucose polymers on calcium absorption in healthy subjects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Glucose polymers have been shown to enhance intestinal calcium absorption in normal subjects as well as in patients with gastrointestinal disease. Glucose polymers are widely used as an energy source in enteral nutritional supplements and infant formulas. In this study, eight normal subjects underwent 47Ca absorption tests to compare the effect on calcium absorption of carbohydrate given orally as a simple carbohydrate (glucose) or a more complex carbohydrate (glucose polymers). Oral coadministration of glucose with calcium increased the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption by 20% and coadministration of glucose with glucose polymers increased calcium absorption by 27%. This suggests that glucose, derived from glucose polymers by hydrolysis, may be responsible for the positive effect of polymers on calcium absorption. The potential positive effect of coadministration of carbohydrate on calcium bioavailability deserves considerations in the design of calcium supplementation strategies.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Estrogen receptor immunocytochemistry for preoperative determination of estrogen receptor status on fine-needle aspirates of breast cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) of 84 primary breast carcinomas were analyzed immunocytochemically for estrogen receptor (ER) using (ER-ICA) monoclonal antireceptor antibodies. ER-ICA in FNAs was concordant to ER-ICA in histologic biopsies in 87% (P less than 0.0001). In most of the carcinomas, biochemically determined ER status also correlated to ER-ICA. There was no false positive ER-ICA in FNAs compared with ER-ICA in histologic biopsies. In 11 FNAs, ER-ICA was negative, whereas it showed positivity in histologic specimens. The most frequent contributing factors to false negative ER-ICAs of FNAs were ER-ICA-low results in histologic biopsies, a prominent stroma component in these tumors, and low cellularity of FNAs. The biochemical ER values in these cases never exceeded 90 fmol/mg protein. In a minority of cases, false negative results were inexplicable.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cytopathology of opportunistic infection in bronchoalveolar lavage.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Bronchoalveolar lavage is an important tool for the cytologic and microbiologic examination of the lung. Silver- or Papanicolaou-stained slides from 604 lavage specimens from 344 patients were evaluated for the presence of fungal, parasitic, and viral organisms. Yeast, pseudohyphae, or hyphae occurred in 155 specimens (25.7%). Candida was the most frequent opportunistic fungus in immunosuppressed hosts. Patients with clinically significant Candida infection had many budding yeasts and pseudohyphae on cytologic preparations of their lavage fluid. Aspergillus, which occurred in five patients, was readily identified by cytologic examination and by fungal culture. Pneumocystis carinii was found in 14 patients (4%). Cytopathologic characteristics of Herpes simplex or cytomegalovirus were present in four patients (1.2%). In 414 specimens no pathogens were identified by either microbial culture or cytologic examination; usually, these patients had pulmonary hemorrhage, recurrent neoplasia, or therapy-induced lung disease to account for their abnormal chest x-rays. Cytologic and microbiologic examination of lavage fluid readily identified opportunistic pathogens. The ease and low morbidity of bronchoalveolar lavage support its use in the assessment of pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised hosts.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Identification of neutrophils with an oxazine dye.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Used in an alkaline-buffered solution on fixed smears of bone marrow or peripheral blood, the oxazine dye CI basic blue 141 preferentially stained neutrophil granules a bright crimson red. In neutrophils, these granules were numerous, whereas in bands, only a few granules were seen. In other types of blood or bone marrow cells, crimson red granules of the type described were not found to an appreciable degree. Used as a tinctorial stain, this dye may be useful in the study of disorders of neutrophil function and neutrophil physiologic characteristics, as well as in the identification of neutrophils and their distinction from other types of cells.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A novel whole blood capillary technic for measuring the prothrombin time.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The prothrombin time (PT) is frequently performed to monitor anticoagulant therapy. Although relatively simple to perform, it requires venipuncture and laboratory resources for sample handling and analysis. A recently developed capillary whole blood device that uses fingerstick samples was evaluated. Paired capillary whole blood and reference plasma PTs were performed in 858 samples from 732 subjects. The PT for normal volunteers (n = 193) was 11.8 +/- 0.9 seconds with the use of the new instrument and 12.1 +/- 0.5 seconds with the use of the reference method. In samples from 539 patients receiving anticoagulants, the correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.96. Venous whole blood without anticoagulant and capillary whole blood gave equivalent results, which suggests that the fingersticks do not effect the quality of the specimen. Variation in hematocrit between 23.4% (0.34) and 53.8% (0.538) did not alter the performance of the instrument. The new instrument is easy to use and may allow testing by nonlaboratory personnel and patients. It obviates the need for venipuncture, provides immediate results, and appears to be comparable in accuracy to current reference methods.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fluorescence intensity as a quality control parameter in clinical flow cytometry.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The fluorescence intensity (FI) and percentage of immunostained peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were tested as parameters for monitoring quality control of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and the staining procedure. Several potential variables were addressed, including optimal dilutions of MoAbs, standardization of instrument functions with fluorescent microspheres, stability of day-to-day fluorescence detection with fluorescent fixed cells, and effects of separation method and storage conditions on FI and PBL antigens. Although some small (but statistically significant) changes were found in certain tests, in general the FI and percentages of MoAB-positive human PBLs provided information useful in a standardized flow cytometry quality control program. This type of standardization and quality control facilities early discovery of methodologic and reagent problems in the clinical laboratory, as well as the ability to routinely evaluate disease states associated with abnormal antigen density.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A panel approach to the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies for the diagnosis of routinely processed histologically undifferentiated human neoplasms.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The evaluation of antibodies for diagnostic purposes on routinely processed sections of histologically undiagnosable neoplasms presents special problems. The authors have addressed this problem by constructing a panel of putatively mutually exclusive antibodies and testing it on sections of anaplastic neoplasms. Tissue sections of 120 routinely processed histologically undifferentiated large cell human neoplasms with a histologic differential diagnosis of carcinoma versus lymphoma and/or melanoma were stained with a panel of antibodies composed of monoclonal antikeratin AE1, monoclonal antileukocyte common antigens PD7/26 and 2B11, and rabbit anti-S-100 protein. Only cases not diagnosable by routine morphologic examination were included. PD7/26 and/or 2B11 were positive in 61 cases (supporting lymphoma), AE1 was positive in 17 cases (supporting carcinoma), and anti-S-100 was positive in 25 cases (supporting melanoma). Seventeen neoplasms failed to react with any of the panel antibodies. None of the neoplasms reacted with antibodies directed against two or more different antigens. These results indicate excellent specificity (100%) and good sensitivity (86%) of the panel antibodies on histologically undifferentiated neoplasms. These results are significant on two levels: first, as a test of the panel approach to evaluate antibodies on anaplastic neoplasms, and, second, as a demonstration of the diagnostic utility of the specific panel the authors have employed in such cases.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Large intracytoplasmic body in lung cancer compared with Clara cell granule.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Large intracytoplasmic bodies in tumor cells of different pulmonary neoplasms were morphologically studied. In 27 of 105 cases of surgically resected lung tumors, large intracytoplasmic bodies were found in 13 adenocarcinomas, 9 squamous cell carcinomas, and 5 large cell carcinomas. These bodies appeared most frequently in large cell carcinomas and in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, particularly of the Clara cell type. In squamous cell carcinomas, they were seen only in nonkeratinizing polygonal tumor cells. Large intracytoplasmic bodies in different pulmonary tumors and Clara cell granules in Clara cell carcinoma showed similar histochemical staining reactions. Electron microscopically, both large intracytoplasmic bodies and Clara cell granules appeared membrane bound and contained electron-dense matrices. The results suggest that large intracytoplasmic bodies in lung carcinoma cells may be a variant of Clara cell granules, only differing in size.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The diagnostic value of acetylcholinesterase/butyrylcholinesterase ratio in Hirschsprung's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Aganglionosis of large bowel (Hirschsprung's disease; HD) is associated with higher acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE activity). Occasionally, especially in the neonatal period, the AChE activity may not be of diagnostic value. The authors previously reported that simultaneous estimation of butyrylcholinesterase activity (BChE activity) and the determination of AChE/BChE ratio may have discriminatory diagnostic value. They extended this finding to 31 cases of HD, in 16 of which resected tissue was available for study. All cases had histologic confirmation of aganglionosis. The AChE/BChE ratio was found to be higher than 2.0, with the exception of a case in which the biopsy weight was low (i.e., less than 3 mg), even when the AChE activity was normal or borderline. The estimation of AChE/BChE ratio is easy, rapid, and, in the author's experience, of discriminatory diagnostic value.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of fibrin polymerization inhibitors on quantitative measurements of plasma fibrinogen.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A number of reports have highlighted discrepancies between the DuPont aca and fibrometer-based methods for quantitating plasma fibrinogen levels. Although many authors have suggested that the presence of fibrin(ogen) degradation products are in some way responsible for the discrepancies, no direct test of this hypothesis has been carried out. In this report, the authors demonstrate that inhibitors of fibrin monomer polymerization have different effects on the aca and fibrometer assays of fibrinogen. Fibrin polymerization inhibitors allow short soluble fibrin polymers to assemble that can scatter light and are therefore detected by the aca method. However, these short polymers do not gel and thus are not detected by the fibrometer. Therefore, the fibrometer method gives lower fibrinogen values than the aca in the presence of fibrin polymerization inhibitors. The authors also assayed plasma from a patient whose fibrinogen did not polymerize normally and therefore was not measurable by the fibrometer assay. The dysfibrinogenemic plasma assayed by the aca method recorded normal fibrinogen levels. In conclusion, the DuPont aca fibrinogen assay is insensitive to alterations of fibrin polymerization whether from inhibitors or a defective fibrinogen molecule.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evaluation of dipstick urine studies using a scoring system based on test performance characteristics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A weighted scoring system based on the selection of four measures of the performance characteristics of a laboratory test--sensitivity, specificity, and false positive and false negative rates--was devised to provide a rationale basis for ranking and evaluating dipstick urine screening tests as a criterion for elimination of routine urine microscopic examination. Equal weight was assigned to each performance characteristic, and an arbitrarily chosen scoring scale of 100 was selected for simplicity. When a summation procedure was applied to urine studies available in the medical literature, three categories of author acceptability were found: accept: score greater than 80; conditional accept: score 70-80; reject: score less than 70. Studies incorporating leukocyte esterase (LE) were found to have the highest scores and the highest author acceptability, whereas studies lacking LE had the lowest scores and lowest author acceptability. This easy-to-use, weighted scoring system is proposed as a guide for deciding whether dipstick screening tests are acceptable as a way of eliminating routine microscopic examination.</ABSTRACT>

The aspirate contained many cell clusters that were negative for prostatic acid phosphatase and cytologically appeared to be basal cells. The entity of basal cell hyperplasia of the prostate is discussed with reference to its appearance in aspiration cytologic examination. Emphasis is placed upon the possibility that these cells may be mistaken for cancer cells.</ABSTRACT>

The site of exsanguination was distended by tumor, culminating in sudden bursting of the hepatic capsule. Nontraumatic rupture may result from a variety of neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases. Hemoperitoneum secondary to lung carcinoma is rare, and even more so is the association with sudden unexpected death.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency was first described in a Norwegian family as an inborn error of metabolism. Altogether, 35 patients in 18 families have been identified. The authors report the first German patient, who presented with the characteristic clinical features of corneal opacity, proteinuria, and mild anemia. Renal biopsy revealed foam cells and an increased mesangial matrix in the glomeruli. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of LCAT deficiency was obtained by plasma enzyme and lipid analyses. Functional LCAT activity was not detected in incubated plasma by chemical or radiochemical methods, although rocket immunoelectrophoresis indicated that the patient had about one-third of normal LCAT mass. In keeping with other reports of LCAT deficiency, apoE-rich discoidal particles were seen in the patient's high-density lipoprotein fraction by electron microscopic examination.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition; endoscopic surveillance is often performed to search for early adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. In an attempt to detect early changes of malignancy, we have added the use of flow cytometry to routine endoscopic surveillance procedures. DNA histograms were generated from biopsy samples by utilizing a specific DNA fluorochrome (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and flow cytometry. Sixty-three samples from patients with esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal malignancy were analyzed. An abnormal DNA histogram (aneuploidy) was detected in 79% of esophageal malignancies. In addition, aneuploidy was detected in seven patients with Barrett's esophagus, two of whom had dysplasia. DNA quantification with flow cytometry may be a useful adjunct in screening patients with Barrett's esophagus for early malignant change.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Malignant transformation of gastric hyperplastic polyps [see comments]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four hundred and seventy-seven hyperplastic polyps, removed by endoscopic polypectomy, were reviewed with special reference to the appearance of dysplastic foci and their malignant transformation. Focal carcinomas were found in 10 hyperplastic polyps, which corresponded to 2.1% of the total of 477 hyperplastic polyps. The location of cancer was at the head or at the surface of the polyp, and was intramucosal. Dysplastic foci equivalent in the degree of histological atypia to adenoma were found adjacent to the cancerous foci in these 10 polyps. Dysplastic foci were also found in 19 hyperplastic polyps without cancerous foci, which corresponded to 4.0% of the total hyperplastic polyps. In connection with the histogenesis of malignant transformation of hyperplastic polyps, the results of clinicopathological examination and immunohistochemical stains strongly suggested that cancer cells arose from the dysplastic area in hyperplastic polyps, rather than directly from nondysplastic hyperplastic epithelium.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Bacteremia following endoscopic interventions has been repeatedly described. This prospective study was intended to establish the extent to which this condition can occur after endoscopic laser therapy. A total of 32 procedures to treat stenosing processes in the upper gastrointestinal tract had been performed on the 20 patients admitted to the study. The incidence of bacteremia was found to be 34%. Two patients developed sepsis that required antibiotic treatment, despite which, however, one of the patients died. Routine prophylactic antibiotic administration would, at present, appear to represent overtreatment. However, patients with cardiac diseases or artificial heart valves need antibiotic prophylaxis. Should a fever develop in patients undergoing laser therapy, immediate broad-band antibiotic cover is urgently recommended to prevent septic complications.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- In our study of the effect of acute cimetidine administration on acetaminophen metabolism, 10 healthy subjects were given an oral dose of acetaminophen (1 g) before and after administration of cimetidine (800 mg, po). In another experiment, 10 patients with duodenal ulcer received acetaminophen (1 g, po) before and after 2 months of cimetidine treatment (400 mg twice a day, po). Acetaminophen metabolism in blood and urine was studied for 9 h in each experiment. The half-life of acetaminophen was similar either in the absence or presence of both acute and chronic cimetidine administration. Although acute cimetidine ingestion did not affect acetaminophen urinary excretion, prolonged cimetidine treatment resulted in a slight but significant decrease of acetaminophen mercapturate urinary excretion. These findings suggest that, unlike acute cimetidine, prolonged histamine H2 antagonist therapy inhibits acetaminophen oxidation to its reactive metabolite. The clinical relevance of such an interaction remains to be explored.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Immunoreactive neuromedin B and neuromedin C were characterized and measured in rat and human tissue extracts, using radioimmunoassay combined with gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography in order to clarify tissue distribution and molecular structure. There are two distinct systems of bombesin-like peptide found in rat and human tissue. The neuromedin B family, including neuromedin B and big neuromedin B, is a major bombesin-like peptide in the brain; the neuromedin C gastrin-releasing peptide family is found mainly in the alimentary tract. Neuromedin B is the major and big neuromedin B the minor constituent of central nervous neuromedin B immunoreactivity. Gastrointestinal neuromedin C immunoreactivity is composed chiefly of neuromedin C in rats, and two N-terminally extended forms of neuromedin C including gastrin-releasing peptide in man. It is probable that molecular heterogeneity reflects species variation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Change in the extent of colonic involvement in ulcerative colitis: a colonoscopic study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The change over time in the extent of colonic involvement in ulcerative colitis has, to date, been assessed only by radiological means. To study this issue further, we examined, with repeated colonoscopies, 31 patients with ulcerative colitis. Serial biopsies were taken every 5 cm from the most proximal area reached by the colonoscope down to rectum. The endoscopic and histological extents were evaluated, and the severity of the inflammatory process was graded. Clinical scoring also was performed at the time of both colonoscopies. A change of extent was found in 77% of the patients endoscopically, and in 58% histologically, during a mean follow-up period of 17 months. Extension and regression were demonstrated in the same number of patients. In 61% of 62 procedures, there was complete agreement between colonoscopic and histological extents. The histological extent exceeded the colonoscopic extent in 28% of the procedures. We have the impression that change in the disease extent is a frequent event, and may be a part of the natural history of ulcerative colitis, rather than the exception.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Portal hemodynamics after meal in normal subjects and in patients with chronic liver disease studied by echo-Doppler flowmeter.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Changes of portal, superior mesenteric, and splenic venous flows after a meal were studied with the duplex ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter in normal subjects, in patients with chronic active hepatitis, and in those with cirrhosis for 2 h after ingestion of a liquid meal (14% protein, 56% lipid, 30% carbohydrate, 300 kcal). Portal and superior mesenteric venous flows increased significantly throughout the experiment, whereas no significant change occurred in splenic venous flow after the meal in all three groups. The extent of the increase in portal venous flow was significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis, compared with normal subjects and patients with chronic active hepatitis, whereas superior mesenteric venous flow increased to the same extent in all three groups. The sum of superior mesenteric and splenic venous flows was less than the estimated portal venous flow in both normal subjects and patients with chronic active hepatitis; however, this value was greater than the portal venous flow in patients with cirrhosis. The difference widened during postprandial mesenteric hyperemia, indicating an increase of blood flow into the portal-systemic shunts. In conclusion 1) postprandial hyperemia occurs in the intestine, but not in the spleen, to the same extent in patients with chronic active hepatitis or with cirrhosis, as in normal subjects, and 2) a considerable amount of postprandial mesenteric hyperemia bypasses the liver into the systemic circulation of patients with cirrhosis but not in patients with chronic active hepatitis and normal subjects.</ABSTRACT>

Intrahepatic pressure was significantly elevated in the group order of chronic active hepatitis without bridging necrosis (n = 17, 9.2 +/- 3.0 mm Hg), chronic active hepatitis with bridging necrosis (n = 24, 12.3 +/- 5.7), and posthepatitic liver cirrhosis (n = 65, 18.8 +/- 4.2), compared with controls (n = 13, 6.8 +/- 2.7), whereas it was not elevated in the group of idiopathic portal hypertension (n = 9, 7.8 +/- 2.5 mm Hg), acute hepatitis (n = 10, 8.4 +/- 2.6 mm Hg), and chronic persistent hepatitis (n = 23, 7.9 +/- 2.7 mm Hg), compared with controls. As complications, four patients had abdominal discomfort continuing for more than a day; however, patients were allowed to walk after they had rested on their beds for 30 min. In 37 patients (27 with cirrhosis, seven idiopathic portal hypertension, and three others), portal vein and/or hepatic vein catheterization was performed during the same procedure of intrahepatic pressure measurement. Intrahepatic pressure showed significant correlations with corrected wedged hepatic vein pressure (r = 0.91), portohepatic gradient (r = 0.69), wedged hepatic vein pressure (r = 0.79), and portal vein pressure (r = 0.68). Slopes were 0.97, 0.83, 0.66, and 0.65, respectively. In conclusion, intrahepatic pressure reflects hepatic sinusoidal pressure (corrected wedged hepatic vein pressure), and intrahepatic pressure starts to elevate at the stage of chronic active hepatitis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reversibility of gastric dysmotility in cortisol deficiency.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This case documents scintigraphically that gastric dysmotility associated with hypoadrenalism secondary to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was reversed when the adrenal insufficiency was treated. The patient reported upon received almost immediate relief of symptoms after corticosteroid replacement therapy and improvement of gastric motility, as demonstrated by both liquid and solid phase 99mTc-labeled studies. This experience suggests that glucocorticoids are important permissive hormones for normal gastrointestinal motor function and may have a role in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal tract disease.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Duodenal carcinoid tumors are rare. We report two patients with isolated duodenal carcinoid tumors diagnosed accidentally by endoscopy, who were not operated, and were followed for more than 2 yr without evidence of metastasis. Because duodenal carcinoid tumors are slow growing and have a relative benign course, a conservative approach is recommended in old patients with relative contraindications to surgery.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Chylous ascites is an uncommon clinical entity associated with lymphatic obstruction usually caused by underlying malignancy. The authors describe a patient with chylous ascites caused by constrictive pericarditis in the absence of mechanical lymphatic obstruction. Pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of chylous ascites in constrictive pericarditis include augmented lymph production and high impedance to lymph drainage caused by central venous hypertension. After pericardiectomy, the patient's ascites and edema resolved. Constrictive pericarditis should be considered a rare but potentially curable cause of chylous ascites.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of a magnesium-free dialysate on magnesium metabolism during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- While the use of magnesium-containing compounds is usually contraindicated in dialysis patients, the risk of toxicity from hypermagnesemia can be reduced by lowering the magnesium concentration in dialysate. We examined the effects of a magnesium-free dialysate on both serum magnesium level and the peritoneal removal rate of magnesium over 12 weeks in 25 stable patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). After 2 weeks, the serum magnesium level decreased from 2.2 to 1.9 mg/dL (0.9 to 0.8 mmol/L) (P less than .02) and the peritoneal removal rate increased from 66 to 83 mg/d (2.8 to 3.5 mmol/d) (P less than .05), with both values remaining stable thereafter. There was a strong association between these parameters (r = -0.62, P less than .05), suggesting that the serum magnesium level decreased as a result of the initial increased peritoneal removal rate. For an additional 4-week period, a subgroup of nine patients received magnesium-containing, phosphate binding agents instead of those containing only aluminum. During this phase, serum inorganic phosphorus was well controlled. The serum magnesium level increased only from 1.8 to 2.5 mg/dL (0.7 to 1.0 mmol/L) (P less than .05), due in great part to the concomitant 41% rise in peritoneal magnesium removal from 91 to 128 mg/d (3.8 to 5.3 mmol/d) (P less than .05). No toxicity was noted during the entire 16-week study period, nor did serum calcium change. Thus, serum magnesium levels remained within an acceptable range as magnesium-containing phosphate binders were given through the use of magnesium-free peritoneal dialysate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A five-year study of the microbiologic results of exit site infections and peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied the culture results from 321 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) related infections (exit site, tunnel infections, and peritonitis) in 137 patients over a 5-year period to determine the contribution of exit site and tunnel infections to peritonitis and catheter loss. Seventeen percent of peritonitis episodes were associated temporally and by microbiologic results with exit site or tunnel infections. Twenty-one percent of exit site and tunnel infections and 20% of peritonitis episodes resulted in catheter loss. Peritonitis due to Staphylococcus aureus was more likely to be associated with an exit site or tunnel infection and was more likely to result in loss of the catheter than peritonitis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Peritonitis and exit site infections due to Pseudomonas sp also frequently resulted in catheter removal. We found that exit site infections cause significant morbidity in CAPD patients. Further studies in this area are needed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2 and unsaturated somatomedin carrier proteins in children with chronic renal failure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Past measurements of somatomedins in chronic renal failure have yielded conflicting results because compounds that accumulate in renal failure and interfere with the somatomedin assays were not removed from assay systems. After serum somatomedins were separated from inhibitory substances by acid chromatography, we measured levels of the major somatomedins, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-2, in 16 prepubertal children with chronic renal insufficiency and in 16 age- and sex-matched normal children. Radioimmunoassayable IGF-1 levels were 220 +/- 182 (mean +/- SD) ng/mL in children with renal disease, not significantly different from levels of 248 +/- 155 ng/mL found in normal children. Levels of the less potent mitogen IGF-2, measured by radioreceptor assay, were 661 +/- 213 ng/mL in children with renal disease and were significantly greater than those of 433 +/- 139 ng/mL found in normal children (P less than .05). Since all 16 children with renal disease exhibited significant growth delay, we conclude that low serum IGF levels are unlikely to play a role in this growth failure. Further, since unsaturated somatomedin carrier proteins can interfere with the assay and in vitro biologic actions of the IGFs, and since there was more unsaturated carrier protein binding of IGF-1 by the sera of 15 children with renal disease v 15 normal children (17 +/- 3% v 12 +/- 3% binding of [125I]-IGF-1/50 muL serum, P less than .05), we suggest that somatomedin carrier proteins should be evaluated for their role in the growth failure of children with chronic renal failure.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Iron overload and mobilization in long-term hemodialysis patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Iron overload from repeated transfusions of RBCs in long-term hemodialysis patients is a problem of increasing clinical significance. We report on the prevalence of and diagnostic criteria for identification of hemodialysis patients with iron overload. In 150 unselected hemodialysis patients, 62 (41%) had ferritin levels greater than 2,000 ng/mL (normal = 10 to 360 ng/mL). In 16 of these patients, accurate transfusion histories were obtained and ferritin levels correlated with calculated transfusional iron burden (r = 0.553, P less than .05). These patients could be divided into two distinct groups on the basis of their response to a single dose (2 g, IV) of deferoxamine: "high" responders had twice the level of feroxamine (the chelated product of deferoxamine and iron) of the "low" responders (P less than .001). High responders also had significantly higher prevalence of the "hemochromatosis" alleles A3, B7, and B14 than a large group of dialysis patients awaiting transplantation (71% v 37%, P less than .001). In two patients with iron overload and clinically significant bone disease, bone histology revealed prominent iron staining at the calcification front. We conclude that transfusional iron overload is a significant clinical problem in long-term hemodialysis patients, that may also be associated with bone pathology.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Once weekly intraperitoneal therapy for gram-positive peritonitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pharmacokinetics and clinical outcome following a 30 mg/kg/2 L intraperitoneal (IP) dose of vancomycin, which was administered once a week for 3 weeks, was studied in ten continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis. Vancomycin was 91% absorbed following the first dose and rapidly achieved therapeutic serum concentrations, 19 +/- 8 mcg/mL at 1 hour and a peak of 37 +/- 8 mcg/mL at 6 hours. Vancomycin was eliminated slowly with a mean total clearance of 7 +/- 3 mL/min/70 kg and a distribution volume of 1.2 +/- 0.3 L/kg. The resultant mean serum t1/2 over the first week was 184 hours and the mean serum concentration at 168 hours was 10 +/- 4 mcg/mL. Based on the positive clinical outcome (100% cure) among patients with uncomplicated gram-positive peritonitis, the potential use of this alternative vancomycin dosing regimen is proposed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A genetical model for emergenesis: in memory of Laurence H. Snyder, 1901-86.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- When a phenotype is determined by a specific gene combination of several loci, it is called an emergenic trait. Such a trait, although genetically controlled, does not usually run in families, since the specific gene combination can hardly be preserved in the process of reproduction. The present paper suggests a concrete genetical model to account for the phenomenon that there is little resemblance between siblings and parent-child pairs with respect to this trait. The genetical model is multiple homozygosis for all loci involved in the gene configuration. The properties of such a trait in a random mating population for all families, as well as for the segregating families only, are investigated. Some of the difficulties in estimating the genetical parameters on the basis of empirical data are also discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tay-Sachs disease with hexosaminidase A: characterization of the defective enzyme in two patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cases of infantile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) with high residual hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity have recently been described. The clinical presentation of the disease in these patients is identical to that found among Ashkenazi-Jewish patients. Fibroblasts from two such TSD patients had Hex A activity comprising 16% of total Hex when measured by thermal fractionation and quantitation with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (4MUG). Hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine-6-SO4 (4MUGS) by patient fibroblast extracts is catalyzed by an enzyme activity that comprises less than 1% of total Hex. Kinetic analysis of patient Hex A by using 4MUGS revealed Km's similar to that of control Hex A but Vmax's significantly different from that of the control enzyme. The inhibitors N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine-6-PO4 were used to distinguish between active sites associated with the two different subunits of Hex A. A beta-subunit site with little activity toward 4MUGS is sensitive to N-acetylglucosamine but resistant to N-acetylglucosamine-6-PO4. This site accounts for most of the hydrolysis of 4MUG. By contrast, an alpha-subunit site that is sensitive to N-acetylglucosamine-6-PO4 but resistant to N-acetylglucosamine accounts for almost all of the hydrolysis of 4MUGS. In mutant cells, this site retains the ability to bind substrate but is deficient in catalytic activity toward 4MUGS. The pH optima of patients' Hex A is shifted to a more acidic range, and the enzymes are significantly more thermostable than control Hex A. By using the thermal fractionation procedure for serum isozyme discrimination, one parent of each patient is unambiguously classified as heterozygous for the TSD gene whereas the other parent has test values in the grey zone. When parents are tested by use of 4MUGS, however, all four parents are classified as heterozygotes. Comparison of the results of both assay procedures allows the carrier of the atypical TSD allele to be recognized and identifies the probands as compound heterozygotes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- An XXX male resulting from paternal X-Y interchange and maternal X-X nondisjunction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 2-year-old boy was found to have a 47,XXX karyotype. Restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism analysis showed that, of his three X chromosomes, one is of paternal and two are of maternal origin. The results of Y-DNA hybridization were reminiscent of those in XX males in two respects. First, hybridization to Southern transfers revealed the presence in this XXX male of sequences derived from the Y-chromosomal short arm. Second, in situ hybridization showed that this Y DNA was located on the tip of the X-chromosomal short arm. We conclude that this XXX male resulted from the coincidence of X-X nondisjunction during maternal meiosis and aberrant X-Y interchange either during or prior to paternal meiosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The gene encoding human vimentin is located on the short arm of chromosome 10.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The gene for vimentin, an intermediate-filament protein, is growth regulated. We used Southern blot analysis and in situ chromosome hybridization to determine the location of the human vimentin gene. Our results show that there is only one copy of the vimentin gene and that it is located on the short arm of chromosome 10 (10pter-10q23) close to the interleukin-2 receptor gene, which is also growth regulated. In situ hybridization studies suggest that the most likely location of the vimentin gene is 10p13. Sequence similarities and homologies of human vimentin to other genes are presented.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Genetic studies of low-abundance human plasma proteins. VI. Polymorphism of hemopexin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An analytical isoelectric focusing method in 3 M urea followed by immunoblotting has been devised to detect genetic and biochemical variation in the glycoprotein hemopexin (HPX) in human plasma or serum. HPX reveals extensive microheterogeneity with multiple major and minor components that are susceptible to neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that the observed biochemical variation is due to differences in sialic acid content between HPX isoproteins. However, charge differences that persist in HPX isoproteins following neuraminidase treatment suggest the presence of genetically determined HPX variation, and this is confirmed by population and family studies. HPX was found to be monomorphic, with an invariant pattern, in U.S. whites; but it is polymorphic in U.S. blacks, with three alleles controlled by a single locus, a situation that demonstrates an autosomal codominant pattern of inheritance. The HPX 1, HPX 2, and HPX 3 allele frequencies in U.S. blacks are .941, .018, and .041, respectively.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The widespread use of genetic screening, along with mating and reproductive patterns reflecting that information, can significantly alter the genetic structure of populations. Both allele frequencies and mortality could be significantly reduced if carriers of lethal recessive alleles were withdrawn from the mating pool. But schemes to mask deleterious alleles in heterozygous condition could significantly increase the deleterious-allele frequencies while resulting in only a slight reduction in mortality. The immediate and equilibrium consequences of such mating strategies may be quite disparate.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Distribution of beta-thalassemia mutations in south China and their association with haplotypes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- DNA from 93 Chinese beta-thalassemia chromosomes were hybridized to eight different mutant oligomers to determine their specific mutation. Four mutations accounted for 87% of the chromosomes; in descending frequencies, these mutations were codon 41/42, IVS-2 nt654, codon 17, and -28. Since codon 41/42 mutation can be associated with multiple beta-thalassemia haplotypes, codon 41/42 is probably a hot spot for the 4-bp deletion. The distributions of these mutations were mapped to various regions in south China. These data are useful for the planning of prenatal diagnosis programs in other Chinese communities worldwide.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Refractory symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in elderly patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The problem of refractory life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in elderly patients has not been previously studied. To determine if clinical, anatomic, or electrophysiologic variables and prognosis are significantly different in elderly subjects, 49 elderly (68 to 84 years) and 44 younger (44 to 53 years) survivors of refractory symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation secondary to coronary artery disease were studied. Elderly patients displayed more extensive anatomic coronary artery disease, with 80 percent having three-vessel disease in comparison with 30 percent of the younger patients (p less than 0.001). Prior myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiomegaly were more common in the elderly group (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001, and p less than 0.034, respectively), whereas angina was more common in the younger group (p less than 0.001). In 55 percent of the elderly patients and 58 percent of the younger patients, electrophysiologic testing demonstrated inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia that required treatment with an investigative antiarrhythmic drug and/or cardiac surgery, including implantation of an automatic defibrillator. Elderly patients tolerated aggressive evaluation as well as did younger patients, and despite the difference in clinical and anatomic findings, long-term survival curves were similar, although the probability of survival at 20 months was 62 percent in the elderly and 80 percent in the younger patients. This difference in early survival is explained by eight surgical deaths in the elderly group, compared with two in the younger group.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inefficacy of pneumococcal vaccine in a high-risk population.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Use of pneumococcal vaccine remains controversial. To further study this question, 89 patients hospitalized at the Denver Veterans Administration Medical Center with pneumococcal bacteremia were chosen as the case group for a case-control study. The control group was made up of patients matched on the basis of age, date of admission, and comorbid conditions. Vaccination status in the bacteremic patients and control patients was determined, as were pneumococcal serotypes among the bacteremic patients. If the vaccine were protective, vaccination rates should be higher among the control patients, and serotype distribution should be different in vaccinated and nonvaccinated bacteremic patients. There were no differences between vaccination rates among bacteremic patients (29 percent) and control patients (24 percent). Furthermore, 65 percent of the blood isolates from nonvaccinated bacteremic patients were serotypes included in the vaccine, as compared with 69 percent of the isolates in vaccinated bacteremic patients. Pneumococcal vaccine did not appear to be protective in this high-risk population.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- High incidence of relapses in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Clinical study of 38 patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Described in this study are 38 patients who received treatment for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in 15 hospitals in Israel and the New York City area since 1977, when plasma therapy was introduced. Thirty-seven patients received plasma therapy and 30 survived. In 12 patients (37 percent of survivors), relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura developed, manifested by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and less frequently by neurological or renal abnormalities. Six patients had a second relapse, and two had five relapses. To assess the severity of the disease, a scoring system was designed based on the four major manifestations of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura listed above. The patients who died had a significantly higher score than those who survived. The initial episodes and the relapses of patients with relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were milder than those in patients who only had a single episode and survived. Two relapses, however, were fatal, demonstrating that relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is not a benign disorder. Infections, pregnancy and surgery were frequently associated with the initial episodes and the relapses. Hence, patients who recover from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be alerted to the possibility of relapse in association with these conditions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Central nervous system involvement in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. A prospective study of adults in remission.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To identify adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia at risk for the development of central nervous system involvement, we performed periodic cerebrospinal fluid examinations on patients in remission. Among 58 consecutive patients monitored during first remission, central nervous system leukemia developed in nine (16 percent). Four patients, including one who was symptomatic, had central nervous system leukemia detected simultaneously with marrow relapse. Five additional patients were asymptomatic and continue to have bone marrow remission. Following central nervous system and systemic treatment, two of these five patients have never had relapse, and three had relapse in the bone marrow five, 10, and 21 months later. Factors at diagnosis associated with the subsequent development of central nervous system leukemia were elevated leukocyte count, serum lysozyme and lactate dehydrogenase, extramedullary infiltration including splenomegaly, and monocytic (FAB M4 or M5a) morphology. In six of 17 patients (35 percent) with monocytic morphology, central nervous system leukemia developed compared with only three of 41 patients (7 percent) with other subtypes (p = 0.02). Discriminant analysis identified leukocyte count, splenomegaly, and M4 or M5a morphology as the most important risk factors and led to a mathematical formula that correctly identified 90 percent of the patients. Although the risk of central nervous system leukemia in adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia is too low to justify routine prophylaxis, those patients recognized to be at a greater risk should receive prophylaxis or be monitored closely with periodic lumbar punctures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer. Prognostic factors in 1,578 patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This report from the Canadian survey of thyroid cancer describes 1,074 patients with papillary thyroid cancer and 504 with follicular thyroid cancer followed for four to 24 years. The study groups included more patients with "advanced" disease and fewer with "early" disease than in the general population because these patients were referred to radiotherapy cancer centers, sometimes routinely, but often because referring physicians believed that certain clinical features indicated the need for additional treatment. Although this report is subject to all the problems of retrospective studies, a careful assessment of the pretreatment extent of disease combined with a long follow-up period has allowed an analysis of prognostic factors with considerable confidence. Univariate analysis of 12 possible prognostic factors (excluding treatment) demonstrated that nine of them were of statistical significance: postoperative status, age at diagnosis, extrathyroidal invasion, distant metastases, nodal involvement, differentiation, sex, tumor size, and pathologic type (in descending order of importance). Multivariate analysis was carried out using cause-specific survival rates. Independently important prognostic factors at initial treatment were age at diagnosis, extrathyroidal invasion, and degree of differentiation histologically for papillary cancers; and extrathyroidal invasion, distant metastases, primary tumor size, nodal involvement, age at diagnosis, and postoperative status for follicular cancers. The prognostic factors for tumor recurrence were quite different for the papillary and follicular cancers and ranked differently for the two groups.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid. Use in an average health care facility.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fine needle aspiration of the thyroid is suggested as an initial diagnostic procedure in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Some proponents of the procedure, however, believe that fine needle aspiration should be restricted to centers in which each operator obtains at least 500 biopsy specimens annually. Reviewed were 155 biopsy specimens obtained over three and one-half years, and the sensitivity of fine needle aspiration was determined to be 100 percent, the specificity to be 47.4 percent, and the accuracy to be 73 percent. A review of the literature revealed the sensitivity in larger series to range between 92 and 98 percent, specificity to range between 52 and 99.5 percent, and accuracy to range between 56.1 and 91.3 percent. The surgical yield of carcinoma was 64 percent in patients evaluated with fine needle aspiration, whereas the yield was 26 percent in those who underwent surgery without fine needle aspiration. These results appear to justify the use of fine needle aspiration in the evaluation of nodular thyroid disease at average-sized health care centers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- How to classify Raynaud's phenomenon. Long-term follow-up study of 73 cases [published erratum appears in Am J Med 1987 Dec;83(6):A11]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Raynaud's phenomenon without an underlying cause was diagnosed in 96 consecutive patients in 1978 to 1979. Seventy-three patients were available for long-term follow-up. They were classified on initial evaluation as having primary Raynaud's phenomenon (49 patients) when no clinical, laboratory, or serologic abnormality was detected, and as having suspected secondary Raynaud's phenomenon when at least one finding was abnormal. Re-evaluation was performed in 1984 to 1985 after an average duration of Raynaud's phenomenon of 14.9 +/- 12 years. The average duration of the follow-up from initial to final evaluation was 4.7 +/- 1 years. On final evaluation, none of the 49 patients with an initial diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon had evidence of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, whereas 14 of the 24 patients with suspected secondary Raynaud's phenomenon had a definite diagnosis. Among them, there were 13 connective tissue diseases. The study proved that Raynaud's phenomenon without an underlying cause must be followed up for more than two years, contrary to what was recommended previously, before it can be rightly diagnosed as primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Moreover, the results suggested that, in order to distinguish early primary Raynaud's phenomenon from suspected secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, a simple and noninvasive evaluation is sufficient. In this study, the evaluation included history and clinical examination, tests for antinuclear antibodies, radiography of hands, chest roentgenography, and nailfold capillary microscopy.</ABSTRACT>

To determine whether lipoprotein lipid levels are abnormal in SLE and the relation of lipoprotein levels to corticosteroid use, lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured in 46 female patients with SLE and 30 matched control subjects. The patients with SLE had higher levels of plasma triglyceride (134 versus 73 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), cholesterol (201 versus 168 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (121 versus 94 mg/dl; p less than 0.001) than control subjects. The levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein subfraction 3 cholesterol, and apolipoprotein Al were similar in the two groups, but high-density lipoprotein subfraction 2 cholesterol was lower in the patients with SLE (10.2 versus 18.2 mg/dl; p less than 0.001). When patients with SLE treated with prednisone (n = 32) were compared to patients with SLE not treated with prednisone (n = 14), the former had higher triglyceride (158 versus 87 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), cholesterol (214 versus 170 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 versus 103 mg/dl; p less than 0.001) levels. The patients with SLE not treated with prednisone had lipid levels similar to those in control subjects except that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower (49.7 versus 59.0 mg/dl; p less than 0.05). The daily prednisone dosage in the treated patients with SLE correlated with levels of cholesterol (r = 0.38, p less than 0.02), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.40, p less than 0.02), and high-density lipoprotein subfraction 3 cholesterol (r = 0.47, p less than 0.01). Thus, female patients with SLE have a dyslipoproteinemia of the type that would place them at an increased risk for coronary artery disease. Corticosteroids, used in the treatment of SLE, seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of the observed lipoprotein abnormalities.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Impact of multiple comparisons in randomized clinical trials.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The randomized clinical trial is the preferred research design for evaluating competing diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives, but confidence in the conclusions from a randomized clinical trial depends on the authors' attention to acknowledged methodologic and statistical standards. This survey assessed the level of attention to the problem of multiple comparisons in the analyses of contemporary randomized clinical trials. Of the 67 trials surveyed, 66 (99 percent) performed multiple comparisons with a mean of 30 therapeutic comparisons per trial. When criteria for statistical impairment were applied, 50 trials (75 percent) had the statistical significance of at least one comparison impaired by the problem of multiple comparisons, and 15 (22 percent) had the statistical significance of all comparisons impaired by the problem of multiple comparisons. Although some statistical techniques are available, there still exists a great need for future work to clarify further the problem of multiple comparisons and determine how the impact of this problem can best be minimized in subsequent research.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of clindamycin in the treatment of central nervous system toxoplasmosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), central nervous system toxoplasmosis, and hypersensitivity to sulfadiazine were given treatment with clindamycin plus pyrimethamine. All three showed improvement clinically with resolution of symptoms. Two patients had computed tomographic evidence of improvement with reduction in size or clearing of cerebral lesions and the third had resolution of chorioretinitis. Another patient who had a relapse during administration of standard therapy (pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine) had a clinical response when clindamycin was added to this regimen. Clindamycin in combination with pyrimethamine, or as an adjunct to standard therapy, may be useful in the treatment of central nervous system toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sterile splenic abscesses in systemic Weber-Christian disease. Unique source of abdominal pain.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A patient with Weber-Christian disease and relapsing abdominal pain due to sterile splenic abscesses is presented. Histologically, acute and chronic inflammation with focal suppurative infiltrates of phagocytosed fat was detected in the absence of vascular or embolic disease, infection, or other apparent cause. Abdominal discomfort, an uncommon manifestation of Weber-Christian disease, usually is related to mesenteric panniculitis. Sterile splenic abscesses represent a previously undescribed complication of Weber-Christian disease, and another source of abdominal pain in this disorder. Although the precise pathophysiology of sterile splenic abscess formation in Weber-Christian disease is unknown, splenectomy is an effective means of alleviating pain.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lack of myocardial necrosis despite clinical and electrocardiographic criteria of acute transmural infarction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The development of "pathologic" Q waves with ST segment elevation is considered diagnostic of transmural myocardial infarction. Previous reports have suggested that myocardial ischemia without infarction can result in electrocardiographic abnormalities simulating those of acute infarction. However, lack of infarction has been poorly documented in these reports. If real, this phenomenon could have an impact on the management of patients with apparent acute infarction. This study describes a patient with documented severe myocardial ischemia and electrocardiographic evidence of acute transmural myocardial infarction, in whom significant myocardial necrosis has been excluded definitively.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Premenopausal osteoporosis associated with vitamin D-responsive calcium malabsorption. A case report.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A premenopausal woman with severe osteoporosis was found to have impaired calcium absorption, without other evidence of intestinal malabsorption. Although circulating levels of 25-OH-vitamin D and 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D were normal, calcium absorption improved markedly following two weeks of treatment with synthetic 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D. This suggests that a partial intestinal resistance to the actions of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D contributed to the development of her osteoporosis. This case report demonstrates the feasibility of using the calciuric response to a standard oral calcium load to screen for impaired calcium absorption in osteoporotic patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Efficacy of sucralfate and cimetidine in protection of the human gastric mucosa against alcohol injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In order to study whether sucralfate or cimetidine may protect human gastric mucosa against alcohol injury, 28 healthy volunteers were pretreated with either: (1) placebo 1 g; (2) cimetidine (Tagamet) 300 mg; or (3) sucralfate (Carafate) 1 g. One hour later, 100 ml of 40 percent ethanol was sprayed directly on the gastric mucosa of the greater curvature during an endoscopic examination. Gastric mucosal changes were assessed by endoscopic appearance (according to grading scale) and by histology. In placebo-pretreated subjects, alcohol produced prominent mucosal damage (endoscopic score, 3.9 +/- 0.3, histologic score, 4.0 +/- 1.1 at 30 minutes). Cimetidine alkalinized gastric pH but did not prevent alcohol-induced damage (endoscopic score, 4.0 +/- 0.6; histologic score, 3.8 +/- 1.1, at 30 minutes). Sucralfate reduced endoscopic and histologic features of alcohol injury (endoscopic score, 1.8 +/- 0.6; histologic score, 1.8 +/- 1.1, at 30 minutes) without affecting gastric luminal pH. Reduction of alcohol-induced injury of the human gastric mucosa by sucralfate but not cimetidine demonstrates that effective protection of the gastric mucosa can be achieved without neutralization or inhibition of gastric acid secretion and points out another clinical application for sucralfate.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Clinical efficacy of sucralfate in reflux esophagitis. Comparison with cimetidine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sucralfate has been evaluated in reflux esophagitis, based on its protective adherence to denuded surfaces, its bile salt-binding properties, and its cytoprotective properties. Histamine (H2)-receptor blockers are currently considered the standard therapy. The goal of this study was to compare the potential efficacy of sucralfate with that of cimetidine. A single-blind, randomized, multicenter study was performed in 42 patients with endoscopically documented reflux esophagitis. Patients were randomly given 1 g of sucralfate suspension four times daily or 400 mg of cimetidine four times daily for eight weeks. Forty patients were evaluated after eight weeks. Symptomatic improvement was good and comparable in both groups. In two patients given sucralfate and one given cimetidine, side effects were noted but did not necessitate withdrawal from the study. Endoscopy showed improvement in 53 percent of patients and healing of esophagitis in 31 percent after sucralfate treatment. With cimetidine, improvement was seen in 67 percent and healing occurred in 14 percent. In one patient receiving cimetidine, distal esophageal stenosis developed, requiring dilatation therapy. It is concluded that treatment with sucralfate improves the symptomatology and severity of reflux esophagitis. The results obtained with sucralfate appear comparable to those with cimetidine. Sucralfate may therefore be considered as a valid alternative to H2-receptor antagonist therapy in treating reflux esophagitis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of potential cytoprotective action of sucralfate and cimetidine. Studies with experimental feline esophagitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The potential mucosal protective effects of a liquid sucralfate preparation and the histamine (H2)-antagonist cimetidine on acid-induced esophagitis were studied. Esophagitis was induced in adult cats using a constant infusion of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid at 1 ml/minute for 20 minutes. Mucosal lesions were evaluated by blinded investigators using both fiber-optic endoscopy and light microscopy. Histology was scored for basal cell hyperplasia, intraepithelial leukocytosis, and subepithelial leukocytosis. Liquid sucralfate given prior to acid infusion consistently prevented acid-induced lesions, demonstrated by quantitative histologic scoring. Although cimetidine did not show the same degree of protection as sucralfate, the results did show a trend towards a cytoprotective effect.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of concurrent sucralfate administration on pharmacokinetics of naproxen.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sucralfate has been reported to protect the gastroduodenal mucosa against a variety of agents and is known to adsorb bile salts. Since gastrointestinal side effects can seriously compromise the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, and since it seems reasonable to assume that sucralfate may adsorb nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the influence of sucralfate on the pharmacokinetic parameters of naproxen was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers. To do so, the pharmacokinetic profile of naproxen, administered alone or with sucralfate, singly or repeatedly (twice daily for five days), was compared. No significant difference was observed with any pharmacokinetic parameter between the single administration of naproxen alone or with sucralfate. However, a significantly lower maximum plasma concentration was attained with the repeated administration of naproxen in combination with sucralfate, compared with the repeated administration of naproxen alone. When single- and multiple-dose administration were compared, significant differences were observed in the maximum plasma concentration and the cumulative area under the curve. These results suggest an accumulation of naproxen after five days' administration. This accumulation, however, is not altered by the administration of sucralfate. The results of this study suggest that when naproxen is administered with sucralfate, only a delay in naproxen's absorption may occur, confirmed by a lower maximum plasma concentration, a longer time to reach the maximum plasma concentration, a similar elimination half-life, and equivalence in bioavailability. The clinical importance of such a delay has yet to be proved; however, it is unlikely that the clinical efficacy of naproxen will be altered, since the amount of drug absorbed remains the same.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Protective effect of sucralfate against aspirin-induced damage to the human gastric mucosa.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sucralfate, an agent that heals peptic ulcers in humans, has been shown to reduce aspirin-induced gastric mucosal damage in experimental animals. It has been suggested that the protective effect of sucralfate is due to stimulation of local prostaglandin production. The purpose of this study was to establish whether sucralfate was capable of reducing aspirin-induced gastric damage in humans. The effect of 1 g of sucralfate or identical placebo was studied in random order in eight healthy subjects. To determine if the effect of sucralfate was related to local prostaglandin synthesis, a second series of studies was performed in which prostaglandin production was inhibited with indomethacin 50 mg given orally eight hours before sucralfate. In each subject, all studies were performed at least one week apart. Following an overnight fast, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, with sucralfate or placebo given orally 30 minutes before ingestion of 1,200 mg of soluble aspirin in 50 ml of water. Both endoscopist and subject were unaware of the test agent. Ninety minutes after aspirin ingestion, endoscopy was again performed and gastric mucosal lesions were counted and graded to derive an erosion score. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Aspirin produced endoscopic changes (score of 2.75 +/- 0.49) that were significantly (p less than 0.05) inhibited by sucralfate (score of 1.13 +/- 0.44). The protective effect of sucralfate was abolished by pretreatment with indomethacin (scores of 2.88 +/- 0.55 and 1.88 +/- 0.40, respectively). These results demonstrate that sucralfate significantly protects the human gastric mucosa against the acute damaging effects of aspirin. This effect is abolished by indomethacin, suggesting that the protective action of sucralfate on the gastric mucosa of humans may be related to stimulation of endogenous prostaglandins.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Role of maintenance sucralfate in prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fifty-nine patients who had duodenal ulcers that were healed following sucralfate administration in a dose of 1 g four times a day were randomly entered into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-month maintenance study to determine whether sucralfate 1 g twice daily prevents recurrence of duodenal ulceration. Patients were assessed endoscopically at four, eight, and 12 months after healing or earlier if clinical relapse occurred. Of the original 59 patients, 53 showed healing with six weeks of therapy, and the remaining six patients required 10 weeks of treatment. Nine patients were subsequently lost to follow-up because of non-compliance, leaving 50 patients for the analysis, 24 who received sucralfate and 26 who received placebo. There were 10 ulcer recurrences in the sucralfate group and the ulcers in 14 (58 percent) patients remaining healed at the end of 12 months. In contrast, there were 21 recurrences in the placebo group with the ulcers in five patients (19 percent) remaining healed at 12 months. Patients who received placebo experienced recurrence more quickly than those who received sucralfate and there was no difference between the two groups in terms of symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrence. There was no alteration in serum aluminium and phosphate levels throughout the study. Smoking seemed to have no adverse effect on recurrence once initial healing had been achieved. Sucralfate is, therefore, an effective and safe maintenance treatment for duodenal ulcer disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prevention of release of granulocyte aggregants into sheep lung lymph following endotoxemia by N-acetylcysteine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Interactions of granulocytes with the lungs are altered by endotoxemia and may be critical in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced lung injury. In chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep, we measured the ability of lung lymph to aggregate normal sheep neutrophils in vitro. We found a marked increase in lung lymph aggregating activity beginning within 1 hour after endotoxin infusion and persisting for several hours. When n-acetylcysteine was administered to the animals before endotoxin infusion, neutrophil aggregating activity in lung lymph after endotoxin infusion was markedly reduced. N-acetylcysteine did not affect neutrophil aggregation, adherence, or leukotriene B4 production in vitro and did not prevent complement activation at concentrations achieved in vivo. It is concluded that endotoxemia causes release from the lungs of substance(s) that activate granulocytes, and that this response is prevented by n-acetylcysteine, possibly as a result of the antioxidant properties of the drug.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reversible acute decrease in renal function by NSAIDs in cirrhosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of sulindac were compared with those of ibuprofen or naproxen on creatinine clearance and urinary prostanoids in patients with severe alcoholic cirrhosis. Sulindac caused acute declines in all renal parameters in four of five patients. The effect occurred with serum concentrations of the active sulfide metabolite comparable to those in patients with no hepatic impairment. The patient who was not affected had less effects on urinary PGE2 and TxB2 and no effect on 6-keto PGF1 alpha. In this patient, dosing with ibuprofen caused pronounced declines in all urinary prostanoids and a decrease in creatinine clearance. Two other patients treated with ibuprofen and one treated with naproxen also suffered decrements in all parameters. In conclusion, sulindac had suppressant effects on renal prostanoids associated with declines in creatinine clearance in these patients with cirrhosis, indicating a need for similar cautions with its use as with other NSAIDs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prolonged volume depletion imitating end-stage renal failure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four patients with chronic renal insufficiency were erroneously diagnosed as reaching the "end stage" of their disease. All of them had had insidious salt and water depletion prolonged over a period of 5 to 8 weeks. The correct diagnosis was missed because the signs and symptoms of slowly developing volume depletion were indistinguishable from the clinical picture of terminal uremia. Correction of the salt and water depletion was followed by marked clinical improvement and return of renal function to baseline values. Postural hypotension and hyponatremia are important clues for the diagnosis of insidiously developing mild or moderate volume depletion super-imposed on chronic renal insufficiency.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of serum from oral contraceptive users on the metabolism of low density lipoprotein.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The metabolism of radiolabeled 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) was studied in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) to investigate potential mechanisms contributing to heart attack and stroke in young women taking oral contraceptive (OC) preparations. No consistent difference was discerned in the capacity of these cells to bind and internalize LDL following 24-hour exposure to pooled lipoprotein-poor (d greater than 1.25 gm/ml) serum from nonsmoking OC users and controls. However, significantly (p greater than 0.01) less soluble radioactive material was released into the media from dishes containing SMC incubated with OC serum, indicating that their capacity to degrade LDL was impaired. Increased amounts of both cholesterol and cholesterol ester and electron microscopic evidence of lipid accumulation were found in SMC grown for 12 days under standard culture conditions with 10% OC serum. This combination of in vitro findings suggests that OC use may accelerate the development of cardiovascular disease in some women by modifying the metabolism of LDL by cells of the arterial wall.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metabolism in human endomyocardial biopsies and cardiac work.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The activities of the Krebs cycle (KC), glycolytic pathway (GP), and the hexose monophosphate shunt were studied in endomyocardial biopsies obtained from 25 patients and were related to left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI). Unexpectedly, KC activity was greater in patients with a reduced LVSWI than in those with a normal or elevated LVSWI. When the cardiac work:KC ratio, defined as LVSWI divided by KC activity, was plotted against LVSWI, the correlation coefficient was 0.86. Cardiac work did not correlate with other metabolic pathways measured. Patients with a reduced LVSWI generated less cardiac work per unit of KC activity than those who had a normal or elevated LVSWI. These data indicate that a reduction in LVSWI below 40 gram-meters/square meter (gm-m/m2) may be associated with either inefficient energy production, inefficient energy utilization, or both.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Seven patients developed clinical features simulating myocardial ischemia less than 72 hours after 12 of 13 separate intravenous 5-fluorouracil administrations; 9 episodes were associated with chest pain, 3 with hypotension, 3 with ventricular tachycardia and 1 with cardiogenic shock. Left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated by echocardiography in 5 separate episodes, 2 with interval improvement upon repeat echocardiograms. Pretreatment with nitrates and/or calcium channel blockers failed to prevent recurrence of cardiotoxicity during 5 of 6 repeat 5-fluorouracil administrations. Therapy with 5-fluorouracil is associated with cardiotoxicity simulating myocardial ischemia with left ventricular dysfunction. Pretreatment with coronary vasodilators may not prevent this phenomenon.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The close relationship of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with other lymphoproliferative disorders is a poorly understood, but well documented, phenomenon. A case is presented of a 68-year-old woman with the classical form of cutaneous KS in whom disappearance of the lesions after treatment was shortly followed by the development of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, pursuing a fulminant course to death. Postmortem examination revealed diffuse involvement of the marrow, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes by the immunoblastic proliferation. The close association of these two conditions may represent more than a chance occurrence. The appearance of a constellation of nonspecific symptoms suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder in debilitated patients with KS should alert the physician to the possibility of the development of this rare complication.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Vaso-occlusive crisis-associated neutrophil dysfunction in patients with sickle-cell disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) aggregation and chemotaxis were studied in 27 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Pain-free patients with SCD had a significantly impaired aggregation response to stimulation with n-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) with or without cytochalasin B (CB), compared with normal volunteers (p less than 0.001). Patients with SCD in vaso-occlusive crisis had PMN aggregation induced by FMLP with or without CB that was significantly increased compared with the cohort of pain-free SCD patients (p less than 0.001). PMN from pain-free patients had normal chemotaxis, whereas patients in vaso-occlusive crisis had a significant impairment in PMN chemotaxis. PMN chemotaxis was inversely related to the PMN aggregation response to FMLP with CB (r = -0.75). Thus, the PMN from pain-free patients with SCD appears to have normal or decreased "stickiness" and to develop increased stickiness during vaso-occlusive crisis. The mechanisms responsible for these changes need further elucidation. Alterations in PMN function may be responsible, in part, for the increased risk of infection noted in individuals with SCD and may play a role in the development of the acute chest syndrome.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A 65-year-old man manifested certain features of scleroderma several years before discovery of malignant thymoma. Following tumor resection, the signs and symptoms of scleroderma did not improve, and the patient experienced the abrupt onset of renal failure with malignant hypertension 7 months after the operation. The scleroderma renal crisis caused terminal renal failure, which was treated by chronic hemodialysis. This is the second reported case of thymoma associated with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). The authors suggest that thymoma and various immunologic disorders have a common etiologic factor which has not yet been found. This case emphasizes that thymectomy frequently has little effect on the course of the immunologic disease. The implications of the association of thymoma and PSS are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

- We examined the contact lens care systems of 100 asymptomatic patients who used hard or soft contact lenses for correction of refractive errors for the presence of bacteria, fungi, Acanthamoeba, and endotoxin. Of 100 patients, 52 had contaminated contact lens care systems. Sixteen of 126 bottles (13%) of commercial contact lens care solutions were contaminated. Contaminated commercial solutions were opened and used for a longer period of time than uncontaminated solutions. Contamination was not found in bottles of preserved commercial solutions that were opened and used for less than 21 days. All 12 bottles of homemade saline were contaminated with bacteria, and Acanthamoeba was isolated from two of these bottles. Pseudomonas was found in the care systems of 12 patients. Bacillus species, which form spores resistant to heat, were found in the care systems of seven patients. Endotoxin, which is also resistant to heat, was detected in nine of 35 care systems (26%) tested. Potential pathogens were isolated from the conjunctiva of six patients.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We followed up 32 eyes of 32 patients with early glaucoma (22 with capsular glaucoma and ten with simple glaucoma) who received laser trabeculoplasty as a primary therapy. These eyes were compared with a matched control group of 32 eyes treated with medication initially. The success rate (intraocular pressure below 22 mm Hg with laser alone or medication alone) at five years was 50% (16 of 32 eyes) in the laser-treated group and 22% (seven of 32 eyes) in the control group (P less than .02). The control group required more modifications of their therapy to control intraocular pressure. The neuroretinal rim area in the control eyes decreased 2.5 times as much as in the laser group (P = .017). Changes in the Friedmann visual fields did not differ significantly between the two groups.</ABSTRACT>

We then retrospectively compared the results to a similar group of 14 patients on whom a duration of 0.1 second was used. Power was titrated to achieve blanching or small bubble formation. All the other treatment variables were kept constant. Before treatment, the two groups did not differ in mean age, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, or number of drugs. After treatment, there was a 7 to 8 mm Hg decrease in intraocular pressure for both groups over a two-year follow-up period. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed for intraocular pressure, visual acuity, or drug score at the various follow-up periods. No patient required subsequent filtering surgery.</ABSTRACT>

Two cylindrical test chambers with optical paths of 17 mm and 23 mm were constructed to simulate the effect of vitreous hemorrhage in phakic and aphakic eyes. The visual acuity was measured in two subjects in a double-masked fashion for 17 dilutions of whole blood between 1/100 and 1/12,800. The visual acuity decreased approximately linearly between the 1/800 and 1/4,800 dilutions of blood. The visual acuity was 20/20 in all dilutions of blood higher than 1/4,800. The visual acuity was reduced to hand motions or worse with 12.5 microliter of blood in the 5-ml test chamber under all test conditions. The visual acuity was 20/20 in all tests with 1.04 microliter of blood in the test chamber. The visual acuity decreased from 20/20 to hand motions with only a twelve-fold change in concentration of blood in the test chamber.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Visual recovery in combined central retinal artery and central retinal vein occlusion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We observed two patients who had combined central retinal artery occlusion and central retinal vein occlusion with severely reduced visual acuity and characteristic retinal changes. Over the course of several months, visual acuity and ophthalmoscopic appearance returned to normal. Both patients had a transient visual loss before their occlusive events and a mild nonconcurrent central retinal vein occlusion in their fellow eye. There was no evidence of inflammatory, vascular, or myeloproliferative disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Retinal detachment after choroidal ischemia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Injection of a 15-micron microsphere suspension through one or two vortex veins of nine monkey eyes caused various degrees of sectorial choroidal ischemia, which were documented by fluorescein angiography and electron microscopy. The severity of the lesions to the fundus depended on the volume of microspheres injected (0.4 to 1.6 ml of a suspension of 600,000 microspheres/ml). Three hours after embolization white patches appeared in the retinal pigment epithelium as well as a posterior pole serous retinal detachment in five eyes. Delayed choroidal filling was noted in the quadrant involved, but a few choriocapillaris units slowly perfused, leading to fluorescein leakage in the serous retinal detachments. Histologic examination showed various types of damage to the retinal pigment epithelium, including vacuolization and cell membrane rupture.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Nd:YAG laser photodisruption of the lens nucleus before phacoemulsification.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied the use of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser pulses to soften sclerotic lens nuclei before phacoemulsification. We obtained 105 lens nuclei from extracapsular cataract extractions, graded them for degree of sclerosis, and randomized them into laser treatment (53 lenses) or control groups (52 lenses). The treated lenses received laser pulses until confluent pits and clefts were visible. All lenses were phacoemulsified and the times recorded. Nd:YAG laser pretreatment decreased phacoemulsification time in all grades. In moderately sclerotic nuclei, average phacoemulsification time was reduced from 40.1 to 23.9 seconds (40.4%). The nuclei of ten lenses obtained from intracapsular cataract extractions were treated intracapsularly, and the posterior capsule was inadvertently ruptured in five.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Compensatory mechanisms in congenital nystagmus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Congenital nystagmus may occur in a manifest or latent form. Since most patients with latent nystagmus also have nystagmus with both eyes open (manifest latent nystagmus), differentiation between these two entities frequently requires electronystagmographic wave form analysis. Such analysis shows distinctive characteristics for manifest and latent or manifest latent congenital nystagmus, suggesting different origins. Several compensation mechanisms exist by which congenital nystagmus is decreased and visual acuity improved. For manifest nystagmus, these mechanisms include version or convergence innervation or a rest point between primary position and maximal lateroversion. In latent or manifest latent nystagmus, the nystagmus decreases when the fixating eye is adducted. Patients with manifest congenital nystagmus may use several of these compensation strategies. Because of the difficulties involved in distinguishing between manifest and manifest latent nystagmus without electronystagmography, confusion has arisen regarding the etiologic relationship between congenital nystagmus and infantile esotropia. Such relationship clearly exists in some patients with manifest nystagmus and convergence dampening. However, in most patients with infantile esotropia and congenital nystagmus, the nystagmus is latent or manifest latent and there is no evidence of a causal relationship between these two entities.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Incidence of subcortical lesions not increased in nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy on magnetic resonance imaging.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We performed magnetic resonance imaging on nine patients with nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy and 11 control patients with sensorineural hearing loss and suspected acoustic neuroma. We then counted the number of subcortical lesions in each patient, which may represent an index of generalized cerebral vascular disease. Although patients in the ischemic optic neuropathy group had an average of 3.2 subcortical lesions and those in the control group had an average of 0.9 lesions, this difference was not significant. Based on the presence of subcortical lesions, patients with nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy do not appear to have an increased incidence of generalized cerebral vascular disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intracranial oculomotor nerve paresis with anisocoria and pupillary parasympathetic hypersensitivity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three patients developed anisocoria as a result of third nerve palsies caused by intracranial lesions: two in the cavernous sinus and one in the mesencephalon. Pharmacologic testing using low concentration pilocarpine showed apparent preganglionic parasympathetic supersensitivity of the abnormal pupil. These findings are compatible with the existence of a proposed direct pathway from the midbrain to the eye, without synapse at the ciliary ganglion. Cholinergic hypersensitivity can occur, not only with postciliary ganglionic but also with preciliary ganglionic parasympathetic lesions.</ABSTRACT>

All patients with cystinosis had the pathognomonic anterior segment findings of crystal deposition within conjunctiva and cornea. Transcutaneous stimulation of the supraorbital nerve and surface electromyographic recording of the orbicularis oculi muscle performed on four patients showed a normal afferent limb to the blink reflex. The corneal sensitivity in patients with cystinosis was 3.18 g/mm2; in the control subjects it was 0.43 g/mm2. This difference was statistically significant (P less than .001).</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Coexpression of keratin and vimentin in damaged and regenerating tubular epithelia of the kidney.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Most renal cell carcinomas coexpress vimentin and keratin, while renal tubular epithelia express only keratin. Investigation of the intermediate filament composition of tubular epithelia in diseased rat and human kidneys now shows that altered tubular epithelia unequivocally coexpress keratin and vimentin. In rats, pronounced coexpression of vimentin and keratin was observed in chronic nephrosis induced by daunomycin, and the extent of coexpression seemed to increase with the incidence of altered collapsed and cystically dilated tubules and with the degree of tubular epithelial proliferation. It was also seen during tubular regeneration after acute tubulotoxic injury induced by mercury chloride poisoning, with vimentin expression being lost in fully regenerated tubular epithelium. In man, expression was seen in chronically and irreversibly damaged kidneys. Thus, vimentin can be expressed temporarily in acutely and reversibly damaged kidneys and chronically in irreversibly damaged kidneys. Vimentin could perhaps be regarded as an indicator of the regenerating and proliferating activity of tubular lesions.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Transmural progression of morphologic changes during ischemic contracture and reperfusion in the normal and hypertrophied rat heart.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to compare the functional and morphologic changes that occur during ischemic contracture and reperfusion in the normal and hypertrophied heart. Hearts from Sprague-Dawley, spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats were evaluated using a modified Langendorff perfusion apparatus. After obtaining control data, hearts were potassium-arrested, made ischemic, and studied at various time points. Regional coronary flow was assessed with the use of radiolabeled microspheres or Microfil dye infusion, and morphologic changes were evaluated by means of light and electron microscopy. Sarcomere length changes and qualitative morphologic changes during global ischemia demonstrate a transmural progression of ischemic damage starting at the endocardium and extending, with time, epicardially. The progression of ischemic changes in hypertrophied hearts of SHRs was similar to that of normal hearts; however, hypertrophied hearts developed ischemic contracture sooner than normal hearts. In addition, the development of contraction band change after ischemic contracture occurred only when hearts were reperfused and was related to the development of no-reflow.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Formation of mast-cell colonies in methylcellulose by mouse skin cells and development of mucosal-like mast cells from the cloned cells in the gastric mucosa of W/Wv mice.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Connective tissue-type mast cells, other than those located in the serosal cavity, are fixed in the tissues. For study of the differentiation processes of mast cells in connective tissue, an in vitro method for producing mast-cell colonies is required. The authors enzymatically dispersed the cells from the skin of either neonatal or adult mice and plated them in methylcellulose containing pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned medium (PWM-SCM). More than 97% of the colonies that developed consisted of mast cells alone. The clonal nature of the mast-cell colonies was determined by using the giant granules of C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ mice as a marker: even when a mixture of skin cells from C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ and C57BL/6-+/+ mice was plated, most of the resulting colonies consisted of either bgJ/bgJ-type mast cells alone or +/+-type mast cells alone. In spite of depletion of T-cell-derived factors, concentrations of mast cells and mast cell colony-forming units (CFU-Mast) in the skin of nude athymic mice are normal. However, PWM-SCM was necessary for in vitro development of mast-cell colonies from the skin of nude mice. The concentration of CFU-Mast in the skin of genetically mast-cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice was negligible when compared with the value observed in the skin of control WBB6F1-+/+ mice. Individual mast-cell colonies derived from the skin of neonatal WBB6F1-+/+ mice were lifted from the methylcellulose, and cells from each colony were injected into the wall of the glandular stomach and the skin of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice. Most of the mast cell that appeared at the skin injection sites of the WBB6F1-W/Wv mice stained with berberine sulfate, indicating that they contained heparin. In contrast, the mast cells that appeared in the stomach mucosa of the recipient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice did not stain. This suggests that CFU-Mast located in the skin have not been committed to the connective tissue type. The present method may be useful for investigation of the mechanisms of mast-cell differentiation in connective tissue other than the serosal cavity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Immunohistochemical localization of metallothionein in human thyroid tumors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- High levels of metallothionein (MT) are present in the developing mammalian liver; however, a remarkable decrease is observed during postnatal life after weaning. This developmental profile is similar to that of certain oncofetal gene products such as alpha-fetoprotein, which is used as a tumor marker. This study deals with the reexpression of MT genes in thyroid tumors. With an immunohistochemical method, the presence of MT was investigated in tissue sections of normal and neoplastic human thyroid glands. Tissue sections of 34 thyroid tumors and 10 normal human thyroid glands were studied by means of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. MT was localized in 31 of the thyroid gland tumors. MT was also present in two of the normal thyroid glands. These findings indicate that although high levels of MT are mainly found in the fetal liver, it may also be expressed actively in certain human thyroid neoplastic tissues, and occasionally in normal thyroid tissue.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Possible roles of tumor necrosis factor in the pathology of malaria.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors have earlier proposed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) might contribute to the pathology of malaria. Here they report the outcome of injecting recombinant human TNF/cachectin into normal mice and others with low parasitemias (6-35%) of Plasmodium vinckei. The object was to see how precisely the pathologic features of the terminal stages of this infection could be produced, when parasitemias are 70-80%. Hypoglycemia, mid-zonal liver damage, and pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils in the pulmonary vasculature, all of which are seen in severe P vinckei infection, occurred within 4-12 hours after the mildly infected mice received TNF/cachectin. Uninfected mice were much less susceptible. TNF/cachectin also increases plasma lactate, a change seen in both the human and rodent diseases. From these findings and the recent literature on TNF/cachectin, including its detection in serum from malarial patients, it seems likely that excessive release of this monokine could account for certain of the unexplained pathologic features of human malaria.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Iprindole reverses the lamellar body deficiency of cultured L-2 cells. Possible implications in the reversal of surfactant deficiency.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Type II alveolar epithelial cells in long-term culture typically lose the ability to synthesize surfactant together with a loss of the characteristic lamellar bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells. Iprindole, a cationic amphiphilic drug, induces lamellar body formation in cultured L-2 cells, a cell line derived from rat Type II cells, but devoid of lamellar bodies. With concentrations of 10(-7)-10(-5) M iprindole, which approximate therapeutic plasma concentrations in human subjects, the drug induced the formation of lamellar bodies within 8 hours of incubation. This effect on cell morphology was rapidly lost after withdrawal of the drug. At concentrations of iprindole which induced lamellar body formation, there was a significant increase in phospholipid content of the L-2 cells as well as an increase in disaturated phosphatidylcholine, an important constituent of surfactant. These studies suggest that the use of drugs such as iprindole may represent a novel approach in the augmentation of phospholipid (and possibly surfactant) content of Type II cells in the lung.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Activation of C5 by cobra venom factor is required in neutrophil-mediated lung injury in the rat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cobra venom factor (CVF)-induced systemic activation of the complement system in the rat has been shown to result in the development of acute lung microvascular injury and appearance in lungs and plasma of lipid peroxidation products. The pathogenesis of these events is dependent on complement and neutrophils and is sensitive to pretreatment of experimental animals with iron chelators or scavengers of hydroxyl radical. In order to further analyze the role of complement in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in rats after systemic complement activation, two different CVFs have been employed in the present study. One was the previously used CVFn isolated from Naja n. naja venom, whereas the other factor, CVFh, was isolated from Naja h. haje venom. Both factors have been shown to activate the alternative complement pathway by forming a potent C3 convertase but differ with respect to their ability to bind and activate C5. CVFn but not CVFh activates C5 and distant complement components. When equal doses of C3-activating activity of CVFn or CVFh were injected intravenously into rats, CVFh-treated rats failed to develop acute lung injury, whereas CVFn-treated animals showed pronounced increases in lung vascular permeability. Similarly, in isolated blood perfused rat lungs neither the lung injury nor pulmonary hypertension caused by CVFn were found after injection of CVFh. In addition, CVFh-treated animals failed to show transient neutropenia or appearance in plasma of C5-derived chemotactic activity, although the extent of C3 conversion in vivo was identical to that seen in CVFn-treated rats. Morphologic examination of the lungs of the experimental animals revealed no signs of injury in CVFh-treated rats, whereas the lungs from CVFn-treated animals revealed interstitial and alveolar edema, as well as plugging of pulmonary capillaries with neutrophils, blebbing and/or destruction of vascular endothelial cells, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. These studies provide evidence that activation of the complement system involving C3 but not extending further in the complement sequence is not sufficient to bring about acute injury of the lung microvasculature and that the activation sequence must at least also involve C5.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The pathophysiology of protein-overload proteinuria.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Alterations in glomerular function and structure were studied in protein-overload nephrosis in the rat induced by intraperitoneal administration of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Fractional clearance (C/GFR) studies using inulin and tracer proteins of different molecular size and charge revealed in proteinuric rats 1) unchanged glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow; 2) a 34-fold increase in C/GFR of rat serum albumin, reaching values similar to BSA; 3) a 2-fold increase in C/GFR for anionic horse radish peroxidase (HRP), but normal values for neutral and cationic HRP, and 4) an 11- and 3-fold increase for heterologous IgG and IgM, respectively. Glomerular epithelial cells showed degenerative changes, but the distribution of anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane was found to be unaltered, as determined by polyethyleneimine binding studies. In summary, an elevation of serum albumin concentration resulted in an increased transcapillary albumin transport. This was found to lead to degenerative changes of glomerular epithelial cells with development of large pore defects, which were completely reversible.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The third component of complement is transcribed and secreted by cultured human endothelial cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Monotypic cultures of passaged human umbilical vein endothelial cells secrete C3 protein, which is specifically immunoprecipitable from cell lysates and conditioned medium. A transcript migrating at 5.3 kilobases hybridizes with a mouse-derived C3 DNA probe in parallel cultures of endothelial cells, hepatoma cells (HepG2), and freshly isolated human monocytes. Steady-state transcript levels were as follows: HepG2 cells, 1.0; monocytes, 0.05; endothelial cells, 0.01. These data suggest that C3, an indispensible component for activation of complement by both the classical and alternative pathways, is locally synthesized in the vascular bed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Familial schizophrenia and treatment response.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-nine patients with chronic schizophrenia for whom hospitalization was clinically indicated received haloperidol for 4 to 6 weeks in a standardized dose schedule. Responders were compared with nonresponders for family history, baseline symptom factors, and ventricle-brain ratio (VBR). The lifetime risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders was higher among first-degree relatives of nonresponders than among first-degree relatives of responders. Treatment responders had higher baseline scores on the factors of activation and hostile-suspiciousness, but the groups did not differ in any other baseline symptom factor or in VBR. The authors suggest that there is an association between failure to respond to drugs and genetic loading for schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The authors studied the relationship between lateral cerebral ventricular size and regional cerebral blood flow during mental activation in 30 patients with schizophrenia. Patients with large ventricles had diffusely lower cortical gray matter blood flow than patients with small ventricles. In addition, an inverse correlation between ventricular size and prefrontal blood flow was observed while patients were attempting to solve a neuropsychological test specifically related to the prefrontal cortex. These data suggest that structural brain pathology impairs prefrontal physiology in schizophrenia, implicating a neural mechanism for the intellectual deficits characteristic of this disorder.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sustained remission in drug-free schizophrenic patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The inability to determine which schizophrenic patients do not require maintenance medication is a significant gap in current knowledge. This report describes 23 largely chronic DSM-III schizophrenic patients who, after a period of inpatient treatment, sustained good outcome without maintenance antipsychotic medication over an average of 15 years. Retrospective study of these patients revealed that their distinguishing characteristics at admission included better premorbid social and occupational adjustment, higher levels of accrued psychosocial competence and acquired skills, fewer hebephrenic traits, and the preservation of affect (depressed mood). Hence, even within a largely chronic patient sample, classic predictors of good outcome may also be useful in predicting sustained remission without medication.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was measured in the CSF of 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 15 age-matched control subjects, and 20 older depressed subjects. Patients with dementia or depression were found to have lower CSF somatostatin concentrations than control subjects despite markedly different clinical presentations. Severity of depression was clearly different in all three groups but showed no significant correlation with CSF concentration of somatostatin. There was a significant positive correlation between CSF somatostatin-like immunoreactivity and cognitive functioning in all 47 subjects, but this association was not statistically significant within individual diagnostic groups. These data raise interesting questions about possible biological links between Alzheimer's disease and depression in older patients.</ABSTRACT>

The mean basal cortisol level of the patients with panic disorder was significantly higher than that of the normal control subjects but almost identical to that of the depressed patients. Only three of the patients with panic disorder had abnormal DST results. These results indicate that patients with panic disorder have an abnormality of at least one function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system which overlaps the abnormality in major depressive disorder.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Psychiatrists in Australia were asked to recommend treatments for several anxiety and somatoform disorders. In previous surveys they had agreed about the preferred treatments for schizophrenia and major affective disorder but not about treatments for "neurotic depression" or agoraphobia. In the present survey, no treatment was regarded as critical by a majority of psychiatrists for any of the five anxiety and somatoform disorders studied. The authors conclude that because neurotic disorders form an important part of the workload of psychiatrists, consensus procedures should be used to develop guidelines for treatment until the research literature can provide more adequate guidance.</ABSTRACT>

Limitation of SI units deemed suitable for use in reporting clinical laboratory results stems from recommendations put forth by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Limitations are: 1) the liter as sole recommended unit of volume in concentration measurement; 2) substance concentration (unit mole) favored over mass concentration (submultiples of the kilogram); and 3) discouraging the use of the prefixes hecto-, deca-, deci-, and centi-. Further discussion by the American Medical Association and other organizations is required before consensus in the US medical community can be reached as to extent of and time frame for conversion to SI for reporting clinical laboratory measurements.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Millions of children in developing countries are dying from diseases that could be prevented or treated by simple interventions. To examine ways to improve the delivery of these basic services, we evaluated well child clinics and mass vaccination campaigns under operational conditions in a rural area of Nicaragua. We found that mass vaccination campaigns using volunteers reached 77.1 per cent of the population under age six. At stationary well child clinics in which villages were invited to a health center and a small food ration was used as an incentive, attendance improved to 94.1 per cent. Similar attendance levels (99.2 per cent) were attained by mobile well child clinics also using a food incentive. Attendance at stationary clinics decreased with the distance of the village from the health center. However, stationary clinics took up only half as much health workers' time as mobile clinics. Our results suggest that stationary clinics employing food as an incentive could be used for villages or neighborhoods close to a health center while mobile clinics offering food should be reserved for more isolated villages.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A computer simulation model was developed to project the future mortality, morbidity, and cost of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the United States population. The model contains a demographic-epidemiologic (DE) submodel, which stimulates the distribution of coronary risk factors and the conditional incidence of CHD in a demographically evolving population; a "bridge" submodel, which determines the outcome of the initial CHD event; and a disease history (DH) submodel, which simulates subsequent events in persons with a previous CHD event. The user of the model may simulate the effects of interventions, either preventive (i.e., risk factor modification) or therapeutic, upon mortality, morbidity, and cost for up to a 30-year period. If there were no future changes in risk factors or the efficacy of therapies after 1980, baseline projections indicate that the aging of the population, and especially the maturation of the post-World War II baby-boom generation, would increase CHD prevalence and annual incidence, mortality, and costs by about 40-50 per cent by the year 2010. Unprecedented reductions in risk factors would be required to offset these demographic effects on the absolute incidence of CHD. The specific forecasts could be inaccurate, however, as a consequence of erroneous assumptions or misestimated baseline data, and the model awaits validation based on actual future data.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Contraceptive needs and practices among women attending an inner-city STD clinic.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess the potential need, interest, and benefits of provision of contraceptive services in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, we surveyed 516 women attending an inner-city STD clinic regarding contraceptive and sexual practices, STD prevalence, knowledge of contraceptive-related STD prophylaxis, and interest in contraceptive services within the STD clinic setting. The study population was at high risk for unintended pregnancy and STDs; at time of interview 46 per cent of women were not contracepting and 59 per cent were treated for STD or STD exposure. Two-thirds of women had at least one prior pregnancy and 50 per cent had at least one living child. Only 26 per cent of women knew that some contraceptive methods may reduce the risk of STD acquisition; however, 62 per cent expressed interest in contraceptive methods which would reduce their risk of STD acquisition. This study suggests that provision of contraceptive services in STD clinic settings may address dual needs in a group at high risk for both unintended pregnancy and STD.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- An outbreak of watermelon-borne pesticide toxicity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The largest reported United States outbreak of illness caused by a foodborne pesticide was due to aldicarb-contaminated watermelons. In Oregon, where the first episodes of toxicity were reported, 264 reports were received, and 61 definite cases were identified. Residues of aldicarb, a cholinesterase inhibitor, were found in 10 of 16 tested melons which had been eaten by persons meeting the case definition. The outbreak demonstrates the need for enhanced physician vigilance with respect to anticholinesterase intoxication. It also demonstrates the value of an established system for reporting of unusual illness to public health officials.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of tests used to distinguish smokers from nonsmokers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Questionnaire and biochemical measures of smoking were studied in 211 hospital outpatients. Eleven different tests of smoke intake were compared for their ability to categorize smokers and nonsmokers correctly. The concentration of cotinine, whether measured in plasma, saliva, or urine, was the best indicator of smoking, with sensitivity of 96-97 per cent and specificity of 99-100 per cent. Thiocyanate provided the poorest discrimination. Carbon monoxide measured as blood carboxyhaemoglobin or in expired air gave sensitivity and specificity of about 90 per cent. Sensitivities of the tests were little affected by the presence among the claimed nonsmokers of a group of 21 "deceivers" who concealed their smoking. It is concluded that cotinine is the measure of choice, but for most clinical applications carbon monoxide provides an acceptable degree of discrimination and is considerably cheaper and simpler to apply.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The epidemiology and spectrum of surgical care in district hospitals of Pakistan.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- On-site surveys of 19 district-level hospitals in Pakistan revealed that, in 1983, 23,839 procedures were performed. There were 98 different types of operations. Thirty-eight per cent were classified as General Surgery, 30 per cent Gynecology and Operative Obstetrics, 19 per cent Urology, and 13 per cent Orthopedics. In three regions, population-based data were obtained from the 12 hospitals which provided all surgical care to discrete populations. The overall rate of surgical operations per 100,000 population was 124, 1.5 per cent to 9 per cent of the rate in western countries. The ratio of surgeons per 100,000 population was 0.36, 1/80 the ratio in the United States. There were almost twice as many operations per surgeon as in the USA. These data indicate a severe shortage of surgeons in Pakistan's district hospitals. They also provide the spectrum and relative numbers of different operations performed at the district level. This information has been useful along with other factors in designing a surgical curriculum at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- We conducted a statewide, controlled trial of the efficacy of an educational visit in reducing antipsychotic drug prescribing for nursing home patients. Frequent antipsychotic drug prescribers were visited by a trained physician counselor who stressed known drug risks for elderly patients and suggested techniques for reducing antipsychotic drug use. Although well-received, the visit did not reduce antipsychotic drug prescribing. This negative finding suggests that future interventions address factors within the nursing home which encourage antipsychotic drug use.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The prevalence of ownership (7.5 per cent) and the accuracy of home sphygmomanometers were determined in a population-based survey in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Sixty-four per cent of home sphygmomanometers were accurate within +/- 2 mm Hg of a calibrating sphygmomanometer; another 26 per cent were within +/- 3-6 mm Hg. These results suggest that although many home sphygmomanometers are accurate, some are very inaccurate. Health care providers should advise regular calibration when home sphygmomanometers are used for therapeutic self-management of hypertension.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Freeze dried anterior cruciate ligament allografts. Preliminary studies in a goat model [published erratum appears in Am J Sports Med 1987 Sep-Oct;15(5):482]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One ACL in each of 11 mature goats was replaced with a freeze dried bone-ACL-bone allograft. One year following implantation the goats had their knees evaluated biomechanically and for microvascularity and histologic changes. The reconstructed knees had a significantly greater total AP laxity (3.8 +/- 0.6 mm) (mean and SEM) than the controls (1.0 +/- 0.1 mm). Differences in primary AP laxity were responsible for 81% of the difference in total laxity, with only a 0.4 mm difference in secondary laxity. Neutral stiffness in the reconstructive knee was 17% of control, while stiffness at 30 newtons (N) of anterior force was approximately 50% of controls. Ligament stiffness in the linear region for the ACL allograft was 35% of the control value of 686 N/mm. The maximum load of the allografts was 571 +/- 45 N, or 25% of the contralateral ACL control strength (2301 +/- 155 N). Five of the seven allografts failed at the femoral insertion. Both elongation (83%) and energy (21%) to maximum load were less for allografts than controls. Histologic evaluation of the allografts revealed the presence of a regular oriented dense connective tissue which resembled a normal ligament. Microangiography revealed a periligamentous and endoligamentous vascular pattern reminiscent of a normal ACL and complete revascularization of the bone plugs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A review of nonoperative treatment of Jones' fracture.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sir Robert Jones, in 1902, described a transverse fracture of the proximal diaphysis of the fifth metatarsal, which he treated conservatively with good results. Since that time, classification into acute and chronic categories by several authors has been proposed and most agree with the relatively high incidence of non-union. Controversy exists concerning operative versus nonoperative primary treatment especially in athletes. The purpose of this study was to determine if nonoperative treatment could be used effectively in treating these fractures. A retrospective study of nine patients with 10 Jones' fractures was completed. The cases were categorized as acute or chronic by clinical history and radiographic appearance. The average age was 23.6 years. There were eight males and one female. In this group, competitive athletes sustained chronic fractures, while acute fractures occurred in nonathletes. Treatment consisted of a short leg nonweightbearing cast until radiographic and clinical healing occurred, followed by 6 weeks of limited activity. Mean clinical and radiographic union of chronic fractures was 9.4 weeks; acute fractures, 22 weeks. All competitive athletes returned to their preinjury level of competition at an average of 12 weeks following initiation of treatment. There was one refracture. Our data indicate that nonoperative treatment of early chronic or subacute fractures without intramedullary sclerosis can compare favorably with surgical treatment procedures reported in other studies in returning athletes to play postinjury. We suggest serious consideration be given to the method herein as a form of primary treatment of the early chronic Jones' fracture without intramedullary sclerosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgical management of Achilles tendinitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Inflammation of the Achilles tendon and its contiguous structures is one of the most common overuse problems seen in runners. There are actually several etiologies. Involvement of the tendon itself is secondary to areas of mucinoid or fibrotic degeneration, or may be a result of a partial rupture. The sheath (or mesotenon) may also become chronically inflammed. Retrocalcaneal bursitis seems to be a separate entity with hypertrophy and fibrosis of the bursa usually occurring in conjunction with a prominent posterior superior angle of the os calcis. The vast majority of patients can be successfully treated nonoperatively; however, there is a group of patients who are refractory to nonoperative management who would like to continue running, particularly if they are competitive. A retrospective review of 45 surgical cases in 37 patients was performed. All but two of these patients were competitive long-distance runners. There were 24 cases of Achilles tendinitis and/or tenosynovitis, 14 cases with retrocalcaneal bursitis, and 7 with a combination of both. Mean followup was 3 years (range, 1 1/2 to 8 years). Overall there were 87% satisfactory results. Ninety-two percent of the patients with involvement with the tendon and/or sheath had a satisfactory outcome as compared with 71% of patients with retrocalcaneal bursitis. Passive dorsiflexion in the 29 unilateral cases improved from a mean of 17 degrees preoperatively to a mean of 25 degrees postoperatively. We feel that surgery offers a solution for highly motivated runners with chronic posterior heel pain who would like to continue running when conservative measures have failed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- High school football injuries: identifying the risk factors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This epidemiologic survey of the literature on the factors contributing to the high number of high school football injuries consolidates the current information on the characteristics and risk factors associated with these injuries. To reduce the incidence of knee sprains and strains, the most common injuries to this population, the following preventive recommendations are presented: 1) optimum maintenance of playing fields; 2) use of the soccer-style shoe; 3) noncontact and controlled activities in practice sessions; and 4) increased vigilance over technique during injury-prone preseason practices. The authors conclude that more research into factors such as exposure time and activity at injury will further reduce the risk to the high school football player.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The patient with symptomatic chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency. Results of minimal arthroscopic surgery and rehabilitation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Forty-nine patients with 51 chronic symptomatic anterior cruciate deficient knees were studied retrospectively by chart review and follow-up examination an average of 5.8 years postinjury and 1.5 years from arthroscopic evaluation, with or without arthroscopic surgery, and the institution of a conservative rehabilitation program. Subjective evaluation of function was obtained by questionnaire. At arthroscopy, meniscal lesions were seen in 37 of 51 knees, and degenerative changes were noted in 24 knees. The ACL was absent in 43 knees. Partial meniscectomy or suturing was performed on 20 patients. All patients had an average of 3 weeks of supervised physical therapy stressing hamstring strengthening. At followup, thigh girth measurements of injured and normal legs found thigh wasting in 40 patients. Seven of 33 patients radiographed showed evidence of degenerative changes. About two-thirds of the patients returned to some level of athletics and had no problems with activities of daily living. Twenty were able to return to pivoting sports, but only five could return to their preinjury levels of competition. Of the 18 patients who did not return to athletics, only 8 were considering or had had a ligament reconstruction. Those patients who chose to continue rehabilitation beyond the prescribed period and who modified their activities had a better functional outcome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Anterior cruciate reconstruction in the chronically unstable knee using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prosthetic ligament.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study is to review 30 patients with failed, multiply operated knees, or knees with gross instability which were reconstructed using the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prosthetic ligament as a substitute for the ACL. The results were then compared with our experience with the proplast ligament used in a previous clinical series. This prospective review evaluated the patients preoperatively and at regular intervals during the postoperative period. The average followup was 24 months postoperation. Eighty-three percent of the patients had a satisfactory result, scoring greater than 140 points on a 200 point knee grading scale. Objectively, the anterior instability pattern was improved in 87% of the knees. Subjectively, pain of at least a mild degree persisted in 70% of the patients postoperatively. This pain seemed to correlate with articular cartilage changes documented intraoperatively. Major complications occurred in two patients. In conclusion, the PTFE prosthetic ligament was an improvement over the proplast ligament in the reconstruction of the multiply operated, unstable knee. The 83% satisfactory rate with the PTFE was promising compared to a 52% satisfactory rate using the proplast ligament. However, we encourage future long term studies of the PTFE prosthetic ligament in the reconstruction of the ACL in the chronically unstable knee.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Infrapatellar contracture syndrome. An unrecognized cause of knee stiffness with patella entrapment and patella infera.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Infrapatellar Contracture Syndrome (IPCS) is an infrequently recognized cause of posttraumatic knee morbidity. Unique to this group of patients is the combination of restricted knee extension and flexion associated with patella entrapment. IPCS can occur primarily as an exaggerated pathologic fibrous hyperplasia of the anterior soft tissues of the knee beyond that associated with normal healing. It can also occur secondarily to prolonged immobility and lack of extension associated with knee surgery, particularly intraarticular ACL reconstruction. IPCS follows a predictable natural history which is divided into three stages. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and recommended treatment are determined by the stage at presentation. Once beyond its early presentation, IPCS is best treated by an anterior intraarticular and extraarticular capsular debridement and release, followed by extensive rehabilitation. The authors review 28 consecutive cases of IPCS. At followup 3 months to 4 years postoperation, the patients had averaged 2.3 additional surgical procedures following their index procedure or injury. The average increase in extension at followup was 12 degrees with the average increase flexion 35 degrees. Eighty percent of patients demonstrated signs and symptoms consistent with patellofemoral arthrosis; 16% of the patients demonstrated patella infera. The authors conclude that prevention or early detection and aggressive treatment are the only ways of avoiding complication in these problem cases.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lower extremity flexibility patterns in classical ballet dancers and their correlation to lateral hip and knee injuries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Knee and hip problems account for up to 40% of injuries in classical ballet. Despite apparent flexibility, many dancers appeared to have tight iliotibial bands that contributed to lower limb problems. Thirty senior female ballet dancers were contrasted with thirty age-matched active volunteers for hip and knee range of motion, and the information derived was correlated with their orthopaedic medical histories. Dancers spent a reasonable period of time warming up, but it was usually with an unbalanced routine that emphasized hip abduction and external rotation to the exclusion of adduction work. This was reflected in the significantly lower range of passive hip adduction and internal rotation compared to the controls. Furthermore, the older and more experienced the dancer, the more this trend was exaggerated. This unbalanced flexibility may play a role in the production of lateral knee pain (30% of the dancers) and anterior hip pain (33% of the dancers). It is suggested that more attention should be given to a balanced stretching regimen as part of the dancers' warmup in an effort to reduce the frequency of some of the chronic hip and knee complaints.</ABSTRACT>

- Groin injuries are becoming more common today in soccer. Conservative treatment consisting of rest, physiotherapy, and medication yields favorable results in only 38% of the long-standing lesions. Operative treatment is indicated in selected cases. Better knowledge of the underlying pathology and a more accurate initial conservative treatment directed to the ethiopathogenesis could solve many of the problems. However, in our experience a simple subcutaneous adductor tenotomy and/or a rectus abdominis tenotomy in combination with a fasciaplasty was done successfully in 75 of 81 patients. There was no loss of power in this group of patients as measured and compared with a control group.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Androgenic-anabolic steroid effects on serum thyroid, pituitary and steroid hormones in athletes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Endocrine responses in seven power athletes were investigated during a 12 week strength training period, when the athletes were taking high doses of androgenic-anabolic steroids, and during the 13 weeks following drug withdrawal. During the use of steroids significant decreases (P less than 0.05 to 0.001) in the serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, triidothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) were found, whereas the value of triidothyronine uptake increased (P less than 0.001). In relation to the changes in the thyroid function parameters measured, we suggest that the primary target of androgen action was TBG biosynthesis. In five of the seven subjects, serum concentrations of growth hormone increased at some point of the study 5 to 60-fold. Because of the use of exogenous testosterone, serum testosterone concentration tended to increase. This increase was associated with a corresponding increase (P less than 0.001) in serum estradiol. Furthermore, there were major decreases in serum LH (P less than 0.01) and FSH (P less than 0.01) concentrations, and testicular testosterone production was therefore decreased. This was characterized by a very low serum testosterone concentration (5.1 +/- 1.8 nmol/l) 4 weeks following drug withdrawal. Cessation of drug use resulted in return of all the variables measured to the initial values, except for serum testosterone, which was at a low level (14.6 +/- 8.8 nmol/l) 9 weeks after drug withdrawal, indicating prolonged impairment of testicular endocrine function. No consistent changes were found in the eight control athletes.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Eight patients with documented recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder sustained iatrogenic brachial plexus injuries during either Putti-Platt or Bristow procedures. Two patients also sustained axillary artery injuries. There were six males and two females. Postoperatively, complete paralysis of the musculocutaneous nerve was noted in six cases and incomplete paralysis in one case. Two patients had complete axillary nerve palsies. There were two cases of partial paralysis of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves, respectively. Seven of the patients underwent brachial plexus exploration an average of 16 weeks following their initial operation (range, 4 to 40). Suture material was removed from around or within two musculocutaneous nerves and one ulnar, one median, and one axillary nerve. Two lacerated musculocutaneous nerves were amenable to delayed primary repair. Two musculocutaneous, one median and one axillary nerve required grafting. Injury to the brachial plexus was associated with inadequate knowledge of regional anatomy, blind clamping of axillary artery lacerations, use of axillary incisions which limited exposure, and failure to identify the musculocutaneous nerve during Bristow procedures. If a brachial plexus injury occurs during a Putti-Platt or a Bristow procedure and the lesion does not rapidly, progressively, and completely recover, the brachial plexus should be explored since there is a high likelihood of structural neurologic injury.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Human visceral leishmaniasis: analysis of the specificity of humoral immune response to polypeptides of Leishmania donovani chagasi.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Soluble antigens from Leishmania donovani chagasi were studied in terms of their ability to react with sera from human visceral leishmaniasis. Thirty-six polypeptides, with molecular weights ranging from 14,400 to 123,000 were demonstrated by Western blot analysis. An extensive cross-reactivity with sera from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease also was observed. Two polypeptides (Mr 119,000 and 123,000) reacted with all the sera from visceral leishmaniasis patients. When they were electroeluted from gels and evaluated with respect to specificity to the L. donovani chagasi subspecies, these components were expressed in all strains of Leishmania tested, but not in those of Trypanosoma cruzi. These results indicated that these components are shared by Trypanosomatidae of genus Leishmania. The eluted polypeptides did not react with sera from patients with Chagas' disease, indicating the feasibility of using purified antigens to discriminate between the humoral immune responses in T. cruzi and Leishmania infections.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Epidemiology of Giardia lamblia infection in children: cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in urban and rural communities in Zimbabwe.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Stool specimens from 3,038 children in rural and urban areas near Harare were examined for Giardia lamblia cysts. Preliminary studies, using specimens collected on three consecutive days from 157 known cyst passers, showed that over 89% of infections could be diagnosed on single stool specimens by examination of Gomori-stained smears. The overall prevalence of giardial infection was 19.4% with significantly more urban children (21.1%) passing cysts than rural children (16.7%). In urban areas the highest prevalence was in young (5-6 year) children, while in rural areas, the highest prevalence was in older (9-10 year) children. Of 132 children treated with Entamizole a metronidazole-diloxanide combination, 127 (96.2%) had ceased excreting cysts by the fifth treatment day. Follow-up examination of these children showed a high rate of reinfection, with 29.6% excreting cysts during the year following treatment. During the same period 13.3% of previously uninfected children had started passing cysts, while over half of infected, but untreated, children had undergone apparent "self-cure." Younger children were more likely to be reinfected than older children, and continued excreting cysts for a longer period of time.</ABSTRACT>

- The isoenzyme patterns of 92 isolates of Entamoeba histolytica from British Columbia and 28 from Ontario were determined. Seropositivity for E. histolytica was assessed by indirect hemagglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the one center and by ELISA and amebic gel diffusion in the other. In both British Columbia and Ontario nonpathogenic zymodemes I and III were most common. A newly described isoenzyme pattern was identified in Ontario. Only 9 of 120 zymodeme patterns identified were found to be pathogenic strains of E. histolytica. Pathogenic isolates were strongly correlated with clinical symptoms and seropositivity.</ABSTRACT>

- The effect of schistosome infection on in vivo gluconeogenesis was studied in mice. Mice infected for 6 weeks displayed no nutritional pathology, regardless of nutritional treatment. All mice with patent infections (9 weeks) displayed decreased rates of growth and food consumption as well as significantly reduced gross conversion efficiencies. The glucogenic capacity, % pyruvate incorporated/g liver, was markedly reduced in infected fasted mice when compared with fasted controls. Total glucogenesis, % pyruvate incorporated/100 g body water, was the same in infected and control groups and the compensatory response in infected individuals was correlated with increased liver mass. The level of hepatic glycogen was significantly greater in infected fasted mice than in their unparasitized counterparts.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acquired resistance to Fasciola hepatica in cattle using a purified adult worm antigen.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Calves were immunized twice in 4 weeks with a Fasciola/Schistosoma cross-reactive, cross-protective defined immunity antigen (denoted FhSmIII(M)) isolated from F. hepatica adult worm extracts by antibody affinity chromatography and challenged 7 weeks later with F. hepatica metacercariae. Flukes were recovered at 16 weeks of infection at which time the immunized calves had 55% less F. hepatica than the controls. All of the immunized calves developed high antibody levels of FhSmIII(M), detectable in the ELISA, by 4 weeks after a single immunization. By 9 weeks of infection with F. hepatica the immunized calves had lower sorbitol dehydrogenase levels than the unimmunized, F. hepatica-infected control calves, indicating less liver damage in the vaccinated group. These studies demonstrate that subcellular F. hepatica macromolecules cross-reactive and cross-protective against S. mansoni also have the potential to serve as vaccines in cattle exposed to this parasitic disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Characterization of an Onchocerca-specific DNA clone from Onchocerca volvulus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A genomic library of a savanna isolate of Onchocerca volvulus was screened to detect recombinant plasmids containing highly repeated DNA sequences of this parasite. Four recombinant plasmids were identified which hybridized specifically to Onchocerca DNA, but not to DNA from humans, black flies, Brugia malayi, B. pahangi, or Wuchereria bancrofti. The recombinant plasmids had a low level of homology to Dirofilaria immitis. All recombinant plasmids contain related DNA sequences based on Southern hybridization analysis. Sequences related to these recombinant plasmids are present in different geographic isolates of O. volvulus and O. ochengi, an animal parasite. Two of the recombinant plasmids contain sequences also found in O. lienalis. One recombinant plasmid, puOvs3, has been characterized in detail, including DNA sequence determination. Radiolabeled puOvs3 is able to detect 100 pg of genomic DNA isolated from O. volvulus worms from both savanna and forest regions. It can differentiate O. volvulus from O. ochengi by Southern blot analysis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sexual transmission of dengue viruses by Aedes albopictus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Male Aedes albopictus experimentally infected with dengue virus types 1, 2, 3, or 4 transmitted their infection sexually to female Ae. albopictus. Such transmission was enhanced if the females had taken a bloodmeal 2 to 7 days prior to mating. Male Ae. albopictus also transmitted dengue virus vertically to their F1 progeny. Infected progeny were found among those derived from eggs laid greater than or equal to 73 hr after mating but not among those derived from eggs laid prior to that time. This suggests that virus probably was not transmitted directly to ova but, rather, underwent prior replication in the female genital tract. Female Ae. albopictus experimentally infected with dengue type 1 virus did not transmit their infection sexually to males. This finding supports the hypothesis that male mosquitoes naturally infected with dengue virus acquired their infection vertically.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reduced survival of adult Culex pipiens infected with Rift Valley fever virus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral infection on the survival of female Culex pipiens was examined. In 3 experiments in which mosquitoes ingested RVF virus, there was a 44% decrease in survival to days 14-16 for transmitting vs. nontransmitting mosquitoes, and a 48% decrease in survival for individuals with disseminated vs. nondisseminated infections. These results were corroborated by other experiments in which survival of mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with RVF virus was compared with that of those inoculated with diluent. In both the per os and inoculation tests, uninfected mosquitoes survived significantly longer than infected mosquitoes. Even though mosquitoes with disseminated infections had a lower survival rate than did uninfected mosquitoes, dissemination and transmission rates were similar at days 7 and 14-18 after the infectious bloodmeal. This suggests that nondisseminated individuals were developing disseminated infections and becoming capable of transmitting virus between days 7 and 14-18 at approximately the same rate older transmitters were dying. The decreased survival associated with RVF viral infection should be considered in predictive models of this disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Warthin's tumor: multicentricity and increasing incidence in women.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Warthin's tumors comprised 14 percent of all parotid tumors operated on. The average patient age in our series was 57.2 years. Eighty-seven percent of the tumors occurred in the parotid tail. The rest were in the deep lobe, or in an extraparotid location. Fifteen patients had multifocal tumors. The maximum number of tumor foci in one patient was six. A significant increase in the female incidence was noted with a 1.5:1 male-to-female ratio as compared with the previous male dominant ratio of 8:1. Eighty-two percent of the female patients in our group were smokers. We correlated a very high incidence of cigarette smoking in our series when compared with age-matched groups in both sexes within the general population. Since it is estimated that one of eight patients with Warthin's tumor will have multifocal disease, we suggest wider exposure and more meticulous operative exploration to avoid overlooked synchronous tumor foci and subsequent recurrence.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Craniofacial resections for tumors involving the base of the skull.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Over a 10 year period, 42 patients with tumors involving the base of the skull underwent operation at our institution. Twenty-six patients had tumors involving the anterior fossa and cribriform plate, 3 patients had tumors involving the anterior fossa and orbit, 3 patients had invasion of the middle fossa, 5 patients had invasion of the temporal bone, and 5 patients had invasion of the clivus. A detailed analysis of the 26 patients who underwent craniofacial resection for tumors invading the anterior fossa cribriform plate region has been presented. Histologic studies revealed epithelial tumors in 18 patients, sarcoma in 6 patients, melanoma in one patient, and ossifying fibroma in one patient. The median survival in this group of patients was 60 months. Survival was influenced by histologic diagnosis. Malignant tumors involving the base of the skull can be successfully resected using a craniofacial approach with minimum morbidity and acceptable operative mortality as demonstrated in this experience. Unfavorable prognostic factors included massive intracranial extension, high grade tumor, and previous treatment failure.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- In this study, 59 percent of the patients with squamous cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract were considered malnourished by the independent evaluation of a registered dietitian. Malnourished patients tended to present in a more advanced stage of disease, underwent more extensive operative procedures, had more complications, experienced longer hospital stay, and had a higher proportion of irradiated patients compared with patients who were nutritionally healthy. Malnourished patients who received nutritional support preoperatively demonstrated lower complication rates and shorter lengths of hospital stay compared with malnourished patients who underwent similar operative procedures without preoperative nutritional supplementation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Surgical treatment of invasion of the upper aerodigestive tract by well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Forty-eight patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma invading upper aerodigestive tract structures have been described. Age at diagnosis was found to be a negative prognostic factor, and duration of disease before invasion was found to be a positive prognostic factor. Treatment with radical surgery and adjuvant therapy provided no improvement in survival over treatment with near-total (skeletonizing) excisions combined with adjuvant therapy. All patients treated with partial debulking procedures, with or without tracheotomy, died from disease. We believe that partial resection of upper aerodigestive tract structures without sacrifice of voice, normal breathing, or swallowing should be considered in patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of decicurie doses of radioactive iodine 131 on parathyroid function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although parathyroid deficiency has been reported after administration of relatively small doses of iodine 131, reports of such deficiency after the much larger doses given in the management of thyroid cancer are notable by their absence in the literature. We observed one such patient, then instituted a prospective study. We observed a 58 percent incidence of apparently diminished parathyroid reserve among 53 patients given high doses of I 131. Susceptibility does not appear to be related to age, sex, extent of thyroid operation, operative technique, the amount of thyroidal I 131 uptake, the use of external radiation to the neck, or to the presence of parathyroid glands or of Hashimoto's disease in the operative specimen; however, susceptibility may be related to the anatomic location of the parathyroid glands in relation to the thyroid gland. The administered dose of I 131 almost reached significant levels (p = 0.1) in the present study. The initial pretreatment serum calcium levels were consistently lower among affected patients (p = 0.01), suggesting the presence of a preexisting latent impairment of parathyroid reserve which was subsequently unmasked after the administration of I 131. Thyroid cancer is compatible with very long-term survival, and therefore, there is a considerable risk of delayed chronic hypocalcemia among patients who have received large doses of I 131, particularly female patients in the premenopausal age group. These patients deserve special management surveillance.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reconstruction of hypopharyngeal defects in cancer surgery: do we have a choice?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1982 and 1985, 83 patients with hypopharyngeal or extensive laryngeal cancers underwent pharyngoesophagectomy (48 patients), circumferential pharyngectomy (8 patients), and partial pharyngectomy (27 patients), depending on the site and extent of tumor involvement. The resultant hypopharyngeal defects were reconstructed with gastric transposition, a tubed pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, and a pectoralis major flap patch, respectively. There were three hospital deaths in the gastric transposition group (6 percent) and none in both pectoralis major flap groups. The leakage rate was 8.3 percent in the gastric transposition group, 25 percent in the tubed pectoralis major flap group, and 3.7 percent in the pectoralis major flap patch group. Stricture was avoided with the interdigitation technique used at the tubed-flap-to-esophagus anastomosis, although the fistula rate was high. The overall complication rate was higher with gastric transposition. Although swallowing was satisfactory in all three groups, 42 percent of the patients with gastric transposition experienced regurgitation. Over a follow-up period of 16 to 50 months the local recurrence rate was 5 percent, and the actuarial survival rate was 55 percent at 24 months.</ABSTRACT>

The fistulas were closed with pectoralis major muscle flaps in four patients, pectoralis musculocutaneous flaps in seven patients, sternocleidomastoid muscle flaps in four patients, and latissimus dorsi flaps in two patients. Four types of fistulas were identified, and flap selection was determined by fistula location. Successful closure was obtained in 15 patients (88 percent), although one patient died from recurrence with a persistent fistula.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Healing between cartilage and bone ends. An experimental study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Whether healing or nonunion occurs at the junction between cartilage and bone was studied in an animal experimental model. The costochondral junctions of the floating ribs of rabbits were excised and the cut ends of bone and cartilage reapproximated with wire. The process of healing was then observed. Fibrocartilaginous callus formed in the first week. Beginning in the second week, this was gradually replaced by bony callus, a process which started from the medullary cavity of the bone end. The cut end of the original cartilage showed no activity. The periosteum and perichondrium became continuous at 4 weeks. The site of ossification assumed the appearance of the original costochondral junction. The gap between the original cartilage and the new cartilage disappeared when fusion occurred at 48 weeks. Osteochondral junctions at various periods after operation were subjected to disruption force until the junctions were pulled apart. The average force required to break 16 junctions was 2,738 g, and was not related to the period of healing.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ten years experience with the free jejunal autograft.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Retrospective analysis by chart review, personal interview, and physical examination identified 88 patients who received 96 jejunal free flaps over a 10 year period. Seventy-nine of these patients had cancer. There were 13 operative failures (13.5 percent) in 10 patients. Failures were attributed to arterial thrombosis in four instances, venous anastomotic problems in four instances, fistula and infection in the neck in one instance, carotid blowout in one instance, psychosis with avulsion in one instance, and an unknown cause in two instances. Seven second attempts at salvage of jejunal flaps were performed with five successes. There were five deaths in the perioperative period (6 percent). Of these, one was directly attributed to graft failure. The following eight abdominal complications required operation: wound dehiscence (four instances), small bowel obstruction (one instance), Mallory-Weiss tear (one instance), gastrostomy tube leak (one instance), and acute gastric dilatation (one instance). Complications in the neck included infection (six instances), infection requiring operation (three instances), hematoma (three instances), and suture line dehiscence (one instance). Fistulas developed in 28 patients (32 percent), 12 of whom required operative closure (43 percent). Significant stenosis developed in six patients, two of whom required operative revision. Of 79 patients treated for cancer, 34 died from progression of disease which recurred an average of 9.7 months postoperatively. Death ensued an average of 16.7 months postoperatively. Ten patients died with no evidence of disease. At last follow-up, 28 patients were alive without apparent disease. Twenty-six of these patients have good swallowing function. Significant palliation and a high rate of restoration of function are possible with the free jejunal autograft. Careful patient selection should markedly decrease operative morbidity and mortality.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Microsurgery for macrodefects: microvascular free-tissue transfer for massive defects of the head and neck.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Despite defect location and the fear of creating complex massive defects, coverage of large areas of soft tissue loss, with or without exposed calvaria, dura, and brain, can be reconstructed reliably with microvascular free tissue transfer. This technique permits separation of the oronasopharynyx from the intracranial contents, coverage of dural grafts, restoration of composite tissue loss, and achievement of superior aesthetic results in a single stage. When choosing vascular anastomotic sites, free-flap transfer permits a greater latitude in flap orientation, tailoring, and inset than is possible when using fixed pedicled rotation flaps. When confronted with a deeply invasive or gigantic malignancy, a multidisciplinary team approach is optimal. The risk associated with sophisticated ablative and reconstructive operative procedures is justified when dealing with potentially curable lesions. The success of these extensive procedures is related not only to the functional result and the aesthetic appearance, but most importantly to the resultant quality of life they allow.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Voice restoration after total laryngopharyngectomy and cervical esophagectomy using the duckbill prosthesis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We have presented a series of 10 patients who were successfully rehabilitated using the tracheoesophageal puncture technique for voice restoration. These patients underwent total laryngopharyngectomy or laryngopharyngoesophagectomy and reconstruction with visceral transposition (five patients), myocutaneous flaps (four patients), and skin graft and cervical flaps (one patient). All patients were able to produce adequate voice and carry on a conversation. Clinical evaluation of voice quality and acoustic analysis of voice samples indicate that the voice obtained in these patients was intelligible, and had adequate intensity, low pitch, and limited pitch variation. There were no complications related to the voice restoration procedure. It appears from our data and the limited experience reported in the literature that the tracheoesophageal prosthesis can be used successfully and safely for the speech rehabilitation of patients who undergo total laryngopharyngectomy, cervical esophagectomy, or both, regardless of the reconstructive method used.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa: analysis of prognostic factors.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although the TNM system is the accepted standard for head and neck tumor classification, there are often discrepancies between tumor size and survival. This retrospective analysis of 89 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa was carried out to evaluate tumor thickness and depth of invasion as prognostic variables and to compare them to the standard parameters. Recurrence rates increased with tumor size, clinical stage, thickness, and depth of invasion. In univariate analysis, sex, clinical stage, thickness, and depth of invasion were significantly related to survival (p less than 0.10). Multivariate analysis revealed that only thickness was an independent variable (p less than 0.0001). Patients with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness had a significantly better survival rate compared with those patients with tumors greater than 6 mm in thickness, regardless of the tumor stage. Measurement of tumor thickness should be included in estimating prognosis, planning therapy, and comparing results in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Total glossectomy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Total glossectomy is a procedure based on sound oncologic principles, and its usefulness may not be fully appreciated. Given the dimensions of the tongue and the need to obtain a wide margin of resection, this procedure may be indicated in selected T3 lesions and recurrences after irradiation. The procedure offers excellent palliation of pain, and form and function may be preserved by rim mandibulectomy when indicated. New reconstructive techniques allow for speedier recovery. Aspiration need not be a complication of total glossectomy if care is taken to preserve the superior laryngeal nerve. Speech rehabilitation plays an important role in returning these patients to their normal environment. Overall 1 and 3 year disease-free survival rates have been encouraging.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Rim mandibulectomy for cancer of the oral cavity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Improvements in our understanding of the methods of mandibular invasion by malignancies and refinements in the biomechanical analysis of mandibular osteotomies led us to modify our standard operative procedure for this disease process. Over a 10 year period, we performed rim mandibulectomy to treat oral cavity malignancies with mandibular involvement. This retrospective analysis of 38 patients comparing rim mandibulectomy with the traditional segmental mandibulectomy has demonstrated equivalent local control rates between rim mandibulectomy and segmental resection (75 and 64 percent, respectively). Patients with rim mandibulectomies were more satisfied with their postoperative appearance, and some were able to wear lower dentures if well motivated. In performing the rim mandibulectomy, we found that smooth, curved osteotomies without step-offs resulted in a technically simple operation that was biomechanically sound and had a low complication rate. Rim mandibulectomy, because it is based on sound pathologic principles and does not disrupt the mandibular arch, is an operation that adequately resects the tumor without compromising the cancer operation or the patient.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Polyamine metabolism in carcinoma of the oral cavity compared with adjacent and normal oral mucosa.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In this study, polyamine biosynthesis required for cellular proliferation showed elevated levels in neoplastic cells. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, as well as the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, were measured to evaluate differences in tissue concentration in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, and in the normal adjacent, buccal, and retromolar trigone tissues. Mean polyamine levels (nanomoles per gram of tissue +/- standard error of the mean) were significantly elevated in tumor tissue at 136 +/- 42 nmol/g for putrescine compared with 41 +/- 9 nmol/g in adjacent, 25 +/- 5 nmol/g in buccal, and 41 +/- 14 nmol/g in retromolar trigone tissues. Tumor spermidine was 415 +/- 41 nmol/g compared with 192 +/- 34 nmol/g in adjacent, 184 +/- 34 nmol/g in buccal, and 214 +/- 63 nmol/g in retromolar trigone tissues. Tumor spermine was 461 +/- 41 nmol/g compared with 236 +/- 30 nmol/g in adjacent, 233 +/- 35 nmol/g in buccal, and 269 +/- 59 nmol/g in retromolar trigone samples. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was highly variable in tumor tissues. High levels of polyamines appear to be specific for this malignancy, whereas ornithine decarboxylase activity is not. Measurement of polyamine content may be useful in evaluating epithelial changes in the oral cavity.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lung cancer in patients with head and neck cancer. Incidence and long-term survival.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Of the 3,907 cases of primary head and neck or lung cancer diagnosed between 1961 and 1984, 94 patients were identified with a history of cancer at both sites. The total incidence of lung cancer in our head and neck cancer patients was 5.4 percent. Of the 94 patients, 73 had both cancers diagnosed at our institution. These 73 patients were further analyzed. Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 63 percent of the lung cancers. Twenty of the lung cancers were synchronous and 47 were metachronous after head and neck cancer. Of the synchronous lung cancers, 50 percent were postoperative stage I, whereas only 11 percent of the metachronous cancers were postoperative stage I. The lung cancer survival rate was significantly better for the synchronous cancer group at 5 years (34 percent) than for the metachronous cancer group (5 percent). The better survival rate was evidently due to the greater proportion of early-stage lung lesions. The relatively large number of advanced-stage lung lesions in the metachronous cancer group suggests that aggressive screening of head and neck cancer patients for lung cancer may detect more metachronous lung cancers at an earlier stage and thus improve the survival rate of these patients.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- This retrospective study on 832 head and neck cancer patients who died between 1961 and 1985 was carried out to determine the incidence and sites of distant metastases. All patients were staged prior to definitive treatment and were autopsied. The overall incidence of distant metastases was 47 percent. The hypopharynx had the highest incidence of distant metastases (60 percent), followed by the base of the tongue (53 percent) and the anterior tongue (50 percent). Of the 387 patients with distant metastases, 91 percent died with uncontrolled tumor either at the primary site or in the neck. The lung was the most common site of distant metastases (80 percent), followed by the mediastinal nodes (34 percent), the liver (31 percent), and bone (31 percent). Overall, 6 percent of the patients had stage I disease, 20 percent had stage II disease, 32 percent had stage III disease, and 43 percent had stage IV disease. The highest incidence of distant metastases was found in those patients with stage IV disease (193 of 350 patients, 55 percent). We believe that the initial stage of disease does appear to be related to the ultimate development of the distant metastases.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Response to radiotherapy of head and neck tumors in AIDS patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Initial manifestations of AIDS in the head and neck area occur frequently. In fact, up to 40 percent of patients may have involvement of the head and neck. The most common malignancies are Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Since AIDS-related malignancies are a relatively new problem for radiation oncologists, optimal therapy for these neoplasms is unknown. A retrospective review of AIDS patients treated with radiotherapy has been performed. Fourteen patients were identified. Of these, five were treated for head and neck tumors (four for Kaposi's sarcoma and one for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, were seen to be as radioresponsive as the classical forms, but local control was difficult to achieve. Kaposi's sarcoma tended to recur marginally and within the field. Nonetheless, we believe radiotherapy can offer significant palliation for AIDS patients with head and neck tumors. It is of utmost importance that the head and neck surgeon must be acutely aware of the common patterns of presentation of this disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Treatment results and patterns of failure in 646 patients with carcinoma of the eyelids, pinna, and nose.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- From 1956 to 1978, 646 patients were treated with radiotherapy for carcinoma of the nose (350 patients, 54 percent), eyelids (159 patients, 25 percent), pinna (93 patients, 14 percent), and skin adjacent to the lip (44 patients, 7 percent). The histologic distribution was 72 percent basal cell carcinoma, 18 percent squamous cell carcinoma, and 10 percent mixed basal and squamous cell features. Tumors less than 2 cm in diameter were found in 602 patients (93 percent), whereas 44 patients (7 percent) had larger tumors. Tumor involvement of cartilage and bone was seen in 23 patients at the time of diagnosis. The 5, 10, and 20 year control rates were 99 percent, 98 percent, and 98 percent, respectively, for 502 tumors less than 2 cm in diameter. This compared favorably with control rates of 92 percent at 5 years and 79 percent at 10 years for tumors from 2 to 5 cm in diameter and 60 percent at 5 years and 53 percent at 8 years for 12 patients with massive tumors (p less than 0.0001). The histologic characteristics of the lesion had a strong influence on tumor control (p less than 0.02). Of the patients with cartilage or bone invasion, tumor was controlled in 19 (83 percent). Of these 19 patients, 11 had no evidence of disease for 3 years or more. Of all 646 patients treated, failure was seen in 60 (9 percent). It correlated well with the size of the lesion, being 7 percent for tumors of less than 2 cm and 50 percent for tumors of greater than 5 cm. Of the 60 patients in whom treatment failed, 48 (80 percent) had prior definitive therapy. Radiotherapy was an efficient modality to control operative failures; however, it was not as efficient at control in patients in whom previous radiotherapy failed. Operation was the treatment of choice to salvage patients in whom radiotherapy failed. Of the patients in whom retreatment failed, 10 were known to have died from skin cancer, and an additional 6 patients were presumed to have died from the cancer. This study has demonstrated a good control rate and good cosmetic results for small tumors of the eyelids, pinna, and nose. In addition, a good control rate was obtained in patients with cartilage and bone involvement. Treatment of massive tumors should involve planned operative resection with adjuvant radiotherapy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Tactile orotracheal tube placement test. A bimanual tactile examination of the positioned orotracheal tube to confirm laryngeal placement.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The development of a tactile clinical test of the positioned orotracheal tube is described which allows confirmation of its location within the larynx. It was possible, after preliminary experience with the test, to confirm laryngeal placement confidently in an average of 97% of cases in two concurrent series each of which consisted of 100 patients. Inevitably, there are limitations to its usefulness but it has the advantage that no special apparatus is required for its performance. The implications of this test are discussed in relation to difficult intubation, obstetric anaesthesia, the teaching of applied anatomy and checking by their trainers of intubations performed by very junior anaesthetists. Familiarity with this test should be considered essential for its reliable implementation.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Of 20 volunteers, five were given intravenous Diazemuls 15 mg over 15 seconds, and three groups of five were given lormetazepam 2 mg intravenously over 10, 20 and 60 seconds, respectively. Laryngeal reactivity and psychomotor function were tested at intervals from prior to injection until 4 hours after injection. For equivalent degrees of depression of psychomotor function, lormetazepam depressed the laryngeal reflex less than Diazemuls (p = 0.004). Lormetazepam give over 60 seconds depressed the laryngeal reflex more than when given over 10 seconds (p = 0.008) or over 20 seconds (p = 0.048), although a significant difference was not demonstrated between the 10-second and 20-second groups. These results concur with experimental evidence that benzodiazepine receptor multiplicity exists, which allows various members of the benzodiazepine group of drugs to exhibit differing therapeutic ratios for their various effects.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Histamine levels and cardiovascular responses during splenectomy and splenorenal shunt formation in a patient with systemic mastocytosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disorder characterised by the infiltration of many tissues by abnormal numbers of mast cells. Life-threatening episodes of bronchospasm and hypotension are common in response to a variety of triggers which cause mast cell degranulation. We present the case history of a patient with severe mast cell disease who successfully underwent splenectomy and portocaval anastomosis. Peri-operative therapy was directed towards mast cell stabilisation, and histamine-releasing drugs were avoided. Cardiovascular data, together with blood histamine levels and thrombin times, indicated that mast cell degranulation did not occur. A review of the current literature concerning mast cell disease as it relates to anaesthesia is presented and suggestions for the safe management of such cases are given.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A new laryngoscope. A modified laryngoscope to facilitate intubation in cases of restricted access.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This is a report of a modification to one design of laryngoscope to increase the angle between blade and handle, to facilitate intubation in cases of difficult access, such as in obstetric practice or in patients in whom neck flexion is limited, for example by skull traction. The modification offers the unique advantage of two useful blade angles in one instrument. The first type described would be suitable for use in small units where it is thought that a laryngoscope solely for use in rare cases of difficult access would not be justified. It would also be suitable for inclusion in resuscitation kits for use both within and outside hospital. The second type would be more suitable for the maternity or spinal injuries unit, or the difficult intubation box of a general operating theatre suite.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Arterial oxygen saturation during general anaesthesia for paediatric dental extractions.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured in 50 healthy children undergoing dental extractions under general anaesthesia. An inhalational anaesthetic technique was employed, with an inspired oxygen concentration of 33%. There were decreases in SaO2 of greater than 5% of the baseline value in 70% of patients, and greater than 10% in 26% of patients. The majority of these decreases were associated with teeth extractions or during placement of dental prop and pack. Non-Caucasian children showed a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater maximum decrease in SaO2 from baseline value compared to Caucasian children. The maximum decreases in SaO2 from baseline value in children anaesthetised by supervised dental students, and in children whose extractions were performed by dental students, were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than in children whose anaesthetic and surgery were performed by members of staff.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Induction and recovery times were not significantly different between two groups that received halothane with trichloroethylene and isoflurane, respectively. Maintenance of anaesthesia and analgesia was also satisfactory. Isoflurane resulted in a higher heart rate (p less than 0.01), a lower respiratory rate (p less than 0.01) and a higher inspired oxygen concentration (p less than 0.05). Respiration may be more efficient. Other potential advantages of isoflurane for anaesthesia in the field are discussed. Despite the fact that it is 15 times more expensive, the use of isoflurane as sole agent is recommended.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sufentanil pharmacokinetics in pediatric cardiovascular patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pharmacokinetics of sufentanil were studied in 28 pediatric patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures. Patients were divided into four groups on the basis of age: neonates (0-1 month, n = 9), infants (1-24 months, n = 7), children (2-12 yr, n = 7), and adolescents (12-18 yr, n = 5). Sufentanil 10-15 micrograms/kg, was administered by IV bolus and plasma concentrations measured for up to 20 hr. A tri-exponential equation best described the time-concentration data in all patients. Clearance rate (Cl) was 6.7 +/- 6.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 (+/- SD) in neonates, which was significantly lower than the values of 18.1 +/- 2.7, 16.9 +/- 3.2, and 13.1 +/- 3.6 ml.kg-1 min-1 observed in infants, children, and adolescents, respectively. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 4.15 +/- 1.0 L/kg in neonates, significantly greater than the values of 2.73 +/- 0.5 and 2.75 +/- 0.5 L/kg observed in children and adolescents, respectively. The elimination half-life (T1/2 beta) was 783 +/- 346 min in neonates, significantly longer than the values of 214 +/- 41, 140 +/- 30, and 209 +/- 23 min observed in infants, children, and adolescents, respectively. The plasma concentration of sufentanil at the time of additional anesthetic supplementation to suppress hemodynamic responses to surgical stimulation was 2.51 ng/ml in neonates, significantly higher than the levels of 1.58, 1.53, and 1.56 ng/ml observed in infants, children, and adolescents, respectively. The authors conclude that age-related differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of sufentanil are evident in pediatric patients with major cardiovascular disease who are undergoing cardiovascular surgery.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of isoflurane on myocardial blood flow, function, and oxygen consumption in the presence of critical coronary stenosis in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Because isoflurane has been reported to produce coronary steal, we studied 12 open chest, anesthetized (pentobarbital) dogs with critical stenosis (CS) of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCA). Sonomicrometers were implanted to measure systolic wall thickening, myocardial blood flow (MBF) was measured with microspheres (15 microns diameter), and regional venous sampling was performed to estimate regional oxygen extraction and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Anesthetic concentrations of isoflurane reduced arterial blood pressure dramatically, resulting in a maldistribution of MBF distal to the CS consistent with the pattern characterizing a transmural coronary steal effect. Elevation of arterial blood pressure with phenylephrine during high concentration isoflurane (1.7 +/- 0.1%) augmented MBF, but the maldistribution distal to the CS persisted. Despite the maldistribution, however, there was no indication of ischemia in the LCA region because systolic wall thickening, oxygen extraction, and MVO2 were not significantly different between the LCA and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (control) areas. Because wall thickening, oxygen extraction, and MVO2 were markedly reduced by isoflurane in both the LCA and control areas, it was concluded that isoflurane substantially reduced myocardial oxygen requirements by inducing myocardial depression, reducing heart rate, and decreasing afterload. Consequently, the apparent maldistribution of LCA blood flow (coronary steal) was due to the hemodynamic and vasodilatory effects of isoflurane, but did not result in ischemia because the level of blood flow was at or above the requirements of the myocardium.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of nitrous oxide on cortical cerebral blood flow during anesthesia with halothane and isoflurane, with and without morphine, in the rabbit.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of nitrous oxide on cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined during a varying background anesthetic state in the New Zealand White rabbit. Seventy percent nitrous oxide resulted in significant and similar increases in CBF during anesthesia with both 0.5 MAC of halothane (44 +/- 14 to 63 +/- 17 ml.100 g-1.min-1) (mean +/- SD) and anesthesia with isoflurane (34 +/- 9 to 41 +/- 11 ml.100 g-1.min-1). During anesthesia with 1.0 MAC halothane or isoflurane, N2O also increased CBF, but the increments (halothane, 73 +/- 34 to 111 +/- 54 ml.100 g-1 min-1; isoflurane 34 +/- 13 to 69 +/- 34 ml.100 g-1.min-1) were significantly greater than those observed at 0.5 MAC. When 0.5 MAC halothane or isoflurane was supplemented with morphine (10 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 2 mg.kg-1.min-1), the CBF effect of N2O was not significantly different from that observed with 0.5 MAC alone. It was concluded that, in the rabbit, the effects of N2O on cortical CBF vary with the background anesthetic state and that the increase in CBF caused by N2O becomes greater as the end-tidal concentration of halothane or isoflurane increases from 0.5 to 1.0 MAC. Morphine, when added to 0.5 MAC of halothane or isoflurane, does not alter the effect of 70% N2O on cortical CBF.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cardiovascular responses to acute loading with nifedipine alone and nifedipine plus propranolol during inhalation anesthesia in monkeys.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The cardiovascular effects of the administration of nifedipine and nifedipine combined with propranolol were examined in 15 monkeys during 0.75 and 1.25 MAC of anesthesia with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane. Hemodynamic variables measured included heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximum rate of increase of the Left ventricular pressure (max LV dP/dt), and thermodilution cardiac output (CO). The infusion of nifedipine at a rate adequate to produce therapeutic blood levels during 0.75 MAC with each anesthetic decreased MAP and SVR, but had no effect on cardiac index (CI), max LV dP/dt, or HR. Increasing the anesthetic concentration from 0.75 to 1.25 MAC during nifedipine administration decreased HR and MAP in all groups and decreased CI with halothane and enflurane, but not with isoflurane. Addition of propranolol by infusion in amounts adequate to produce 75% beta-adrenergic blockade caused a further depression of CI, max LV dP/dt, HR, and MAP. However, the hemodynamic depression was significantly greater with halothane and enflurane than with isoflurane. Intravenous administration of calcium chloride (10 mg/kg) after calcium channel and beta-adrenergic blockade only partially reversed the hemodynamic depression that occurred with all three anesthetics. It was concluded that acute loading with nifedipine with and without propranolol exerts a greater cardiovascular depressant effect during enflurane or halothane anesthesia than during isoflurane anesthesia. The myocardial depressant effects of nifedipine and propranolol myocardial depressant effects of nifedipine and propranolol may be synergistic with the depressant effects of potent inhalation anesthetics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric lidocaine and bupivacaine: effects of epinephrine on the plasma concentration profiles.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of epinephrine on the plasma concentration profiles and some derived pharmacokinetic parameters were studied after subarachnoid injection of hyperbaric lidocaine and bupivacaine solutions. Addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetic solution reduced the mean peak plasma concentration of lidocaine from 526 to 376 ng/ml, but did not significantly reduce the mean peak plasma concentration of bupivacaine (70 vs 56 ng/ml). Epinephrine did not affect the times at which the peak concentrations were reached, the terminal half-lives, or the total plasma clearances. The observed effects of epinephrine on the peak plasma concentrations are consistent with the vascular activity of lidocaine and bupivacaine, respectively.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Antagonism of postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression: nalbuphine versus naloxone.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors compared naloxone and nalbuphine as antagonists of opioid-induced respiratory depression to determine the relative efficacies and safety of the two agents. In a double-blind, randomized fashion, 90 anesthetized patients received a mean dose of 25 micrograms/kg fentanyl during surgery. Inadequate spontaneous respirations at the end of anesthesia were treated with either naloxone 0.08 mg or nalbuphine 2.5 mg IV every 2 min while heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP), respiratory rate (RR), and tidal volume (TV) were measured at 2-min intervals. Arterial blood samples for analysis of PaCO2, PaO2, and pH were drawn when spontaneous ventilation resumed, and 30 and 60 min later. Narcotic antagonism and respiration were deemed adequate when TV was greater than or equal to 4 ml/kg and RR greater than or equal to 8 breaths/min. Heart rate, SBP, DBP, TV and RR were recorded, as were the occurrence of renarcotization (RR less than 8) and analgesic requirements every 5 min during the recovery room stay. Sixty of 90 patients required narcotic antagonism at the end of surgery. No patient required more than three doses (0.24 mg) of naloxone or four doses (10 mg) of nalbuphine. Both antagonists produced similar and moderate increases in SBP and HR while restoring adequate spontaneous ventilation. There were no significant differences in TV, RR, or arterial blood gases (ABGS) between the two groups after narcotic reversal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Venous air embolism and active lung inflation at high and low CVP: a study in "upright" anesthetized sheep.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To assess the safety and efficacy of the maneuver of active lung inflation (ALI) after venous air embolism, measurements were made of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), central venous pressure (CVP), and superior jugular bulb pressure (JbP) as an index of cerebral venous sinus pressure in eight sheep before and after a 2-ml/kg air embolus and before and in the release phase of an ALI to a pressure of 4 kPa (30 mm Hg). (PAOP-CVP) difference decreased significantly after the air embolus with a further decrease after ALI (P less than 0.01). An increase in JbP occurred with ALI only when the CVP was elevated before the injection of air. After air embolism in neurosurgery, ALI may increase the likelihood of paradoxical embolism in patients at risk and may also fail to help in identifying the site of air entry.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Embolized air collection in the superior vena cava of "upright" sheep.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 34 studies on six "upright" anesthetized sheep central venous pressure from sites in the upper and lower superior vena cava (SVC) was recorded before, during, and after the injection into a neck vein of 1-ml increments of air every minute for 15 min. After the injection of air, the pressure recorded from the upper site increased significantly. This increase was the result of air collecting in the SVC with a consequent loss or partial loss of the SVC hydrostatic pressure difference. The time of onset and the duration of collection were not influenced by hyper- or hypovolemia nor by 1 kPa positive end-expiratory pressure. The readily identifiable change in the venous pressure in the upper SVC provided an earlier and more reliable warning of these small-volume air emboli than did a Doppler probe directed at the right side of the heart.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Stimulatory effects of halothane and isoflurane on fluoride release and cytochrome P-450 loss caused by metabolism of 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene, a halothane metabolite.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The structural similarity of the halothane metabolite, 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene (CDE), to haloethenes that are metabolized by and inactivate cytochrome P-450, suggests that CDE may undergo secondary metabolism and degrade these isozymes. This possibility was examined in hepatic microsomes by determining fluoride release and cytochrome P-450 loss due to CDE metabolism in the presence of several anesthetics. CDE alone decreased cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-treated rats by as much as 37%, but the addition of isoflurane or halothane to incubations containing CDE increased the loss of cytochrome P-450 nearly twofold. Fluoride release was enhanced approximately 2.5 to 3 times by halothane or isoflurane; however, fluroxene inhibited fluoride release and did not enhance the loss of cytochrome P-450. Extrapolation of these results to the clinical situation suggests that the metabolism of CDE produced during halothane anesthesia and the accompanying cytochrome P-450 loss may contribute to the inhibition of drug metabolism produced by halothane.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Incidence of hypotension associated with epidural anesthesia using alkalinized and nonalkalinized lidocaine for cesarean section.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The onset of epidural anesthesia is accelerated by alkalinization of lidocaine with added epinephrine (LE). The possibility that decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) are also enhanced was studied in 21 patients having elective cesarean sections. Ten patients given LE + NaHCO3 (0.1 mEq/ml anesthetic solution) compared with 11 given LE alone had significantly (P less than 0.05) greater decreases in SBP (32% vs 19% from baseline values), as well as a greater rate of SBP decline to those minimum values (9%/min vs 3%/min, respectively). These differences were noted despite the fact that patients given LE + HCO3 received no less ephedrine and no more additional anesthetic than controls. Possible adverse effects of SBP reduction on uteroplacental blood flow suggest that caution be used in the use of alkalinized LE in obstetrical patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of ketanserin on blood pressure and platelets during cardiopulmonary bypass.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Ketanserin, a serotonin antagonist, was used to control blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass in 12 patients having cardiac surgery. The drug was administered as a 10 mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of either 40, 80, or 120 mg/hr to maintain mean arterial blood pressure below 70 mm Hg. There were 16 hypertensive episodes of which 15 (93.7%) were successfully controlled with ketanserin. Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from an average of 72 +/- 3 to 52 +/- 9 mm Hg after 1 min. The effect that ketanserin had on platelets was also evaluated. Neither adverse nor salutary effects were seen in the platelet count, though a significant inhibition of serotonin-induced platelet aggregation was observed. Ketanserin proved effective for controlling hypertension during cardiopulmonary bypass but, despite inhibition of serotonin-induced platelet aggregation, it did not prevent thrombocytopenia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of midazolam and thiopental for rapid sequence anesthetic induction for elective cesarean section.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sixty healthy mothers undergoing elective cesarean section received at random either midazolam 0.2 mg/kg or thiopental 3.5 mg/kg with succinylcholine 1 mg/kg for rapid sequence intravenous anesthetic induction. Maintenance of anesthesia was identical in all patients: 50:50 N2O in oxygen, halothane 0.5% and pancuronium 0.05 mg/kg. Hemodynamic responses were similar, as were the biochemical status of mothers and infants, and maternal to fetal blood gas/acid base gradients. Correlation between maternal arterial and fetal (umbilical venous/arterial) pH, PCO2 and base excess values were statistically better with midazolam. However, 1-min Apgar minus color (A-C) scores less than 5/8 (representing "severe" neonatal depression) were recorded in five infants after midazolam, three of whom required tracheal intubation, and one whose mother was given thiopental. This difference reached statistical significance (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that midazolam is less suitable than thiopental for anesthetic induction in patients undergoing cesarean section.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dezocine-MAC reduction and evidence for myocardial depression in the presence of enflurane.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of dezocine, an agonist-antagonist opioid analgesic, on enflurane MAC (EMAC) was measured in dogs and, in a separate study, the hemodynamic effects of IV bolus doses of dezocine in the presence of a stable end-tidal enflurane concentration were measured. Study 1 (n = 8)--EMAC Reduction: Dezocine reduced EMAC in a dose-dependent fashion by a maximum of 58 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) after injection of 20 mg/kg. Cardiac toxicity prevented administration of higher doses. Study 2--Hemodynamics: Group 1 (n = 7) received dezocine 0.2, 1.5, 5, and 20 mg/kg IV each as a bolus over 30 sec. Group 2 (n = 5) was studied in exactly the same manner except that instead of dezocine, each dog received drug carrier solution alone (carrier). Significant hemodynamic differences between carrier and drug groups were observed only at the 20 mg/kg dose level, which produced death in one dog and a decrease in mean aortic pressure to 39 +/- 5% of baseline, in cardiac output to 60 +/- 9% of baseline, and in stroke volume to 69 +/- 9% of baseline in the remaining dogs. It is concluded that dezocine produces a dose-dependent reduction in EMAC limited by cardiovascular toxicity. This toxicity appears to be related to direct myocardial depression by high doses of dezocine in the presence of enflurane.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Analgesic doses of epidural morphine do not affect local glucose utilization in the spinal cord in rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The possibility of association between changes in spinal cord metabolism and changes in spinal cord neuronal activity by injection of morphine into the epidural space in amounts adequate to produce analgesia was examined. Fourteen Wistar rats were equally divided into two groups: a morphine group (epidural, 15 micrograms) and a control group (saline). Using the 2-[14C] deoxyglucose method, glucose utilization was measured in the spinal cord and in the brain, including structures related to pain modulation, in the presence and in the absence of analgesia produced by epidural morphine as confirmed by the hot plate test. Glucose utilization was shown to be similar in the spinal cord and in the brain in both groups of animals. The results suggest that analgesic doses of epidural morphine do not affect neuronal activity of the spinal cord by changing spinal cord carbohydrate metabolism.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effects of succinylcholine on mouth opening.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Mouth opening and the resistance to opening developed by the muscles of mastication were measured in 63 children anesthetized with halothane and relaxed with succinylcholine, pancuronium, or vecuronium. Measurement of mouth opening, induced by a constant test force, was made when each patient was deeply anesthetized, as judged by clinical parameters. Succinylcholine, vecuronium, or pancuronium was then administered. The mouth opening measurement was repeated immediately after the loss of limb muscle twitch response and 45 s following the loss of twitch response. For the 24 patients receiving succinylcholine, there was a significant reduction in mean mouth opening (P less than 0.0001) and a significant increase in jaw stiffness (P less than 0.0001) immediately after limb relaxation. Forty-five seconds after full limb relaxation was attained, the mean mouth opening was still reduced (P less than 0.0001) and the mean jaw stiffness was still increased (P less than 0.0003) in the succinylcholine group. Patients receiving either vecuronium or pancuronium did not show a significant change of mouth opening or jaw stiffness following limb relaxation. Three patients, who received succinylcholine, required several attempts at tracheal intubation due to increased resistance to mouth opening. Anesthesia and surgery proceeded in all patients. None of the patients developed malignant hyperthermia. In view of the fact that a reduction in mouth opening was a constant finding when succinylcholine was administered during halothane anesthesia, the assumption that isolated "masseter spasm" or jaw stiffness heralds malignant hyperthermia should be reconsidered.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The effects of intravenous droperidol, 0.2 mg . kg-1, on baroreflex control of heart rate and on plasma catecholamine levels were determined in 10 ASA physical status I unpremedicated patients. Baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by a pressor test using phenylephrine. Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, and plasma droperidol concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, from blood samples withdrawn before baroreflex evaluation. All data were obtained before and 5, 10, and 15 min following droperidol administration. Baroreflex response was significantly decreased after droperidol at each time of the study with the maximal decrease (-47% from control) observed at 5 min. No resetting of baroreflex was present since the pulse interval at the reference pressure was unchanged. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were moderately but significantly increased only at 5 min, while no significant change in epinephrine concentrations was observed. It is concluded that droperidol induces a moderate but sustained alteration of baroreflex function and a transient increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Differential use-dependent (frequency-dependent) effects in single mammalian axons: data and clinical considerations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The potential clinical scope of use-dependent block of conduction (UDB) was assessed by studying characteristics of UDB in vitro in individual mammalian axons. Single and repetitive stimulation was applied to rabbit cervical sympathetic and vagus nerves exposed to solutions containing lidocaine 0, 0.3, or 0.6 mmol/l (9.1 or 18.2 mg/dl) at 37 degrees C. Unit responses were recorded in dissected filaments or extracellularly in the vagus nodose ganglion. With lidocaine 0.3 mM, equilibrium conduction block, tested by single shocks, was rare. 40-Hz trains produced a significantly greater increase in latency (slowing of conduction) and a much greater incidence of UDB in the sympathetic units than in myelinated vagus axons of equivalent control conduction velocities or in unmyelinated axons. 10-Hz stimulation did not produce UDB. With lidocaine 0.6 mM, the incidence of equilibrium conduction block was too high among sympathetic axons to assess UDB, and significantly higher than among nonsympathetic myelinated and unmyelinated units. The observations support the hypothesis that the differential block of sympathetics observed clinically with spinal anesthesia may be, at least in part, a use-dependent (frequency-dependent) effect. UDB seems unlikely to contribute to local anesthetic block of pain impulses.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Continuous infusion of vecuronium: the effect of anesthetic agents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors studied the effects of enflurane, isoflurane, and fentanyl, each in combination with 60% nitrous oxide, on the vecuronium infusion rate necessary to maintain constant 90% depression of control muscle twitch tension. Thirty healthy surgical patients were given an initial 0.1 mg/kg bolus of vecuronium, followed by an infusion of vecuronium at an initial rate of 1.0 microgram . kg-1 . min-1. After 1 h of steady-state 90% twitch depression, plasma vecuronium concentrations (Css90) were measured by capillary column gas chromatography. Total plasma clearance of vecuronium was estimated using Css90 values. Vecuronium infusion rates (mean +/- SD) were similar for patients given enflurane (0.28 +/- 0.13 microgram . kg-1 . min-1) and isoflurane (0.30 +/- 0.13 microgram . kg-1 . min-1), but significantly higher in patients given fentanyl (0.92 +/- 0.37 microgram . kg-1 . min-1). Values for Css90 in the patients receiving enflurane and isoflurane were similar (71 +/- 34 and 72 +/- 44 ng/ml, respectively), but significantly higher in those receiving fentanyl (165 +/- 48 ng/ml). Total plasma clearance was similar during enflurane, isoflurane, and fentanyl anesthesia (4.4 +/- 2.6, 4.6 +/- 1.2, and 5.6 +/- 1.9 ml X kg-1 min-1, respectively). The authors conclude that patients receiving isoflurane and enflurane require markedly lower vecuronium infusion rates to achieve 90% neuromuscular blockade than those receiving fentanyl. The enhancement of neuromuscular blockade by isoflurane and enflurane represents a change in the pharmacodynamics of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, rather than a change in pharmacokinetics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Isoflurane causes endothelium-dependent inhibition of contractile responses of canine coronary arteries.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The authors sought to determine if isoflurane would attenuate effects of three different types of vasoconstrictors on isolated segments of canine epicardial coronary arteries removed from healthy dogs. As the endothelium has a major role in regulating epicardial coronary artery tone, and as it modulates the effect of many vasoactive substances, experiments were conducted both on normal rings and on rings whose endothelium had been mechanically removed. In addition, the endothelium is thought to be damaged in human atherosclerosis. Rings were suspected in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, aerated with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide, and connected to strain gauges for the measurement of isometric tension. Isoflurane 2.3% (1.5 MAC in the dog) was added to the aerating gas mixture in half the preparations, while the other rings served as control. The vasoconstrictors serotonin, phenylephrine, or prostaglandin F2 alpha were added in increasing concentrations to the bath solution. In the presence of endothelium, vasoconstrictor evoked contractions were attenuated by isoflurane. Maximal tension generated by prostaglandin F2 alpha in untreated rings was 114 +/- 18% (mean +/- SEM) of a reference contraction, while, following isoflurane, it was 46 +/- 8% (P less than 0.005). In the absence of endothelium, isoflurane attenuated neither prostaglandin F2 alpha nor serotonin evoked contraction, and had decreased effectiveness against phenylephrine mediated contraction (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that isoflurane attenuates vasoconstrictor-evoked contraction of isolated canine epicardial coronary arteries, and that this effect is mediated by the endothelium.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The enflurane sparing effect of sufentanil in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- There is a ceiling to the reduction of enflurane MAC by fentanyl in the dog. Sufentanil (SUF), a more potent narcotic, may be more efficacious in reducing enflurane MAC. To test this hypothesis, 25 mongrel dogs were studied in three groups. Group 1 (n = 8) received SUF in progressively increasing infusion rates from 0.005 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 to a maximum of 1.215 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1. MAC was determined at stable SUF concentrations in plasma [SUF] during each infusion rate. Group 2 (n = 10) received SUF at a dose rate (0.007 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) designed to produce approximately 35% MAC reduction, and MAC determinations were made at regular intervals over a mean infusion time of 7.6 +/- 0.43 h (mean +/- SEM). Group 3 (n = 7) received 1.215 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 and were studied as in group 2 over an infusion time of 6.7 +/- 0.42 h. In group 1, the highest infusion rate (1.215 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) produced [SUF] = 48 ng/ml and reduced MAC by 71 +/- 6%. This was not statistically different from the reduction which occurred at [SUF] = 0.92 ng/ml (57 +/- 7%; infusion rate 0.015 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1; P = 0.21). In group 2, the degree of MAC reduction achieved by stable [SUF] (0.54 +/- 0.08 ng/ml) declined over time (MAC reduction at start = 34 +/- 2% versus 18 +/- 4.0% at the end of the infusion; P = 0.001), suggesting the development of tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- High-dose almitrine bismesylate inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in closed-chest dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of almitrine bismesylate on the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor (HPV) response was studied in seven closed-chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital and paralyzed with pancuronium. The right lung was ventilated continuously with 100% O2, while the left lung was ventilated with either 100% O2 ("hyperoxia") or with an hypoxic gas mixture ("hypoxia": end-tidal PO2 = 50.1 +/- 0.1 mmHg). Cardiac output (CO) was altered from a "normal" value of 3.10 +/- 0.18 l . min-1 to a "high" value of 3.92 +/- 0.16 l . min-1 by opening arteriovenous fistulae which allowed measurements of two points along a pressure-flow line. These four phases of left lung hypoxia or hyperoxia with normal and high cardiac output were repeated in the presence and absence of almitrine. Almitrine bismesylate was administered as a constant infusion of 14.3 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1 for a mean plasma concentration of 219.5 +/- 26.4 ng . ml-1. Relative blood flow to each lung was measured with a differential CO2 excretion (VCO2) method corrected for the Haldane effect. With both lungs hyperoxic, the percent left lung blood flow (%QL-VCO2) was 44 +/- 1%. When the left lung was exposed to hypoxia, the %QL-VCO2 decreased significantly to 22 +/- 1%. However, with the administration of almitrine, the %QL-VCO2 during left lung hypoxia increased significantly to 36 +/- 2%. The arterial oxygen tension decreased significantly between hyperoxia (PaO2 = 633 +/- 6 mmHg) and hypoxia (271 +/- 31 mmHg). With the addition of almitrine, there was no change during hyperoxia; however, during hypoxia, the PaO2 decreased significantly to 124 +/- 15 mmHg. Cardiac output did not influence these findings. The pulmonary vascular conductance (G) is the slope of the pressure-flow line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Measurement of lung volume by sulfur hexafluoride washout during spontaneous and controlled ventilation: further development of a method.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- An open circuit tracer gas washout method for measurement of lung volume in patients during anesthesia and intensive care is described and tested. The method employs a device for dispensing the tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a fast SF6 analyzer, a pneumotachograph, and a computer. The dispensing device delivers SF6 into the airway in proportion to instantaneous inspiratory flow so that inspiratory SF6 concentration is held constant, usually at about 0.5%, regardless of the inspiratory flow pattern. The amount of SF6 present in the lungs at the end of a washin is calculated during washout from signals representing expired SF6 concentration and expired flow. From this, lung volume is derived. Accurate and reproducible results were obtained in lung model tests during ventilation with air, N2O in O2, and halothane in O2. Functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured both with SF6 washout and nitrogen washout in five mechanically ventilated patients. This gave the regression equation: FRCSF6 = 10 ml + 1.04 x FRCN2, r = 0.99. A similar close agreement was observed for total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) measurements in eight healthy, spontaneously breathing subjects: TLCSF6 = 91 ml + 1.01 x TLCN2, r = 0.99; RVSF6 = -32 ml + 0.97 x RVN2, r = 0.95. Comparison with body plethysmography in eight healthy, sitting subjects gave the regression equation: FRCSF6 = 180 ml + 0.96 x FRCbox, r = 0.99. The median (range) for the coefficient of variation at duplicate determinations in 10 anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated adults was 3.0% (0.2-6.6%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Accuracy of response of six pulse oximeters to profound hypoxia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Oxygen saturation, SpO2%, was recorded during rapidly induced 42.5 +/- 7.2-s plateaus of profound hypoxia at 40-70% saturation by 1 or 2 pulse oximeters from each of six manufacturers (NE = Nellcor N100, OH = Ohmeda 3700, NO = Novametrix 500 versions 2.2 and 3.3 (revised instrumentation), CR = Criticare CSI 501 + version .27 and version .28 in 501 & 502 (revised instrumentation), PC = PhysioControl Lifestat 1600, and MQ = Marquest/Minolta PulseOx 7). Usually, one probe of each pair was mounted on the ear, the other on a finger. Semi-recumbent, healthy, normotensive, non-smoking caucasian or asian volunteers (age range 18-64 yr) performed the test six to seven times each. After insertion of a radial artery catheter, subjects hyperventilated 3% CO2, 0-5% O2, balance N2. Saturation ScO2, computed on-line from mass spectrometer end-tidal PO2 and PCO2, was used to manually adjust FIO2 breath by breath to obtain a rapid fall to a hypoxic plateau lasting 30-45s, followed by rapid resaturation. Arterial HbO2% (Radiometer OSM-3) sampled near the end of the plateau averaged 55.5 +/- 7.5%. ScO2% (from the mass spectrometer) and SaO2% (from pH and PO2, by Corning 178) differed from HbO2% by + 0.2 +/- 3.6% and 0.4 +/- 2.8%, respectively. The mean and SD errors of pulse oximeters (vs. HbO2%) were: (table; see text) The plateaus were always long enough to permit instruments to demonstrate a plateau with ear probes, but finger probes sometimes failed to provide plateaus in subjects with peripheral vasoconstriction. Nonetheless, SpO2 read significantly too low with finger probes at 55% mean SaO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Prediction of "critical" coronary disease: are the "Consensus Conference" guidelines adequate?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Presenting features of 100 patients with significant left main coronary stenosis (LMCS) were reviewed. All presented with angina--on minimal exertion in 45, moderate exertion in 38, and severe exertion in 6--and 11 had unstable angina. Although the resting ECG was normal in 44, exercise testing was positive in 92% of patients tested. The authors conclude that symptoms and the resting ECG alone are unhelpful in predicting "critical" coronary disease. However, application of a management plan similar to that suggested by the Consensus Conference on coronary artery surgery would have selected the vast majority of such patients for angiography.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Incidence and clinical course of right ventricular infarction: assessment with radionuclide ventriculography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The incidence and prognosis of right ventricular infarction were studied by radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) in 50 consecutive cases of acute myocardial infarction. RNV was performed within thirty-six hours of symptoms and one month after onset. Right ventricular infarction was absent in all 25 patients with anterior infarction. It was found in 15 of the 25 patients with inferior infarction, accompanied by a marked reduction in right ventricular ejection fraction (28 +/- 8%), but was notably alleviated one month later with normalization of right ventricular ejection fraction (39 +/- 7%) and wall motion. These phenomena seem to be specific in right ventricular infarction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evaluation of enzymes in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in cases of cerebrovascular accidents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were measured serially in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 22 patients with fresh stroke and an equal number of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. It was observed that levels of these enzymes in the CSF of control subjects were very low but were significantly elevated (p less than 0.001) in both serum and CSF in patients with stroke. The elevation was greater in the CSF than in the serum and was maximum during the first four days of stroke. Thereafter, the enzymatic activity declined. Of all these enzymes, GGTP in CSF correlated best with the clinical picture. It was possible to differentiate between the ischemic and hemorrhagic type of stroke on the basis of CSF levels of GGTP (greater than 60.0 units in hemorrhagic stroke). There was no correlation between GGTP levels in CSF and serum or among GOT, GPT, and GGTP in CSF. It can be concluded, therefore, that estimation of GGTP in CSF is helpful not only in predicting the degree of cerebral damage and functional outcome of the patient following stroke but also in differentiating the type of stroke.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lower extremity blood flow in intermittent claudication--the role of oral glucose tolerance test.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for peripheral arterial disease. During oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) in a population study the author and co-workers have earlier shown that smokers have higher blood glucose values early postload and lower values at two hours compared with nonsmokers. Eighty-three patients, all with intermittent claudication but with a normal OGTT, have now been studied according to their response to an oral glucose load. The blood flow resistance during reactive hyperemia, as measured with a calf plethysmograph, was compared between subjects in the quartile of patients with the highest forty-five-minute blood glucose and those in the lowest quartile. The blood flow resistance was significantly higher in the group with a high forty-five-minute blood glucose, 13.3 +/- 1.34 vs 9.5 +/- 0.65 (mean +/- SEM), p less than 0.02. Blood pressure and blood lipids were similar in the two groups. It is suggested that an exaggerated early response in the OGTT might be an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Primary lower extremity telangiectasias--relationship of size to color.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sclerotherapy remains the treatment of choice for primary telangiectasias of the lower extremities, a half century after the treatment was first devised. No substantial improvements have been made, largely because little or no attention has been paid to the underlying physiology. Evidence is presented that these vessels are dilated by virtue of their proximity to small arteriovenous communications. This would explain the response these vessels demonstrate when injected with sclerosing solutions, as well as the relationship between their size and their color, which is documented by objective and subjective measurements. Two novel methods of treating telangiectasias with existing sclerosing solutions are described, and the characteristics of an ideal sclerosant for these vessels are proposed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Evaluation of the vasodilator vs inotropic effect of milrinone using an animal model of left ventricular failure: reversal of disopyramide depression of the myocardium with milrinone.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Milrinone (M) has been shown to improve left ventricular (LV) performance in animal and human studies. M has strong vasodilator action, and whether increased LV performance is due primarily to vasodilation or to a direct positive inotropic effect is unclear. Ten mongrel dogs were studied. Disopyramide caused a significant and sustained decrease in LV function and was a good model for myocardial depression. At equal reduction in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), M reversed this LV depression to a significantly greater degree than nitroprusside (NP) did. At equal levels of vasodilation, M produced significantly greater improvement in indices of LV function than NP did in our model of disopyramide-induced LV failure. This suggest that its effect on LV function is not due entirely to afterload reduction, or to reflex sympathetic stimulation, but has a substantial component of direct inotropic stimulation. This study also demonstrated a reversal of disopyramide-induced LV dysfunction by M, which may be clinically useful since, as in many antiarrhythmics, myocardial depression may be a limiting factor in its use.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Atrial pacing during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: results and comparison with exercise treadmill testing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Right atrial pacing (RAP) was used to immediately assess improvement in threshold for myocardial ischemia in 23 patients undergoing angiographically successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Multiple coronary lesions were present in 19 patients, and 15 had incomplete revascularization. All patients had RAP done immediately before and after completion of all dilatations, and in 13 patients pre- and post-PTCA exercise treadmill tests (ETT) were also performed. Angina occurred in 16 (70%) patients during pre-PTCA RAP, but in only 4 (17%) after PTCA (p less than .05). The electrocardiogram was positive for ischemia (horizontal or downsloping ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm) in 18 patients (78%) during pre-PTCA RAP. However, 13 patients (57%) continued to have an ischemic response during post-PTCA RAP (not significant-NS). In 4 patients with multiple coronary lesions who had sequential pacing studies after PTCA of each lesion, the maximum degree of ST depression decreased by 1 mm or more after each dilatation in 3 patients but remained greater than or equal to 1 mm in all. In the 13 patients undergoing both RAP and ETT, angina developed in 7 during pre-PTCA RAP and in 2 after PTCA (p less than .05), compared with 8 and 3 (p less than .05) during pre- and post-PTCA ETT, respectively. Ischemic ST depression occurred in 9 patients during pre-PTCA RAP and in 6 after PTCA (NS), and in 8 and 6 (NS) during pre- and post-PTCA ETT, respectively. Concordance between the two tests was good.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Aortic ejection fraction: a new hemodynamic parameter and its relationship to aortic insufficiency.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pulsations of the ascending aorta during fluoroscopy in patients with aortic insufficiency (AI) have been described. The authors present their observations of a similar phenomenon in patients who have AI undergoing scintiangiography. In addition, this paper describes a technique to validate and quantitate this finding. They studied 17 patients with documented AI and 14 subjects of a control group. First-pass studies were acquired in the RAO 15 degrees projection. Regions of interest were placed over the proximal aorta during systole and diastole. An aortic ejection fraction (AF) was determined. The calculated AEF data were correlated with the presence or absence of AI. The mean AEF from the 17 AI patients was 27.1 +/- 7.2%, while the mean for the non-AI group was 12.0 +/- 6.5% with p less than .001. An AEF of 18% separates the two groups with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 88%, 86%, and 87% respectively. Preliminary data demonstrate a mean reduction in AEF of 12.2 percentage points in 7 AI patients who underwent aortic valve replacement. The AEF may be a useful new parameter to evaluate hemodynamic changes associated with aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic insufficiency.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intermittent claudication associated with cancer--case studies.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Cancer was diagnosed in 15 patients among 300 consecutive patients with intermittent claudication. The cancer-associated claudication is characterized by a more accelerated course of claudication, more often requires vascular surgery, and moreover, the lasting relief of claudication depends upon the efficiency of cancer therapy. It is the authors' impression that cancer-associated claudication is predetermined by atherosclerosis and aggravated by cancer through the chronic hypercoagulability state secondary to neoplasm. The clinical picture is characterized by rapid progression, with the frequent necessity of vascular surgery for limb salvage and a higher incidence of graft occlusion. Awareness of this possibility of hidden malignancy may be related to the clinical picture of hemodynamic deterioration of the underlying arterial insufficiency. A high index of suspicion leads to earlier diagnosis of neoplasm. Effective oncologic therapy will often bring the symptomatic relief of ischemic symptoms in the lower extremities. This report indicates that associated neoplasm has a more vicious course of the underlying arterial insufficiency and intermittent claudication.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific and egg white-specific IgG in 232 children and 42 adults were measured by the RAST method using monoclonal anti-human IgG antibodies (HG2-25) as the secondary antibody. Changes in allergen-specific IgG with the age of the subjects were examined. Allergen-specific IgG antibody in standard serum was designated as 1,000 U/mL. Standard curves were made for each measurement and the levels of allergen-specific IgG of the sera were expressed in units (U). Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific IgG increases from 9 months of age until adulthood. The atopic group showed higher mean values than the non-atopic group (r less than .001). Egg white-specific IgG reaches a peak around 3 to 4 years of age. After this, it declines until adulthood. These results suggest that age factors and allergen factors must be taken into consideration when evaluating allergen-specific IgG antibodies.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long-term IgG4 determinations in hymenoptera-sensitive treated patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Honey bee and vespid venom immunotherapy have been practiced for the past 10 years. Several studies have evaluated the short-term effects of this therapy. The current study evaluated the long-term effects using venom-specific IgG4 determinations. Forty-six patients ranging in age from 3 to 67 years were followed for periods up to 6 1/2 years. All patients included in the study demonstrated Hymenoptera sensitivity on intradermal testing using 0.2 mL of venom extract at concentrations of 0.01 microgram/mL, 0.1 microgram/mL, or 1 microgram/mL. IgE-specific venom antibody levels were tested and found to be elevated. During the first year following institution of venom immunotherapy, 46/46 patients demonstrated an increase in venom-specific IgG4. After the first year of treatment, values reached a plateau. The IgG4 venom-specific antibodies remained relatively constant over the second and third years of the study. Thirty of the 46 patients were followed for more than 3 years. All of the 30, treated greater than 3 years with continuous immunotherapy, demonstrated a gradual decline in IgG4 levels. Despite very low or negligible levels of venom-specific IgG4 antibodies, six patients accidentally stung were still clinically protected. This study suggests that long-term immunity is not mediated in the same manner as that of short-term protection.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The "Asthma Self-Efficacy Scale".</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- According to Bandura, a person's expectations that a favorable outcome will follow a particular behavior are not sufficient to promote the occurrence of the behavior; the person must also believe that he or she will be effective at performing the behavior. The latter is referred to as self-efficacy. It has become a major focus in assessing patient performance of skills required to manage their illness. The present paper describes the development, testing, and applicability of an instrument for assessing self-efficacy in asthmatic patients. It notes that the Asthma Self-Efficacy Scale is not only a reliable paper-and-pencil instrument, but that it has a wide potential applicability throughout health care settings in measuring self-efficacy in asthmatic patients. The Asthma Self-Efficacy Scale is included.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Twenty cases of mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS), from Fall 1984 to April 1986, are included in this study. The serial immunoglobulin levels including IgG, IgA, IgM showed polyclonal increased immunoglobulin levels during the first month. Only one-fourth of patients had high serum IgE levels. There was no correlation with house dust mite antigen skin test and anti-mite IgE levels. By using the polyethylene glycol and ELISA methods, IgE-circulating immune complexes were detectable in 60% of high serum IgE patients. IgG-circulating immune complexes were also detected in 70% by the polyethylene glycol method and 60% by Raji cell method. CH50 and serum properdin factor B level increased during acute febrile phase. Serial T cell subset studies showed OKT4 cells decreased progressively and OKT8 levels were within normal range during the first and second week. By the third week, OKT4 cells increased and OKT8 cells decreased. This progressed to the fifth week and returned to normal range 2 months later. During the acute febrile phase of the first week, Leu2+15+ cells increased and Leu2+15- cells decreased. After the second week, the Leu2+15+ cells decreased and Leu2+15- cells increased. This increase continued to the fifth week when the Leu2+15+ cells were at the lowest level and the Leu2+15- cells at the higher level corresponding to the OKT8 change. After the fifth week, the Leu2+15+ cells and Leu2+15- cells returned to normal. Patients had increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction at the first week of the acute febrile stage. It decreased dramatically in the second week and returned to normal 2 months later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The evaporative cooler (EC) is commonly used during the warmer months in millions of homes in the desert regions of the Southwestern United States. In this investigation fungi isolated from EC homes were compared with recoveries from air conditioned (AC) homes. Aspergillus tamarii was more abundant in EC homes (P less than .05) whereas Penicillium spp. were more prevalent in AC homes (P less than .05). Fusarium was recovered only from EC homes. Overall, more fungi were isolated from EC homes than AC homes both in terms of total numbers of isolates and numbers of species recovered. The EC appears to provide a niche for allergenic fungi that may be transmitted into the home or business.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- CPR in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- CPR has not been well studied in children and little is known about factors predictive of outcome. We conducted a study with three goals: longitudinal determination of demographic and laboratory data characterizing pediatric arrest victims; identification of factor(s) predictive of outcome; and determination of the prevalence of ionized hypocalcemia in pediatric arrest victims. All resuscitation efforts were documented during a one-year period in a 240-bed tertiary care children's hospital. Patients were classified into two groups--respiratory arrest (RA, requiring only assisted ventilation), and cardiac arrest (CA, absence of palpable cardiac activity requiring closed-chest CPR). Collected data and laboratory tests were analyzed using a step-wise discriminant analysis to determine which factors were predictive of outcome. There were 113 arrests in 93 children; 53 were CA victims and 40 were RA victims. CA had a high in-hospital mortality (90.6%) compared to RA (32.5%). The population was young (55% less than 1 year old) and 87% had at least one chronic underlying disease. No laboratory or demographic value was significantly associated with eventual outcome. The number of doses of epinephrine in CA victims, or bicarbonate in RA victims, was associated with eventual outcome. None of 31 CA victims receiving more than two doses of epinephrine survived to discharge. Low ionized calcium concentrations (less than 3.5 mg/dL) were identified in ten patients; septic shock was present in seven, and chronic renal failure in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A survey of participants in a mass CPR training course.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine demographic data and reasons for CPR course taking among 891 participants of a mass CPR training event, a questionnaire was distributed at the time of the course. Of the 728 persons completing this initial survey, 379 (52.6%) were less than 20 years of age. Only 41 (5.6%) took the course because of a family member or close relative with cardiac disease. Of this subgroup, seven (17.1%) had taken a previous CPR course, compared with 25.7% for the entire population. Thirty-eight percent of the 60-and-over age group mentioned cardiac disease as their reason for taking the course, compared to only 2.1% for the under-20 age group. To assess recall and actual performance of CPR, a follow-up survey was mailed to all participants six months after the course. Seventy-two percent were still confident in their ability to perform CPR, although no one had performed the technique on a real victim; 61.9% thought there should have been more manikin practice time; 92.2% still had their CPR refresher card. Only 32.3% would perform CPR on a known AIDS patient. This survey provides demographic and personal data that should be considered when planning future large-scale CPR training programs.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Reinforcing CPR skills without mannequin practice.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied the effectiveness of two refresher methods on skills that did not involve mannequin practice. Sixty-seven Seattle subjects trained one year earlier were pretested and randomly assigned to one of two treatments that covered the technique of one-rescuer CPR: reading a three-page review (n = 33); or viewing a 15-minute videotape (n = 34). Subjects were tested on a recording mannequin immediately after the refresher. Pretest scores were low on almost all skills. After treatment, both groups demonstrated significant improvement (P less than .01), especially on checking the carotid pulse, correct hand position, and ventilation volume. Although students who had watched the tape performed better on compression rate (P less than .05), there was virtually equivalent improvement on the other skills regardless of treatment. Both methods showed promise for reversing skills degradation without mannequin practice.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cervical spine stabilization in pediatric patients: evaluation of current techniques [see comments]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We evaluated the performance of commercially available infant and pediatric cervical collars, both alone and in combination with commonly used supplemental devices (eg, Kendrick Extrication Device, half-spine board). One infant and 11 pediatric-sized collars were tested on mannequins representing an infant and a 5-year old child. Maximum forces generated by cooperative children were measured, then applied to the mannequins to reproduce head and neck flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral motion. Limitation of motion was measured in each direction for each collar and combination method. In general, collars of rigid plastic construction performed better than did foam types. However, when used alone none of the collars provided acceptable immobilization, with even the best allowing 17 degrees flexion, 19 degrees extension, 4 degrees rotation, and 6 degrees lateral motion. When combined with supplemental devices, immobilization to 3 degrees or less in any direction could be achieved. Findings were verified using cooperative children and selected collars. Overall, combination methods were more effective than cervical collars alone (P less than .001) or supplemental devices alone (P less than .05). The modified half-spine board used with a rigid collar and tape was the most effective combination method. We conclude that prehospital cervical spine stabilization in pediatric patients is best accomplished using a rigid-type cervical collar in combination with supplemental devices as described.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A radiographic comparison of prehospital cervical immobilization methods.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Three methods of prehospital cervical immobilization were studied radiographically and compared to the short board technique (SBT). The methods were California Stif-Neck Immobilizing Collar (CSC), Kendrick Extrication Device (KED), and Extrication Plus-One (XP-One). Forty-five volunteers were immobilized in the short board (SB) and one of the test devices studied. Cervical movement in the sagittal and frontal planes was measured radiographically. Movement in the horizontal plane was measured directly. Two-tailed, paired t test analysis was performed comparing test devices to the SBT. The SBT proved to be significantly better (P less than .05) in the following comparisons: the CSC in extension and lateral bending; the KED in lateral bending; and the XP-One in extension. We confirm the SBT as the standard of comparison against which newer prehospital devices can be compared objectively. Of the three devices compared against the SBT, the factory-fabricated short board devices (KED and XP-One) provided the greatest degree of immobilization, in addition to logistical advantages over the SBT.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Enhancement of phenytoin elimination by multiple-dose activated charcoal.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of multiple-dose activated charcoal on the elimination of intravenously administered phenytoin was studied. Seven normal volunteers received phenytoin sodium 15 mg/kg IV with and without activated charcoal. During the charcoal phase, a total dose of 300 g was administered in repeated doses over 48 hours with sufficient sorbitol to produce one to two bowel movements per day. Serum phenytoin concentrations were determined from one to 72 hours after the infusions and were fitted to a one-compartment linear elimination model. The administration of multiple-dose activated charcoal reduced the phenytoin half-life from 44.5 to 22.3 hours. In addition, phenytoin area under the curve was decreased and the elimination rate was increased. Multiple-dose activated charcoal is effective in enhancing the elimination of phenytoin in normal volunteers. Although future studies are needed to determine its role in treating patients with phenytoin toxicity, multiple-dose activated charcoal may provide a readily available, inexpensive therapeutic intervention.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cimetidine protection against alpha-amanitin hepatotoxicity in mice: a potential model for the treatment of Amanita phalloides poisoning.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The ingestion of the mushroom Amanita phalloides is associated with hepatic necrosis appearing clinically two to three days after ingestion. The mechanism of this toxicity is unknown, and no reliable antidote is available. Because of the similarity of Amanita poisoning to other toxins affecting cytochrome P450, we investigated the use of cimetidine (as a P450 cytochrome inhibitor) as an antidote against a primary toxin of the mushroom alpha-amanitin. Mice injected with alpha-amanitin and given cimetidine either prophylactically or within six hours showed histologic protection from the hepatic damage seen in control mice. Control animals displayed significant mitochondrial changes when examined by electron-microscopy, while the mitochondria of the cimetidine-treated animals were preserved, suggesting a possible site for toxin action. Further trials will be necessary before treatment of human cases with cimetidine is indicated.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A comparative study of intraosseous versus peripheral intravenous infusion of diazepam and phenobarbital in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Authors of recent literature have made several references to the use of intraosseous infusion in emergency situations. This method has provided a useful route of medication and fluid administration when peripheral IV access has been unsuccessful. Controlled studies on intraosseous infusion have been limited. To more accurately evaluate the effectiveness of this technique, we administered diazepam to 20 dogs randomly assigned to either peripheral IV (n = 10) or tibial intraosseous (n = 10) groups. Intramedullary placement usually was performed within 15 seconds. Central venous diazepam samples were collected at one-, three-, six-, ten-, and 20-minute intervals. Intraosseous infusion achieved and maintained serum diazepam levels comparable to those achieved by IV administration. This study was repeated with phenobarbital using a different set of 20 dogs with samples collected at one-, three-, six-, and ten-minute intervals. Results were similar in that the levels were comparable regardless of the use of intraosseous or IV administration. Complications using this technique have been few. When peripheral IV access is unobtainable, intraosseous infusion has been shown to be an effective and efficient alternative for administering medications and fluids.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- During a 12-month period, 1,045 of 1,554 patients (67%) over age 30 seen in an urban teaching hospital emergency department with acute chest pain were released based on the clinical judgment of the examining physician. Patients who were released were offered follow-up within 24 to 72 hours in a hospital-based chest pain clinic. Of these 1,045 patients, 772 (74%) returned or were contacted by phone, and 29 were directly admitted; 14 had unstable angina, and eight had new myocardial infarctions. Because of its positive impact on the quality of care at an acceptable cost, the Chest Pain Clinic, which was originally instituted as part of a research protocol, has now become part of the routine spectrum of care provided at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Delayed fatal hyperkalemia in a patient with acute fluoride intoxication.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A 19-year-old man presented with acute fluoride poisoning. Initially his serum electrolytes were normal, but two hours later he developed ECG evidence of hyperkalemia followed by refractory ventricular fibrillation, suggesting that hyperkalemia may be important in the cardiotoxicity of acute fluoride intoxication. Treatment of fluoride-induced hyperkalemia consists of removal of fluoride from the body by dialysis, binding fluoride with aluminum or calcium, or enhancing fluoride excretion by inducing a metabolic alkalosis. Direct treatment of the hyperkalemia with glucose, insulin, and bicarbonate is ineffective. Quinidine may be an effective therapy for the hyperkalemia and ventricular irritability, but is as yet untested in human beings.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Natural course of iron delocalization and lipid peroxidation during the first eight hours following a 15-minute cardiac arrest in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Lipid peroxidation is thought to be a major contributing factor in neurological injury following cardiac arrest. Because iron availability is a prerequisite for lipid peroxidation, this experiment was designed to examine the natural time course of iron release, lipid peroxidation, and cerebral polyunsaturated fatty acid content following a 15-minute cardiac arrest in dogs. Large mongrel dogs were anesthetized with ketamine and halothane and divided into three groups of five each. In two groups, cardiac arrest was induced with KCl. After 15 minutes of cardiac arrest, the dogs were resuscitated by five minutes of internal cardiac massage, epinephrine, bicarbonate, and internal defibrillation. All ten dogs were resuscitated and supported by a standard intensive care protocol until tissue harvest. A 3-g portion of parietal cerebral cortex was obtained from the nonischemic dogs (n = 5), or at two hours (n = 5), or eight hours (n = 5) after resuscitation. Total tissue iron was measured by an atomic emission spectrometer; low molecular weight species (LMWS) iron by the o-phenanthroline test on an ultrafiltered sample; and lipid peroxidation by both the thiobarbituric acid test (TBARS) and determination of the tissue content of lipid double bonds, calculated by first fractionating the lipids by gas-liquid chromatography and then measuring the double bonds in each fraction by spectrometry and summing the results. Univariate ANOVA demonstrated all variables except total tissue iron to have significance at P less than .02. At two hours of reperfusion, LMWS iron and TBARS were significantly elevated above nonischemic control levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Impact of drug screening in suspected overdose.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied how emergency qualitative drug screens were ordered and used during the evaluation of 405 consecutive adult patients presenting to a metropolitan emergency department with suspected drug intoxication. Physicians completed a two-part questionnaire outlining diagnosis, diagnostic certainty, suspected drug(s), and management plans immediately following initial evaluation and again at the time of ED disposition. Screen results were reviewed prior to ED disposition in 361 (89%) cases. We found that qualitative drug screens were associated with substantial changes in diagnostic certainty, as measured by changes in probability estimates and changes in absolute mean log-likelihood ratios. In 196 cases for which all data were recorded prospectively, drug screens excluded a diagnosis of drug intoxication or specifically suspected drugs in 81 cases (41%), but identified previously unsuspected drugs in only 21 cases (11%, P less than .001). Management changes followed qualitative drug screen results in 16 of 361 cases overall (4.4%), but seven of these were also associated with diagnostic quantitative serum drug levels. Potentially critical interventions were begun in two cases following positive screens but delayed in another due to a falsely negative screen. Guidelines for more efficient test utilization are proposed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Cimetidine toxicity: an assessment of 881 cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We reviewed 881 documented cimetidine overdoses. The data were compiled and analyzed retrospectively from 2,612,236 poisoning cases reported to two nationwide poison surveillance systems from 1978 through 1985. Only cases of cimetidine exposures without coingestants were included. Age, sex, symptom occurrence, treatment site, reason and route of exposure, and medical outcome data were evaluated. Eight hundred eighty-one cases met the criteria and were analyzed. Children between 12 and 35 months of age accounted for 43% of the cases and 97% of all exposures were acute. Intentional overdosage accounted for 21%; 76% were accidental in nature. Gastric emptying was performed in 34%. No symptoms were observed in 79% of the cases, which included ingestions of up to 15 g of cimetidine. Only three patients had moderate clinical manifestations. No patients had major medical complications and there were no fatalities. Even patients in the moderate category experienced no life-threatening toxic manifestations. Cimetidine appears to have an extremely high therapeutic index in both children and adults and demonstrates a remarkable safety profile following acute overdose.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of gastric lavage and thoracic cavity lavage in the treatment of severe hypothermia in dogs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A study was undertaken to compare warm gastric (Group 1) and closed thoracic cavity (Group 2) lavage for rewarming severely hypothermic dogs. Adult mongrel dogs were monitored by intra-arterial catheter, central venous catheter, and ECG, and by central venous, esophageal, and rectal temperature probes. Animals were externally cooled to an average of 21.2 C using ice bags. Eight Group 1 and eight Group 2 animals underwent continuous warm saline gastric or closed thoracic cavity lavage, respectively, using afferent and efferent nasogastric and thoracostomy tubes. No animal suffered ventricular fibrillation during tube placement. The closed lavage system consisted of a high-efficiency heat exchanger, a roller pump infusion device, and a heat exchange fluid bath. The lavage fluid circulated at a flow rate of 550 mL/min and a temperature of 39 C. Thoracic lavage animals were followed clinically for 24 hours for evidence of complications, then euthanized and autopsied. The mean time required to rewarm the animals 10 C by central venous temperature probe was 210.9 +/- 18.6 minutes for the gastric group and 99.3 +/- 23.0 minutes for the thoracic group (P less than .001). Rectal temperature consistently lagged behind central venous temperature during both the cooling and rewarming phases in both treatment groups. All of the thoracic lavage animals made an uneventful recovery. Continuous warm saline thoracic cavity lavage for core rewarming of severely hypothermic dogs is more effective than gastric lavage, and appears to be safe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of dichloroacetate administration during fatal hemorrhagic shock in immature swine [published erratum appears in Ann Emerg Med 1988 Jan;17(1):143]</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- During hemorrhagic shock, decreased perfusion and poor tissue oxygenation lead to increased lactate production. Previous animal studies have suggested that sodium dichloroacetate (DCA), an agent that decreases lactate production, can improve hemodynamics and survival when administered after severe hemorrhage. We used an unanesthetized porcine hemorrhagic shock model to assess the effect of DCA on survival time when administered during fatal hemorrhage. Immature female swine weighing 14 to 20 kg were splenectomized and instrumented with chronic indwelling aortic and right atrial catheters one week prior to hemorrhage. On the day of the experiment, the unanesthetized animals' aortic catheter was connected to a roller pump and blood was removed at a rate of 1.0 mL/kg/min until death occurred. Experimental animals (n = 8) received sodium dichloroacetate (25 mg/mL distilled water) 100 mg/kg IV bolus beginning 15 minutes after the start of hemorrhage followed by a 3 mg/kg/min constant IV infusion. Control animals (n = 8) received an equal volume of normal saline. Arterial pressure, heart rate, blood gases, serum lactate, and serum glucose were measured at baseline and every 15 minutes during hemorrhage. There were no significant differences in survival time (controls, 63 +/- 2.8 min; DCA-treated, 60 +/- 3.7 min), lactate levels, or blood pressures between the two groups. These results suggest that DCA does not decrease serum lactate or improve survival time when administered during ongoing severe hemorrhagic shock. Further study should be directed at the effects of DCA as an adjunctive treatment after hemorrhage has been controlled and tissue perfusion restored.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Accuracy of urine urobilinogen and bilirubin assays in predicting liver function test abnormalities.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Components of the dipstick urinalysis (urine urobilinogen and urine bilirubin) are often used by emergency physicians to screen for the need to obtain liver function tests in many clinical situations. A prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive properties of spot urine bilirubin and urobilinogen assays in the emergency department as screening test for serum liver function test (LFT) abnormalities. Of 122 patients, abdominal pain was the indication for laboratory evaluation in 54%; jaundice and constitutional symptoms were the indication in 29%. Overall sensitivities for both urine assays were 70% to 74% for serum bilirubin, but 43% to 53% for other LFTs; specificities were 77% to 87% for both urine screens. Positive predictive values show that the urine assays were 83% to 86% reliable for detecting at least one LFT abnormality. Negative predictive values were 85% for both urine assays for serum bilirubin elevations, but lower for other LFTs. Urine urobilinogen has its greatest clinical utility as a screen when a normal/abnormal threshold of 2.0/4.0 mg/dL is used.</ABSTRACT>

- A prospective study was designed to evaluate the reliability of excretory urography (EU) in excluding renal damage in patients with blunt abdominal trauma, using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) as the "gold standard" of diagnostic studies. Sixty patients with indications for genitourinary evaluation and with normal EU underwent CECT. Five renal injuries were demonstrated by CECT in patients with negative EU: one contusion, one subcapsular hematoma, two perirenal hematomas, and one renal laceration. All of these lesions resolved with conservative patient management. Thus, the CECT findings did not alter treatment in these five patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Basic trauma life support.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The impact of traumatic injuries on modern society in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic cost is enormous. Studies have shown that both advanced life support skills and rapid stabilization and transport of the trauma victim have a beneficial effect on the patient's ultimate outcome. The Basic Trauma Life Support (BTLS) course was designed to provide pre-hospital care providers with the skills necessary to provide a thorough assessment, initial resuscitation, and rapid transportation of the trauma victim. Early studies suggest that the material is easily learned by prehospital care providers and that the on-scene time for trauma cases is reduced following training in BTLS. More widespread training in BTLS may have a significant effect on the mortality and morbidity associated with traumatic injuries.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Time study of patient movement through the emergency department: sources of delay in relation to patient acuity.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A continuous observation time study was used to track 1,568 patients through various stages of emergency department care in order to identify sources of delay. Patients initially were assigned to one of four categories of decreasing acuity, and flow profiles were compared for each category. Patients with lowest acuity level experienced long delays in moving through the ED, although the actual evaluation and treatment time was brief. Urinalyses, procedures, radiographs, and blood tests had an increasing impact on treatment times (45 minutes, 63 minutes, 65 minutes, and 126 minutes, respectively, compared to 31 minutes with no tests or procedures). Patients of increasing acuity moved more quickly, but with a longer evaluation and treatment time. The most critical patients moved most quickly but with a brief evaluation and treatment time due to a rapid disposition from the ED or death. This relationship suggests an emergency care system that is oriented toward the efficient care of high-acuity patients but that is less effective for low-acuity patients. This occurs despite the fact that low-acuity patients comprise the vast majority of the ED census, and represent a group for whom delay is a frequent source of patient dissatisfaction.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of four ankle splint designs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Plaster splinting is often considered the initial immobilization method for acute ankle injuries. Although the posterior splint design is most commonly recommended, clinical experience suggests that it is not the most durable in the outpatient setting. To determine the sturdiness of the four most common splint designs, each was tested for its resistance to plantar flexion 30 minutes after application. The splints tested were: standard posterior, ridged posterior, modified figure-of-eight, and sugar-tong. In six healthy subjects, significantly less plantar flexion was achieved with the sugar-tong splint than with the other designs. In addition, more force was generated per degree of plantar flexion achieved with the sugar-tong than with the other designs. These results suggest that the sugar-tong splint may be preferred in the acute treatment of ankle injuries based on its greater strength.</ABSTRACT>

It was determined that the patient had decompression sickness ("the bends") of the right shoulder and pulmonary barotrauma resulting in secondary pneumoperitoneum. He underwent decompression, with prompt resolution of symptoms. Of the 14 cases of isolated pneumoperitoneum due to barotrauma reported in the world literature, three were due to gastric rupture. Shoulder pain in association with pneumoperitoneum may be due to diaphragmatic irritation or may be an isolated symptom of decompression sickness.

Despite characteristic neurological findings, the diagnosis was delayed due to the absence of history of penetrating spinal trauma and incorrect attribution of unilateral-like weakness and numbness to lumbosacral trauma. A directed history and examination revealed that the patient was stabbed in the back with a penknife while leaving a bus and stepped down onto a paralyzed leg, which collapsed beneath him. The patient was given an antibiotic, underwent a negative peritoneal lavage, and had myelography and nerve conduction velocity confirmatory for Brown-Sequard syndrome.

<ABSTRACT>
- We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with acute pulmonary edema secondary to the administration of naloxone to reverse an inadvertent narcotic overdose. The patient presented following a 12-hour history of increasingly bizarre behavior and confusion. A total IV dose of 1.6 mg naloxone was administered in an attempt to reverse the suspected overconsumption of a codeine-containing cough suppressant. She immediately became agitated, tachycardic, and diaphoretic; a clinical diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema was made. Following treatment with furosemide, nitroglycerin, and morphine sulfate, the patient recovered completely without further incident. Although naloxone is thought to be a safe drug with few complications, it should not be used indiscriminantly, and the smallest doses necessary to elicit the desired response should be used.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The maintenance of total ventilatory requirements through a chronic bronchopleural cutaneous fistula.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In patient with a chronic post-tuberculous bronchopleural cutaneous fistula (BPCF), minute ventilation, dead space, flow rates, arterial blood gas tensions, and oxygen consumption were measured during mouth breathing and after 30 min of steady-state breathing solely through the BPCF. Despite a 390-ml (18%) decrease in dead space when breathing took place through the BPCF, there were no significant changes in minute ventilation or respiratory rate. BPCF breathing was also associated with an increase in airways resistance as reflected by a 300-ml (35%) decrease in the FEV1 and a 16% decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio. The increased resistance resulted in a 20 ml/min (18%) increase in oxygen consumption. Arterial blood gas tensions remained constant. We conclude that although ventilatory efficiency was not improved, this patient was able to satisfy his total minute ventilatory requirements, for the 30-min period, solely through BPCF breathing.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lower respiratory tract abnormalities in rheumatoid interstitial lung disease. Potential role of neutrophils in lung injury.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Although the etiology of rheumatoid interstitial lung disease (RILD) remains unknown, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been useful in studying potentially pathogenic mechanisms in this disorder. Previous investigations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and RILD revealed abnormal BAL T-lymphocyte subpopulations and a significant elevation in BAL neutrophils. Because neutrophils have been implicated as important effector cells in inflammatory disorders such as ARDS and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we evaluated BAL fluid in patients with RA for neutrophil chemotactic and activating properties and for evidence of neutrophil activation. The BAL fluid from patients with RILD contained significant neutrophil chemotactic activity derived from both lipid and nonlipid components. Evidence for neutrophil stimulation in the lower respiratory tract of patients with RILD was suggested by elevations in both myeloperoxidase activity and immunologically determined levels of human neutrophil elastase in BAL fluid. Free uninhibited elastolytic activity, however, was not demonstrated, suggesting that adequate protease inhibitor levels were present to inhibit active elastase activity. In addition to elevated myeloperoxidase activity, a potential role for neutrophil-derived oxidant injury was indirectly suggested by the enhanced release of superoxide anion (O2-) from resting normal human blood neutrophils challenged with concentrated BAL fluid from patients with RA and interstitial lung disease. Significant correlations were found between physiologic parameters and the percentage of BAL neutrophils, as well as levels of neutrophil-derived mediators. For example, levels of human neutrophil elastase were strongly correlated with diminished diffusion capacity (r = -0.73, p less than 0.001) and reduced forced vital capacity (r = -0.63, p less than 0.006).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mechanisms of changes in nitrogen washout and lung volumes after saline infusion in humans.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This study was performed to determine the roles of increased intrathoracic blood volume and increased vagal tone in the changes in lung volume and nitrogen washout produced by saline infusion. In the first study, measurements of TLC, VC, FRC, ERV, and slope of phase III nitrogen washout (delta N2) were made on 8 subjects before, during, and after inflation of the leg compartments of medical anti-shock trousers (MAST). In the second study, 13 volunteers were infused intravenously with warm saline (30 ml/kg) for 30 min. Repeat measurements were made approximately 20 and 40 min after infusion. Each subject then received intravenously 0.03 mg/kg atropine, and measurements were repeated. In 7 of these subjects, a third study was performed in which the atropine was injected before saline infusion. Inflation of the MAST (see figures 5 and 6) caused a 1.9% decrease in VC, 5.3% decrease in FRC, and no change in delta N2. Saline infusion caused decreases in TLC, VC, and FRC (4.0, 3.1, and 10.1%, respectively) and a 15.0% increase in delta N2. Atropine reversed the change in delta N2 after saline infusion and prevented these changes when given prior to saline. Atropine had no effect on lung volumes whether given before or after saline infusion. We speculate from our data that saline infusion has 2 effects on the lung. One is a simple displacement of air by increased intravascular volume producing the reduction in lung volumes. The second is an increase in small airways resistance that is mediated by vagal reflex and blocked with atropine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effect of effort on measurement of forced expiratory volume in one second.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The American Thoracic Society recommends that the largest FEV1 be reported from a set of forced expiratory vital capacity maneuvers performed with maximal expiratory effort. However, increased expiratory effort can decrease the FEV1. When we evaluated the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in 5 normal subjects, measured from flow-volume curves, as a noninvasive index of expiratory effort, it was positively correlated with indices of effort obtained by using an esophageal balloon. We then measured the difference (dFEV1)between the largest FEV1 and FEV1 from the maneuver with the highest PEFR during 10 test sessions in 10 normal subjects. Thus, dFEV1 was always greater than or equal to 0. The mean dFEV1 was 110 ml for all sessions but decreased to 80 ml when maneuvers with poorly reproducible PEFR or forced expiratory vital capacity values were discarded. We also reviewed 9.471 spirometry sessions from outpatients and found dFEV1 to be greater than 50 ml in 26% of this population and greater than 151 ml in 7%. We concluded that during standard spirometry, FEV1 is inversely dependent on effort. Maximal effort decreases FEV1 because of the effect of thoracic gas compression on lung volume. We recommend that values from spirometry maneuvers that demonstrate submaximal effort, indicated by a decreased PEFR, be discarded. The flow-volume curve display of superimposed efforts facilitates the recognition of submaximal efforts.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Assessment of the usefulness of helium-oxygen maximal expiratory flow curves in epidemiologic studies of lung disease in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Density dependence of maximal expiratory air flow (DD) has been used in adults as a test of early obstructive airway disease (OAD). Whether DD is useful as an epidemiologic tool to identify childhood risk factors for OAD is not known. In a population-based sample of 133 children 8 to 23 yr of age, we calculated density dependence at 50 and 25% of vital capacity (DD50 and DD25) (the ratios between maximal expiratory flow rates breathing helium-oxygen and air gas mixtures at each of these lung volumes), and the volume of isoflow (VisoV) (the lung volume, expressed as a percentage of vital capacity, at which maximal flow rates when breathing each gas mixture are equal), measured airway responsiveness using eucapnic hyperventilation with cold air, and obtained health and household information with questionnaires. Mean levels (+/- SD) of DD50, DD25, and VisoV were: 1.49 +/- 0.14, 1.37 +/- 0.18, and 10.7 +/- 10%. The DD50 significantly increased with age in these growing children (p less than 0.05), but DD50 was found to be significantly lower (1.42 +/- 0.14 versus 1.52 +/- 0.13; p less than 0.01) among children with nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The DD50 also was significantly reduced among children with a history of a recent upper respiratory tract illness (URI) (p less than 0.01). There were no significant associations of DD with history of asthma, personal smoking, parental smoking, or respiratory illness during infancy. The reproducibility of DD50 was assessed on a subsample of 90 subjects in whom DD was measured during 2 surveys 1 yr apart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of milrinone on contractility of the rat diaphragm in vitro.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We studied the effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, milrinone, on isometric force production in the isolated, directly stimulated rat diaphragm. Milrinone (500 micrograms/ml) significantly increased force during twitch stimulation and submaximal tetanic stimulation (p less than 0.05); force during maximal tetanic stimulation was significantly reduced by milrinone (p less than 0.05). The force-augmenting effects of milrinone were not abolished by pretreatment with indomethacin (10(-5)M). Baseline force production decreased when diaphragmatic strips were placed in a calcium-free bathing solution; force potentiation by milrinone, however, persisted in this medium. Pretreatment with milrinone more than doubled the mean time to fatigue (10.8 +/- 1.0 versus 5.1 +/- 0.6 min) during repetitive submaximal stimulation (p less than 0.01). In diaphragmatic strips fatigued by repetitive submaximal stimulation until force production was 60% of baseline, milrinone promptly improved force production; the magnitude of force potentiation after milrinone was quite similar in fresh and fatigued muscle. In conclusion, milrinone enhances diaphragmatic contractility during the most forms of direct stimulation, and delays and reverses diaphragmatic fatigue.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Clinical significance of sleep apnea in the elderly.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The generally accepted polysomnographic criteria for diagnosis of sleep apnea is exceeded by elderly subjects with such frequency that the validity of its application to this age group has been questioned. We studied a group of elderly volunteers with nocturnal polysomnography and partitioned them into 2 groups based upon an apnea index of greater than or less than 5 per hour. The results of a protocol evaluating the presence of potential complications of sleep apnea including cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension, cor pulmonale, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive impairment were compared for the 2 groups. No excess incidence of cardiovascular complications was found. Although an increase in daytime sleep tendency was shown for the group with more frequent apneas, no appreciable deficits in cognitive performance were demonstrated. Although apnea during sleep in the elderly may be associated with an increase in daytime sleepiness, it may not necessarily result in other physiologic or neuropsychologic consequences. Therapeutic intervention for these abnormalities should be carefully considered prior to the institution of treatment in light of these observations.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ambulatory evaluation of sleep disturbance and therapeutic effects in sleep apnea syndrome by wrist activity monitoring.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A new wrist actometer was used to obtain ambulatory activity-rest recordings in 18 patients with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) and in 22 control subjects. A movement index (MI) and a fragmentation index (FI) during sleep time were computed, giving an estimate of the stability of sleep. In control subjects, we observed a clear differentiation between night and day activity levels. The distribution of MI and FI was very narrow, with a mean +/- SD of 13.9 +/- 5.4 and 16.1 +/- 5.8%. No correlation of MI and FI with body mass index, even in heavily obese subjects, was found; MI and FI decrease significantly with age. A diagnosis of SAS was made by standard all-night polysomnography. Patients with SAS had a significantly higher MI and FI than did control subjects (p less than 0.001). With respect to polysomnographic diagnosis of SAS, the sensitivity of activity recordings was 89%, whereas the specificity was 95%. Five patients were studied after treatment, and decreases in MI and FI at home were in good agreement with the improvement in their sleep as assessed clinically and by polysomnography. We conclude that this technique is useful for an objective measurement of sleep restlessness and fragmentation, and for a simple evaluation of therapeutic effects under real life conditions in SAS.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Mild emphysema is associated with reduced elastic recoil and increased lung size but not with air-flow limitation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Thirty-nine excised human lungs were examined to identify early changes in the small airways, their size distribution, and their elastic recoil in relation to mild degrees of emphysema. Elastic recoil measurement, single-breath nitrogen (SBN2) tests, and FEV1 were obtained from 18 lungs with no emphysema and 21 emphysematous lungs with no greater than Grade 5 emphysema score. The mean number of alveolar attachments per brochiole was determined from all the bronchioles cut in cross section. When the 2 groups of lungs were compared, the percentage of predicted elastic recoil of the nonemphysematous lungs was significantly greater at 50, 70, 80, and 90% of TLC than in the mildly emphysematous lungs. The TLC of the emphysematous lungs (% of predicted) was also significantly greater than in the nonemphysematous lungs. Pigment of the small airways was the only pathologic feature that was significantly greater in the emphysematous lungs than in the nonemphysematous lungs. Size distribution in the small airways was similar except for the airways zero to 0.2 mm, which were more frequent in the emphysematous lungs. When data from both groups were combined, elastic recoil was shown to be related to both the number of alveolar attachments (p less than 0.03) and the mean diameter of the small airways (p less than 0.01). We conclude that structural and functional changes in lungs with mild emphysema include reduced elastic recoil, increased lung size, and some size distribution changes in the small airways. Mild emphysema is not associated with air-flow limitation.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effects of ventilatory pattern on hyperinflation, airway pressures, and circulation in mechanical ventilation of patients with severe air-flow obstruction.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Patients with severe air-flow obstruction receiving mechanical ventilation are at risk of inadvertent pulmonary hyperinflation with morbidity and mortality caused by pneumothorax and circulatory depression. Nine patients with severe air-flow obstruction (5 asthma, 4 chronic air-flow obstruction) requiring mechanical ventilation were studied while sedated and therapeutically paralyzed. Pulmonary hyperinflation during steady-state ventilation was quantified by measuring total exhaled volume during 20- to 40-s apnea (end-inspiratory lung volume, VEI). Patients were studied at 3 levels of minute ventilation (VE) (10, 16, and 26 L/min) and at each VE, 3 levels of tidal volume (VT) (0.6, 1.0, and 1.6 L) and 3 levels of inspiratory flow (VI) (40, 70, and 100 L/min for VT = 1.0 L). There were progressive increases in VEI when VT was increased or when expiratory time (TE) was decreased either by an increase in rate (and hence VE) or by a decrease in VI (at a constant VE) reaching lung volumes as high as 3.6 +/- 0.4 L above FRC. Alveolar, central venous, and esophageal pressure rose in parallel with lung volumes, and hypotension was seen in most patients at highest lung volumes. Peak airway pressure (Ppk) was predominantly related to inspiratory flow and did not reflect changes in lung volume. Levels of ventilation required for normocapnia prior to paralysis (15.7 +/- 2.3 L/min) were associated with hypotension in 7 patients and probable hyperinflation in excess of 1.96 +/- 0.17 L above FRC. VEI is a simple, reproducible measurement of pulmonary hyperinflation and may be more important than Ppk in the causation of barotrauma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Quantitation of cellular and extracellular constituents of the pulmonary lining in rats by using bronchoalveolar lavage. Effects of silica-induced pulmonary inflammation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The efficacy of bronchoalveolar lavage in the removal of cellular and extracellular components of the lining layer from the lungs of silica-treated and control rats was determined. Exponential functions were fitted to curves generated by plotting the quantity of lining layer constituent removed from the lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage versus the lavage number. From these exponential functions we determined the total amount of constituent available in the pulmonary extracellular lining and hence the efficacy of the lavage procedure in removing materials from the lungs. With control rats the removal of extracellular phospholipids, soluble protein, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase by bronchoalveolar lavage occurred at significantly different rates. Removal of 95% of the total available extracellular phospholipid, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, soluble protein, and alkaline phosphatase from the lungs required 4, 4, 8, and 11 lavages, respectively. Removal of 95% of the total available alveolar macrophages required 18 lavages. The influence of pulmonary inflammation on the efficacy of the lavage procedure was investigated by injecting silica dust intratracheally into the lungs of rats (50 mg/200- to 250-g rat) and after 3 days performing the analyses. Silica caused an inflammatory condition in the lungs resulting in the accumulation of materials in the alveoli. Highly significant increases in soluble protein (16-fold), alkaline phosphatase (9-fold), and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (11-fold), polymorphonuclear leukocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes were observed. Alveolar macrophages and extracellular phospholipid were not significantly elevated at 3 days after dosing. Silica did not alter the efficacy of the lavage procedure in removing from the lungs any of the extracellular constituents of the lung lining.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Changes in autacoid and neuropeptide contents of lung cells in asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to determine if asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the rat can affect the levels of autacoids and peptides in freshly isolated lung cells. Lung fibrosis was experimentally induced in rats by a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg UICC Canadian chrysotile B fibers. Isolated lung cells were prepared from normal and from asbestos-exposed rats. These cells were also fractionated on bovine serum albumin (BSA) gradients. The contents of serotonin (5-HT), histamine (HIST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and bombesin (BN) were measured in isolated total cell preparations as well as in density-fractionated cell populations from normal and from asbestos-exposed rats. Analysis of total lung cell preparation showed the presence of heterogeneous populations in normal rat lung. After asbestos exposure, there were significant changes in these cell populations as evidenced by significant increases in lymphocyte and mast cell numbers. In addition, increased levels of 5-HT, HIST, and VIP were observed in isolated lung cells obtained from rats exposed to asbestos 1, 3, and 6 months after instillation. BN content was unchanged 3 months after treatment, but was significantly increased at the 6 month-interval, suggesting a different pattern of response for this neuropeptide. Density fractionation of various cell populations further showed selective changes in specific cell fractions of lung after asbestos exposure. At 6 months, increased levels of 5-HT, HIST, and VIP were associated with cell fraction 7, whereas changes in BN content were found in cell fractions 2 and 3. Similarly, there was a significant increase of mast cells in fraction 7 at the 6-month interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Bronchoalveolar lavage and histologic characterization of late asthmatic response in guinea pigs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To elucidate the mechanisms of late asthmatic response (LAR) observed in asthmatic subjects, we have developed an animal model of LAR using guinea pigs. Fifty guinea pigs were immunized with a mixture of Ascaris suum extract and aluminum hydroxide and then challenged with an inhalation of Ascaris suum extract without anesthesia. Twenty of the 50 guinea pigs showed a dual asthmatic response in which the LAR occurred 3 to 6 h after immediate asthmatic response (IAR). Histologic studies by rapid freezing with liquid nitrogen or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in 14 of these 20 guinea pigs with LAR and compared with those in 10 of 18 guinea pigs with only IAR, 10 control guinea pigs, and 10 nonimmunized but challenged guinea pigs. Both the percentage and the absolute number of neutrophils in the BAL fluid of the guinea pigs with LAR were significantly greater than those of the control guinea pigs (p less than 0.02) and than those of the nonimmunized but challenged guinea pigs (p less than 0.02). However, that of guinea pigs with LAR was not significantly different from that of guinea pigs with only IAR. On the other hand, histologic examination showed that eosinophil infiltration within the airway walls of the guinea pigs with LAR was more prominent than that of the guinea pigs with only IAR, and showed that there was no significant difference in neutrophil infiltration within the airway walls between the guinea pigs with LAR and the animals with only IAR. Contraction of airway (bronchus, bronchiole) smooth muscle, submucosal edema, and mucus in airway lumen were also observed in LAR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lysophosphatidylcholine augments elastase-induced alveolar epithelial permeability and emphysema in the hamster.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We administered low dose porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) with and without lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), a naturally occurring constituent of lung lipids with known membrane-perturbing properties, to test the hypothesis that alveolar epithelial solute permeability is a determinant of the severity of elastase-induced emphysema in experimental animals. Four age- and weight-matched groups of hamsters received intratracheal injections of one of the following in a total volume of 0.5 ml TRIS buffered saline: (1) no additions, (2) 4 units PPE, (3) 135 micrograms lysoPC, or (4) 4 units PPE plus 135 micrograms lysoPC. Thirty minutes later the permeability surface area products (PS) of the alveolar epithelium to 14C-sucrose and 125I-dextran 70 were measured in excised, perfused lungs from some animals from each group. The remaining animals were killed at 6 wk, at which time pressure-volume relationships were measured in excised lungs, and the mean linear intercept was determined from sections of fixed lung tissue. Neither PPE nor lysoPC alone caused statistically significant increases in PS for either tracer. The PPE plus lysoPC caused statistically insignificant increases in sucrose PS but approximate tenfold increases in dextran 70 PS, which were highly significant (p less than 0.001). Although focal air-space enlargement was observed in some lungs 6 wk after exposure to PPE, pressure-volume relationships and mean linear intercepts were not significantly different from control values. Lungs previously exposed to lysoPC were indistinguishable from control lungs for all measurements. Severe emphysema was uniformly observed in animals that received PPE in combination with lysoPC; lysoPC had no demonstrable effect upon PPE-induced hydrolysis of native elastin in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Hypoplasia and immaturity of the terminal lung unit (acinus) in congenital diaphragmatic hernia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We assessed the maturity of the lungs and the radial count in 10 infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who died in the immediate perinatal period. The lungs were all immature, with a histologic appearance of less than stated gestational age. The ipsilateral lungs were less mature in appearance than were the contralateral ones. The radial count, an assessment of acinar complexity, was reduced in all cases, and once again the ipsilateral lung was more affected. We present evidence that, in 4 of 6 lungs, volumes were more reduced than predicted from the radial count, and this may be due to loss of (airway) units. We have discussed the controversy about the appearance of the acinus in diaphragmatic hernia and present reasons to explain this. Hyaline membrane disease often occurs in diaphragmatic hernia, even at full term. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage is a common complication of diaphragmatic hernia.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Distribution of proteins in pulmonary edema. The value of fractional concentrations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pulmonary edema fluid (PEF) and serum (S) were obtained from 14 patients with cardiac pulmonary edema (CPE) and 25 noncardiac pulmonary edema (NCPE) patients. The type of pulmonary edema was based on a clinical classification. The protein content of PEF was not significantly different between CPE (3.89 +/- 0.25 g/dl, mean +/- SEM) and NCPE (4.35 +/- 0.34 g/dl) patients, but the protein content of serum was different (7.18 +/- 0.27 versus 5.13 +/- 0.23, respectively, p less than 0.001). As expected then, the PEF/S ratio was greater in NCPE than in CPE (0.85 +/- 0.06 versus 0.54 +/- 0.03, respectively, p less than 0.05). Thus, differences in the PEF/S ratios in CPE as compared with those in NCPE are independent of mean edema fluid protein content and dependent on differences in serum protein content. PEF and S proteins were separated into 9 fractions of increasing molecular radius by electrophoresis, and fractional concentrations (percent of total protein content) were calculated. The fractional concentrations of these combined fractions of serum proteins were not different between CPE and NCPE. Fractional PEF/S ratios were significantly greater for combined fractions I-III (p less than 0.01) in CPE than in NCPE and significantly less in fractions VII-IX (p less than 0.01). In CPE, a higher percentage of proteins with smaller molecular radii (45 A) enter the airway compartment in part because of higher hydrostatic pressures, whereas in NCPE, larger proteins enter the airways consequent to increased permeability to proteins with molecular radii greater than 72 A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Arachidonic acid lipoxygenase pathways and increased vascular permeability in isolated rabbit lungs.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Products of arachidonic acid (AA) pathways have repeatedly been implicated in acute lung vascular injury with respiratory distress. In blood-free perfused isolated rabbit lungs, AA endogenously released or exogenously applied causes an acute pressor response, mediated by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway including thromboxane A2. Moreover, bolus application of AA (final concentration, 100 microM in the recirculating buffer) during an acute hydrostatic challenge was recently noted to cause a rapid, severalfold increase in the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c), though any significant rise in pulmonary vascular pressure was inhibited by indomethacin. In the present study, we showed that during this mode of AA bolus application in cell-free perfused rabbit lungs, microgram amounts of peptidoleukotrienes (LTE4 greater than LTC4 greater than LTD4) and LTB4 were released into the recirculating buffer within 5 min and continued to be released even after 2 exchanges of the perfusion fluid. In the presence of 2 structurally unrelated lipoxygenase inhibitors (nordihydroguaiaretic acid and AA-861), the leukotriene release was nearly completely inhibited and the AA-induced severe increase in vascular permeability was significantly reduced (2.5- to 3-fold rise in Kf,c, compared to a greater than 10-fold increase in Kf,c in the absence of lipoxygenase inhibition). Exogenous LTC4 caused a dose-dependent, sustained pressure rise in protein-free perfused lungs, apparently mediated via the pulmonary generation of AA cyclooxygenase products. Bolus application of 10 micrograms LTC4 or LTD4 or 7.5 micrograms LTB4 in protein-free perfused lungs during an acute hydrostatic challenge did not, however, mimic the AA bolus-induced severalfold increase in vascular permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The relationship between exercise-induced asthma and plasma catecholamines.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In asthmatics, exercise (E1) is known to induce bronchoconstriction; a second period of exercise (E2) within 30 to 90 min induces a lesser degree of bronchoconstriction. The reason for the "refractory" bronchoconstrictor response to E2 is unclear. We studied 6 normal subjects (Group 1) and 12 stable asthmatics to examine the possible relationship between the refractory period and sympathoadrenal function. The asthmatics were further divided into 2 groups, based on the absence (Group 2, n = 5) or presence (Group 3) of an exercise-induced bronchoconstrictor response. In each subject/patient, after control measurements of spirometry and venous blood sampling, a standard level of treadmill exercise was performed, and blood and spirometry were obtained at 1, 5, 15, and 25 min after the end of exercise. A second period of treadmill exercise, of the same level and duration, was then performed, and blood sampling and spirometry were repeated at the same time intervals after the end of exercise. There was no significant (p less than 0.1) difference in baseline plasma epinephrine (Ep), or norepinephrine (Np) levels; however, plasma dopamine (Dp) levels were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in Group 3. In Groups 1 and 2, FEV1 did not change significantly after the first (E1) or second (E2) exercise periods, but there were significant (p less than 0.01) changes in Group 3 (maximal percent changes in FEV1, delta FEV1%, E1 = -14.4%, E2 = -8.8%), and the delta FEV1% after E2 was significantly (p less than 0.01) less than after E1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lovastatin (mevinolin) in the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. A multicenter study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin under controlled conditions in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Five lipid clinics with a central laboratory and coordinating center. PATIENTS: 101 adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were on a lipid-lowering diet throughout the study. After a 4-week placebo baseline period, patients were randomized to five equal treatment groups. Each group received a different sequence of placebo or lovastatin 5 to 40 mg twice daily or 20 to 40 mg once daily in the evening, during three consecutive 6-week periods. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol across the dosage ranges were 14% to 34% and 17% to 39%, respectively (p compared with zero and placebo less than 0.01). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoproteins AI and AII rose slightly. Apolipoprotein B fell substantially at the higher dosage levels (-23% at 40 mg twice daily, p less than 0.01), indicating a reduction in the concentration of circulating low-density lipoprotein particles. Maximum response was achieved in 4 to 6 weeks. Twice-daily dosing was slightly more efficient than once-daily dosing. Of those patients receiving 40 mg twice a day, 89% had a fall in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of at least 20%, and 61% had a fall of at least 40%. Adverse effects attributable to lovastatin were minimal, and no patient was withdrawn from the study. CONCLUSION: Lovastatin was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.</ABSTRACT>

DESIGN: An open sequential study of serum lipoprotein responses in patients receiving diet alone (mean duration, 4 months); colestipol and niacin with diet (mean duration, 9 months); and colestipol, niacin, and lovastatin with diet (mean duration, 15 months). SETTING: Metabolic ward and lipid clinic of a university medical center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with clinical characteristics of familial hypercholesterolemia (low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, greater than 8.48 mmol/L; 21 of 22 with tendon xanthomas). INTERVENTIONS: Diet: less than 200 mg/d of cholesterol and less than 8% of total calories from saturated fat; colestipol, 30 g/d; lovastatin, 40 to 60 mg/d; and niacin, 1.5 to 7.5 g/d. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean total serum cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 4.86 +/- 0.62 mmol/L (188 +/- 24 mg/dL SD) and 2.89 +/- 0.54 mmol/L (112 +/- 21 mg/dL SD), respectively, were significantly lower during ternary-drug treatment than during colestipol-niacin treatment (p less than 0.003) or during treatment in which other possible binary combinations were given. The cholesterol content of very low-density-lipoproteins was lower and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels higher during this phase than during the colestipol-niacin phase. CONCLUSIONS: Colestipol, lovastatin, and niacin are mutually complementary in treating hypercholesterolemia. This regimen produces reductions in serum cholesterol levels similar to those associated with regression of atheromatous plaques in animal studies.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Intravenous verapamil for treatment of multifocal atrial tachycardia with and without calcium pretreatment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Verapamil was given to 16 consecutive patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia. Intravenous verapamil was administered at a rate of up to 1 mg/min while heart rate and systolic blood pressure were being monitored. The final 5 patients received 1 g of intravenous calcium gluconate 5 minutes before treatment with verapamil; the first 11 received no calcium. The mean +/- SD heart rate decreased by 21% from 129 to 101 beats/min, a difference of 28, 95% confidence interval (CI), 18 to 38 (p less than 0.0005 by t-test), after a mean of 22 +/- 13 minutes from the start of verapamil administration. The mean verapamil dose was 17 +/- 7 mg (6 to 30 mg). Sinus rhythm was restored in 8 patients. Pretreatment with calcium did not block the effect of verapamil on heart rate (27% decrease with calcium compared with 19% decrease without calcium, a difference of 8%, 95% CI, -7 to 23; p = 0.29) but minimized the decrease in systolic pressure (11% decrease with calcium compared with 27% decrease without calcium, a difference of 16%, 95% CI, 7 to 27; p less than 0.01). Verapamil caused transient asymptomatic hypotension in 1 patient. Arterial blood gases were unchanged by verapamil. Thus, verapamil is safe and effective therapy for multifocal atrial tachycardia, consistently slowing the heart rate and often restoring sinus rhythm. Calcium pretreatment may reduce drug-induced hypotension without preventing the antiarrhythmic effect.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in drug-refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in preventing sudden death in high-risk patients. DESIGN: Nonrandomized cohort study. SETTING: A university teaching hospital with 500 beds. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 78 patients with symptomatic, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias that were previously drug-refractory. INTERVENTIONS: Before February 1985, patients received treatment with the defibrillator and amiodarone if they presented with loss of consciousness (group A) and amiodarone alone if they did not lose consciousness (group C). After February 1985, because the availability of the defibrillator was severely curtailed, patients who lost consciousness received treatment with amiodarone alone (group B). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The risk for recurrent arrhythmias was similar between groups. The actuarial risk for sudden death in group B was 31% (95% confidence interval, 11% to 51%) at 1 and 2 years, a value that was significantly higher than that for group A (p less than 0.003) or group C (p less than 0.03). The risk for dying suddenly with the first recurrence was 0.78 in group B, a value that was significantly higher than that for group A (p less than 0.003) or group C (p less than 0.002). CONCLUSION: The defibrillator is highly effective in preventing sudden death in patients whose presenting arrhythmias caused loss of consciousness (group A). In patients whose presenting arrhythmias did not result in loss of consciousness (group C), initial treatment with the defibrillator appears unnecessary.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Severe symptomatic hyponatremia: treatment and outcome. A study of 64 cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A serum sodium concentration of 110 mmol/L or less is thought to be extremely dangerous; mortality rates of 33% to 86% have been cited. Experience at the University of Rochester School of Medicine does not corroborate this widespread belief. Among 62 patients with 64 episodes of severe hyponatremia, the mortality rate was only 8%, and most deaths were caused by underlying diseases; with a serum sodium concentration of 105 mmol/L or less, the mortality rate was 5%. Rapid correction of hyponatremia did not account for this favorable prognosis. Only 6% of the 64 cases were corrected to a serum sodium concentration of 120 mmol/L at recommended rates of 1.5 to 2 mmol/(L.h); half of the patients achieved this rate of correction because of a spontaneous water diuresis. In some settings, vigorous therapeutic efforts may have contributed to an adverse outcome. Rapid correction of hyponatremia is not indicated just because the serum sodium concentration is extremely low.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ribavirin treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the acquired-immunodeficiency-syndrome-related complex (ARC). A phase 1 study shows transient clinical improvement associated with suppression of the human immunodeficiency virus and enhanced lymphocyte proliferation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess safety, tolerance, and the clinical and laboratory effects of oral ribavirin in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the AIDS-related complex. DESIGN: Three uncontrolled phase I trials of increasing duration: 14 days, 8 weeks, and 12 months. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a university-referral hospital. PATIENTS: All patients were antibody-positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by radioimmunoprecipitation assay, all had recovered from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and none had Kaposi sarcoma at entry. Nine of ten patients with AIDS had less than 100 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3 at entry and all patients with the AIDS-related complex had fewer than 200 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3. Five patients with AIDS and five with the AIDS-related complex entered the 14-day trial. All but two patients with AIDS went on to the 8-week trial, along with seven additional patients with AIDS. Five surviving patients with AIDS and 3 patients with the AIDS-related complex went on to the 1-year study. INTERVENTIONS: Oral ribavirin, 1200 mg twice daily for 3 days was given, followed by 300 mg twice daily for 11 days. During an 8-week trial, a loading dose of oral ribavirin was administered for 3 days, followed by a dose of 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Prolonged regimen of a 3-day loading dose was given, followed by a dose of 300 mg twice daily for 1 year. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ribavirin treatment was well tolerated, with anemia requiring transfusion in one of the ten patients with AIDS receiving the drug for 8 weeks; no other significant toxicity occurred. Six of nine patients initially positive for HIV-1 in blood became negative during ribavirin treatment. Six of nine patients with AIDS had a twofold improvement in lymphoproliferative response to at least one lectin with ribavirin treatment. Mean survival from first episode of P. carinii pneumonia was 17.3 months in patients with AIDS receiving 8 weeks of ribavirin and 21.2 months in patients with AIDS receiving prolonged treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Oral ribavirin, 600 mg daily, was well tolerated and safe in the patients with severe AIDS and the AIDS-related complex. Ribavirin therapy merits extensive evaluation in a multicenter controlled trial to assess its efficacy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fatal Rhizopus infections in hemodialysis patients receiving deferoxamine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four hemodialysis patients receiving deferoxamine for metal overload had fatal rhinocerebral rhizopus infections. Serious fungal infections are not commonly seen in patients on dialysis, and none of these patients had the usual risk factors for rhizopus infection. Deferoxamine is being used with increased frequency in dialysis patients for aluminum and iron overload states. We propose that there is a link between the deferoxamine therapy and this unusual infection. Deferoxamine may serve as a specific growth factor for Rhizopus species or may alter host immune function. We suggest searching for fungal organisms in patients with unexplained illnesses receiving deferoxamine.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gallium nitrate for treatment of refractory hypercalcemia from parathyroid carcinoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Intractable hypercalcemia is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Because gallium nitrate previously was shown to inhibit the bone resorptive activity of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in vitro, we used it to treat two patients with parathyroid carcinoma and resistant hypercalcemia. In both patients, total serum calcium levels were reduced from initial values of 3.62 and 3.77 mmol/L to posttreatment values of 2.32 and 1.45 mmol/L, respectively. Urinary excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline also declined significantly. Serum PTH levels were lower in both patients after therapy, although all levels remained markedly elevated. Nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate and tubular reabsorption of phosphate remained unchanged. These data indicate that treatment with gallium nitrate can control hypercalcemia in patients with high circulating levels of PTH. Gallium nitrate antagonizes the bone resorptive activity of PTH without altering renal effects of the hormone.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Puncturing the biopsy myth.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- We used decision analysis to compare the conventional strategy of biopsy-tailored therapy with alternative strategies not using renal biopsy in treating adults with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. We evaluated data on steroid and platelet-inhibitor therapies and a new clinical strategy, empiric sequential therapy. This sequential approach involves use of short-term alternate-day steroid agents, followed by long-term platelet inhibitors for persistent nephrotic syndrome. Our results indicate that, contrary to usual practice, use of renal biopsy is not necessary in caring for adult patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; empiric short-term alternate-day steroid therapy is equally efficacious. If the benefits of platelet-inhibitor therapy for treating membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis are confirmed, empiric sequential therapy also will be equally efficacious. Our study shows how decision analysis can be used to identify superfluous diagnostic procedures.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The clinical evolution of Lyme arthritis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To determine the clinical evolution of Lyme arthritis, 55 patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy for erythema chronicum migrans were followed longitudinally for a mean duration of 6 years. Of the 55 patients, 11 (20%) had no subsequent manifestations of Lyme disease. From 1 day to 8 weeks after disease onset, 10 of the patients (18%) began to have brief episodes of joint, periarticular, or musculoskeletal pain for as long as 6 years, but they never developed objective joint abnormalities. From 4 days to 2 years after disease onset, 28 (51%) had one episode or began to have intermittent attacks of frank arthritis, primarily in large joints; a few had polyarticular movement. The total number of these patients who continued to have recurrences decreased by 10% to 20% each year. The remaining 6 patients (11%) developed chronic synovitis later in the illness; of these, 2 (4%) had erosions, and 1 (2%), permanent joint disability. The spectrum of Lyme arthritis ranges from subjective joint pain, to intermittent attacks of arthritis, to chronic erosive disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The effect of timolol on anterior-chamber oxygenation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The effect of timolol maleate, a nonspecific beta-blocking agent, on anterior-segment oxygenation was studied using oxygen-sensitive microelectrodes inserted into the mid-anterior chamber of 13 cat eyes. The anterior-chamber oxygen tension was monitored continuously for two hours following the topical application of three drops of timolol 0.5%. Although a small, but significant, decline in oxygen tension of 19% was observed over the initial 90 minutes (P less than or equal to .05), the overall 10% decrease at the end of two hours was not considered either clinically or statistically significant when compared with a group of controls. Timolol, since it does not contribute significantly to hypoxia, may therefore be a more prudent choice for lowering intraocular pressure in disorders where hypoxia is believed to play an important role, such as in neovascular glaucoma and sickle-cell hyphema.</ABSTRACT>

The iris nodule may be similar to the "typhus nodule" of the central nervous system reported at autopsy in patients with typhus rickettsial disease. Previous case reports of RMSF have emphasized either anterior uveitis or retinal vasculitis. In the case reported here, both occurred in our patient as a result of RMSF. Also, we review the ophthalmic literature on rickettsial disease.</ABSTRACT>

Panretinal photocoagulation was followed by regression of the new iris blood vessels to a greater extent in one patient than in the other. Following carotid endarterectomy, intraocular pressure increased, and, in one case, filtering surgery was required. Possible mechanisms for the rise in intraocular pressure following carotid endarterectomy are discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Factors associated with retinal-vein occlusion in Hispanics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sixty-eight foreign-born Hispanic patients with angiography-proven retinal-vein occlusion (RVO) and 50 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls were evaluated for systemic disease. Thirty of the RVO patients had central retinal-vein occlusion, and 38 had branch retinal-vein occlusion. Hypertension, the most commonly associated factor, was present in 66.2% of the RVO patients in contrast to 18% of the controls (P less than .001). Other factors which were more common in the RVO population included open-angle glaucoma (19.1% vs 8%), diabetes mellitus (16.2% vs 12%), and atherosclerotic heart disease (14.7% vs 10%); these, however, were not statistically significant (P greater than .05). Hyperlipidemia was present in 12% of the controls and 10.3% of the RVO group (P greater than .50). This is in direct contrast to reports of nonHispanic populations where hyperlipidemia has been reported to be present in up to 60% of RVO patients.</ABSTRACT>

One of the groups underwent removal of the epithelium and, and the other was characterized by nonremoval of the epithelium. The corneal sensations were measured serially with an esthesiometer. The return of corneal sensation occurred sooner in the nonremoval group than in the removal group in the early postoperative period, but at three months, the difference was negligible.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Four-hundred-and-sixteen eyes that underwent cataract extraction over six years were analyzed. Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior-chamber intraocular lens implantation (PCIOL) was performed in 186 eyes and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) alone was performed in 230 eyes. The complications and visual acuity were compared in the two groups. The PCIOL group showed a low incidence of postoperative complications. In addition, there were no cases of corneal edema; retinal detachment occurred in 1.33%; cystoid macular edema occurred in 2.67%; and visual acuity recovered to 20/40 or better in 96.67% of eyes. The incidence of complications in the ECCE group was slightly higher.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Sector iridectomy in the management of prolonged attacks of acute congestive glaucoma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Clinicians still encounter patients suffering from prolonged episodes of primary angle-closure glaucoma. These patients often have been misdiagnosed or neglected initially. While laser iridotomies have proven most effective in the treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma, there is a diversity of opinion regarding the treatment of chronic forms, in particular when the congestive phase has been of long duration (e.g., 3 to 14 days). The fact that ophthalmologists must still contend with the dreaded complication of malignant glaucoma attests to the difficulty of treating this condition. A series of cases have been collected during the past 15 years, all having prolonged episodes of primary angle-closure glaucoma, where the anterior-chamber angles could not be opened medically before surgery. We found that laser iridotomy is not efficacious in this situation, and indeed often impossible to perform due to corneal edema. Our patients were treated surgically with sector iridectomies, with an extremely high degree of success, and a minimal complication rate. The results are presented in tabular form. The mechanism of action is described, and the reasons for the success of this procedure explained.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Serious ocular and systemic complications may result from inflammatory processes of the orbit. Temporal arteritis is one such process that can affect the eye. The patient described herein is unusual because she presented initially with signs and symptoms similar to orbital cellulitis. As her disease evolved, she displayed marked, hemorrhagic chemosis with some limitation of abduction and resistance to retropulsion on the involved side. Laboratory and radiologic findings eliminated orbital cellulitis, limited Wegener's granulomatosis, and other systemic inflammatory disorders and led to the diagnosis of temporal arteritis. To our knowledge, this complex of presenting signs has not been previously reported.</ABSTRACT>

- Thirty-two patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) underwent detailed ophthalmologic examination in order to detect the ocular abnormalities associated with this disorder. Three patients had Marfan's syndrome, and 29 had no associated systemic disorders. Of the latter, 19 (65.5%) were myopic (average, 2.00 diopters), 12 (41.4%) had lenticular opacities, and all had unusually deep anterior-chamber angles with prominent iris processes. None of the 29 patients had subluxated lenses. These findings support the view that MVP syndrome can be considered a generalized connective tissue disorder different from Marfan's syndrome.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: I. Early morphological effects of IgG on the presynaptic membrane active zones.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In the freeze-fractured presynaptic membrane of the motor end-plate, the active zones consist of two parallel arrays and each array contains 10- to 12-nm particles arranged in two rows. In the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and in mice treated with 10 mg/day of LEMS IgG, administered intraperitoneally for several weeks, there was a paucity and disorganization of the active zones, and clusters of 10- to 12-nm particles appeared. To further define the changes in the active zones, mice were studied that had been treated over 2 days with 104 to 180 mg of IgG. Treatment transferred the physiological defect of LEMS. Control mice received normal human IgG or no IgG. The spacing and density (number/unit area) of active-zone particles were evaluated in presynaptic membrane P-faces using computer-assisted stereometry. In the normal active zone, the distance between particles in a given row and between adjacent rows of an array was less than, but the distance between the two arrays was greater than, the distance between the two antigen-binding sites on human IgG. In mice treated with LEMS IgG, the initial alteration in the active zone was a decrease in the distance between particles in a given row and between adjacent rows of an array; the distance between the two arrays remained unaltered. In more affected active zones, the parallel orientation of the rows was disturbed and the arrays became clusters. There was a significantly reduced density of active zones and of large-membrane particles associated with all active zones and clusters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Acetylcholine receptors in human thymic myoid cells in situ: an immunohistological study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Myoid cells were studied by double immunofluorescence in sections of thymus from 47 patients with myasthenia gravis and 15 control subjects, using polyclonal sheep anti-troponin T and monoclonal antibodies to troponin I, striated muscle myosin, and acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The myoid cells were rare and located mainly in the medulla, and most were clearly positive for AChR; labeling was similar with four individual monoclonal antibodies specific for extrajunctional AChR and five that also recognize endplate AChR. They were mostly keratin-positive and consistently HLA-DR-negative. In the myasthenia gravis samples, the myoid cells were similar but largely confined to medullary epithelial areas; AChR labeling was slightly weaker, but otherwise they did not differ noticeably from those of control subjects. A preliminary finding was of even rarer AChR-positive/HLA-DR-positive antigen-presenting (possibly) cells seen in 9 of 9 myasthenia gravis samples and in none of 9 control samples. Although myoid-cell AChR appears antigenically similar to extrajunctional muscle AChR, and must therefore express the epitopes that myasthenics' antibodies recognize, these cells do not appear to be foci of immunological stimulation in myasthenia gravis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Platelet membrane abnormality in Alzheimer's disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Fluorescence studies of membrane fluidity were conducted double-blind using platelet and red cell membranes prepared from 24 demented patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and 36 neurologically healthy subjects. The fluidity of the hydrocarbon and lipid-aqueous interface regions of cell membranes was determined at 37 degrees C by fluorescence spectroscopy using the lipid probes 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH), respectively. The rotation rate of TMA-DPH in labeled platelet membranes did not differ between the groups. In contrast, the rotation rate of DPH in labeled platelet membranes from the demented patients (2.15 +/- 0.24 X 10(8)/sec, SD) was greater than that for the normal controls (1.93 +/- 0.13 X 10(8)/sec, SD, p = 3.8 X 10(-5)). This difference was reflected by a reduction in the steady-state anisotropy of DPH in labeled platelets from the demented group (0.1887 +/- 0.0085, SD) when compared to the respective mean for the controls (0.2000 +/- 0.0060, SD; p = 1.3 X 10(-7)). Abnormal membrane fluidity was significantly correlated with severity of dementia, but not with duration of illness or apparent age of onset. The findings do not support the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease results from a pathological acceleration of the normal aging process, since normal aging is associated with decreased fluidity of cell membranes from platelets, as well as from lymphocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Trends in the incidence rates of stroke in Rochester, Minnesota, since 1935.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The Mayo Clinic medical records system and records-linkage system have been used to study trends in the incidence of stroke in Rochester, Minnesota, for comparison with U.S. stroke mortality trends. This study extends the observations back through 1935. The average annual incidence rate for the period 1935 to 1944 was 188 and 179 per 100,000 population for men and women, respectively--not significantly different from 200 for men and 178 for women for the period 1945 to 1954. The blood pressure level in these patients did not affect probability of survival or recurrent stroke. The trend in the incidence rate of stroke for women showed no change for the 20 years from 1935 to 1954, after which there was a gradual decline. For men there was little change until 1969, after which there was a sharp decline. We suggest that the gradual decline in U.S. stroke mortality rates for this early period may include an artifact introduced by changing codes and changing fashions of diagnosis.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Physiological effects of 4-aminopyridine on demyelinated mammalian motor and sensory fibers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The selective response of demyelinated sensory fibers to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the reported paresthesias that complicate the use of this potassium-channel blocking agent in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and neuromuscular disorders. To identify differences in the electrophysiological response of specific fiber types to the application of 4-AP, rat ventral and dorsal spinal roots, demyelinated by intrathecal injections of lysophosphatidylcholine, were examined in vitro before and during potassium-channel blockade. The compound action potentials of demyelinated ventral roots showed a prominent postspike negativity associated with a broadening of single action potentials following application of 4-AP. Under similar conditions, whole root responses of demyelinated dorsal root axons also developed a late negativity, but individual fibers were observed to fire repetitively in response to a single stimulus. The data support the hypothesis that the prominent sensory dysfunctions reported in clinical trials of 4-AP are due to the selective response characteristics of sensory fibers.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Regional cerebral blood flow in Down's syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in 14 patients with Down's syndrome, in 46 patients with Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, and in 114 age-matched controls, using the xenon 133 inhalation technique. Cerebral blood flow was reduced in 13 of 14 Down's patients by a mean of 16.8 +/- 2.5% from expected age-matched normal values. Degrees of regional cerebral blood flow reduction did not differ among the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions in both cerebral hemispheres. The regional cerebral blood flow decreases were similar in magnitude and pattern to those in Alzheimer patients. These findings constitute an additional similarity between the two disorders.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity is decreased in Alzheimer's disease brains.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of epinephrine and a specific marker for epinephrine neurons. We have previously described the stability of this enzyme in a variety of pre- and postmortem conditions in human brain autopsy specimens and demonstrated its presence in areas of the human brain that are associated with memory and attention. We now report on 5 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who had a decrease in PNMT activity of 37 to 48% in areas of the brain affected by the disease but not in the cerebellum, an area of the brain unaffected by the disease. The degree of decrease in PNMT activity in the hippocampus correlated significantly with the degree of dementia. We have provided direct immunochemical evidence that the decrease in PNMT activity in AD is due to the loss of this specific enzyme protein.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Bactericidal activity and killing rate of serum in volunteers receiving teicoplanin alone or in combination with oral or intravenous rifampin.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A total of 10 volunteers, in two groups of 5 each, received the following on separate days: group 1,200 mg of teicoplanin intravenously (i.v.), 600 mg of rifampin orally, or teicoplanin-rifampin; group 2,400 mg of teicoplanin i.v., 300 mg of rifampin i.v. in 60 min, or teicoplanin-rifampin. Blood samples were obtained before, at the end, and at 1 and 6 h after the administration of the antibiotics. Bactericidal activity in serum (SBA) was measured in microtiter plates against 20 clinical isolates (five strains each) of oxacillin-susceptible and-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The endpoint of the SBA corresponded to 99.9% killing. Killing rates were measured in serum obtained at 1 and 6 h. The concentrations of each antibiotic were measured by bioassay. The antibiotic concentrations in serum obtained at the peak and at 1 and 6 h after the end of administration were as follows: group 1, teicoplanin, 26, 15.6, and 8.4 mg/liter; rifampin, not determined, 8.3, and 3.8 mg/liter; group 2, teicoplanin, 66, 29.4, and 11.5 mg/liter; rifampin, 14.8, 3.8, and 1.2 mg/liter. Higher median SBAs were obtained after treatment with rifampin than after that with teicoplanin. No interaction was observed between rifampin and teicoplanin. This was confirmed by determination of the killing rate in serum. Teicoplanin killed more slowly than rifampin. The combination had the same killing rate as rifampin alone. Rifampin neither improved nor antagonized the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin, as determined by the SBAs or the rate of killing.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of roxithromycin after multiple dosing.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pharmacokinetics of the macrolide roxithromycin (RU 28965) were studied during and after administration of 150 mg every 12 h for 3 days (five doses) in six volunteers. The concentrations in serum, blister fluid, and urine were measured. Mean levels in serum taken at 1.5 h after the morning dose increased from 4.4 micrograms/ml on day 1 to 5.9 micrograms/ml on day 2 and 7.4 micrograms/ml on day 3. The mean serum and blister fluid elimination half-lives on day 3 were 13.2 and 12.5 h, respectively. Roxithromycin penetrated blister fluid well; the mean percent penetration (as measured by the ratio of areas under the curve) was 85%. After the final dose, a mean of 10.5% of that dose was recovered in 12 h as microbiologically active compound.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Altered pharmacokinetic disposition of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin after single and multiple doses in rabbits.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The pharmacokinetic disposition of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was assessed in rabbits before the efficacy of these compounds in experimental staphylococcal endocarditis was compared. Ciprofloxacin was given in single intravenous bolus doses of 25 and 35 mg/kg and also in a multiple-dose regimen of 35 mg/kg every 6 h. Vancomycin was given in a similar manner in single doses of 17.5 and 25 mg/kg and in a multiple-dose regimen of 17.5 mg/kg every 6 h. Serum was sampled frequently after injections and analyzed by microbiologic assay for drug concentration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were calculated by compartment-independent methods. These studies revealed that clearance of ciprofloxacin was reduced significantly after multiple doses (7.42 +/- 0.85 [standard deviation] versus 6.09 +/- 0.71 liters/h, P less than 0.01). Although the half-life and volume of distribution increased after multiple dosing, the differences were not statistically significant. The disposition of vancomycin following single doses was significantly altered after the 25-mg/kg dose compared with the 17.5-mg/kg dose. Half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution changed from 1.27 +/- 0.2 to 1.60 +/- 0.21 h (P less than 0.05), 0.54 +/- 0.05 to 0.39 +/- 0.04 liters/h (P less than 0.01), and 0.37 +/- 0.04 to 0.31 +/- 0.03 liters/kg (P less than 0.05), respectively. The disposition of ciprofloxacin was not altered with increases in dose size, and the disposition of vancomycin was not altered after multiple doses. If such alterations in the pharmacokinetic disposition of antimicrobial agents are unanticipated, the higher and more prolonged than expected serum concentrations may have an effect on the outcome of experimental infections.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- In vitro susceptibility of Coxiella burnetii to antibiotics, including several quinolones.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the rickettsial Q fever agent Coxiella burnetii was performed by using persistently infected L929 fibroblast cells. The efficacies of a variety of antibiotics with different metabolic targets were tested and compared. The most effective antibiotics in bringing about the elimination of the parasite from infected cells included several quinolone compounds and rifampin. Of the quinolone compounds tested, difloxacin (A-56619) was the most effective, followed by ciprofloxacin and oxolinic acid. These three quinolones were apparently rickettsiacidal. After 48 h of exposure to microgram amounts of the compounds (ranging from 2 micrograms of difloxacin per ml to 5 micrograms of the other two antibiotics per ml), the number of intracellular parasites markedly declined; after 10 days of treatment, very few intracellular rickettsiae were detected. Rifampin (1 microgram/ml) was also very effective in eliminating the parasites. Some of the 13 other antibiotics tested that were somewhat effective included chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and trimethoprim. The persistently infected L929 cells were found to provide a convenient system for the relatively rapid determination of the susceptibility of C. burnetii to antibiotics.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Inhibition of murine hepatitis virus infections by the immunomodulator 2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-2-phenyl-8,8-dimethoxy-imidazo[1,2a]pyridine (PR-879-317A).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- PR-879-317A (2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-2-phenyl-8,8-dimethoxy-imidazo [1,2a]pyridine) has been found to be a T-cell-selective immunomodulating agent. In the current studies, a series of experiments was designed to determine the potential antiviral activity of this compound in mice infected with murine hepatitis virus. In a comparative antiviral experiment, the activity seen was superior to that of levamisole, a known immunorestorative agent. This activity was characterized by an increase in the 21-day survival frequency, a decrease in hepatic discoloration, a decrease in the amount of infectious virus recoverable from the liver, and normalization of serum glutamic oxalacetate and pyruvate transaminase levels. A comparison of treatment routes indicated the relative efficacies as intraperitoneal greater than per os greater than intramuscular greater than or equal to subcutaneous. Alteration of the treatment schedule markedly affected the antiviral effect; prophylactic or therapeutic treatments once or twice daily for 3 days were usually effective. Single treatments begun 4 h before or 24 h after virus inoculation were highly efficacious. Three treatments administered on alternate days, beginning 48 h before virus inoculation, proved moderately effective. Thrice-daily treatments were ineffective, as were treatments with durations of greater than 3 days. The optimal dosage varied according to the treatment route and dosage schedule. When assessed for direct antiviral activity in vitro, PR-879-317A failed to demonstrate any significant activity against murine hepatitis virus. The positive in vivo activity noted might therefore be the result of immune modulation rather than a direct antiviral effect.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- The therapeutic efficacy of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose [poly(ICLC)] given alone or in combination with ribavirin was evaluated in Swiss Webster mice infected with Rift Valley fever virus. Four or more 20-micrograms doses of poly(ICLC) given at various intervals beginning 24 h after infection protected all mice against death. On the other hand, a treatment regimen consisting of only three doses of poly(ICLC) given 24 h postinfection resulted in a 50% survival rate. When initiated 48 h postinfection, an extended treatment regimen with the same dose was required to yield 40% survivors. Lower doses (5 micrograms) of poly(ICLC) per mouse were only marginally effective even when six injections were given between days 1 and 9 postinfection. The combined administration of ribavirin and poly(ICLC) initiated as late as 48 h postinfection was effective even when treatment consisted of doses that were ineffective when either drug was used alone.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Effects of cefonicid and other cephalosporin antibiotics on male sexual development in rats.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The purpose of this study was to determine whether cefonicid, a cephalosporin antibiotic with a modified N-methylthiotetrazole (MTT) side chain, caused testicular toxicity when subcutaneously administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats from days 6 to 36 postpartum at doses of 50 to 1,000 mg/kg per day. Moxalactam (a cephamycin antibiotic which will be referred to as a cephalosporin for convenience throughout), which contains the MTT side chain, was used as a positive control and was administered at 100 to 1,000 mg/kg per day, and cephalothin, which lacks an MTT side chain, was used as the negative control at 1,000 mg/kg per day. Moxalactam caused a significant reduction in testicular and seminal vesicle weights in 37-day-old animals, and histological examination revealed bilateral multifocal atrophy of the seminiferous tubules at all dose levels. Animals reared to reproductive maturity had significant deficits in fertility, and histological examination revealed multifocal or diffuse atrophy of the seminiferous tubules at all doses with a severity greater than that observed in the 37-day-old animals. The histological findings were confirmed by marked reductions in testicular sperm production rates and cauda epididymal sperm numbers. Cephalothin and cefonicid had no treatment-related adverse effects on the sexual maturation of prepubertal, juvenile, or adult males. The absence (in cephalothin) or modification (in cefonicid) of the MTT side chain was not associated with adverse reproductive effects. The relevance of these findings to humans in prenatal and prepubertal stages of life cannot be determined at this time.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Both (+)-cyclaradine-5'-methoxyacetate (CM) and (+)-cyclaradine-5'-ethoxypropionate (CE) were converted to (+)-cyclaradine (C) in squirrel monkey and human sera at 37 degrees C. CE was more stable than CM. After oral administration (20 mg base equivalent per kg) of either CM or CE, no unchanged esters were observed in serum of squirrel monkeys, rabbits, or rats. Instead, C was detected, indicating conversions of CM and CE to C in vivo. In squirrel monkeys, the areas under the curve (AUCs) of C obtained from oral dosing with CM were 61% higher than those obtained from dosing with C, indicating that CM may be a good prodrug for C. In squirrel monkeys, rabbits, and rats, CE resulted in a 20 to 90% higher AUC of C than did CM, indicating that CE was better absorbed than CM.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The treatment of severe psoriasis. A national survey.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In 1974, we conducted a randomized survey of dermatologists to determine trends in the use of chemotherapeutic agents for psoriasis. The present survey updates and extends the earlier one to include phototherapy, photochemotherapy, and other modalities being used in the treatment of psoriasis too extensive or severe for topical agents alone. Questionnaires were sent to approximately 20% of dermatologists nationwide and also to all training/research programs. Results of the survey include: (1) approximately 523,000 patients with psoriasis were treated by dermatologists in 1984, and 30% of these were severe enough to require more than topical care; (2) the majority of dermatologists use ultraviolet B (71%) and methotrexate (58%), while 36% use psoralen and ultraviolet A; (3) creatinine clearance rates and liver biopsy specimens are being obtained for approximately half of methotrexate-treated patients; and (4) of those physicians using methotrexate, most (74%) use weekly divided orally administered methotrexate doses.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A study was done of extended maintenance therapy using either betamethasone dipropionate (Diprolene) in optimized vehicle (OV) (ointment) or placebo in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Of 59 patients originally enrolled in the study, 38 assessable patients achieved clearing of at least 85% improvement from baseline with traditional betamethasone in OV twice a day for two to three weeks before intermittent pulse dosing was attempted. Thereafter, the test medication was used on weekends (three consecutive doses at 12-hour intervals) once a week. Fourteen patients (74%) of the betamethasone in OV group and four patients (21%) of the placebo group maintained a remission status for 12 weeks. Intermittent pulse dosing with betamethasone in OV seems safe and efficacious maintenance therapy in selected psoriatic patients.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Trade name glucocorticoid formulations triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, and betamethasone valerate were compared with their generic equivalents because of increasing substitution of generic formulations for trade name formulations. The vasoconstrictor assay was the method used for these comparisons. Large differences were found between generic and trade name formulations containing the same steroid in the same concentration in both cream and ointment vehicles. If generic substitutions are to be used for trade name formulations, the physician must be aware that significant differences in therapeutic effectiveness may be expected.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- Pediculosis pubis (PP) is a common sexually transmitted disease. Current therapy with 1% lindane or various synergized pyrethrins as a single dose has been accepted as adequate by the medical community. We treated 53 men with the diagnosis of PP with either 1% lindane (Kwell) shampoo for four minutes or 1% permethrin (Nix) creme rinse for ten minutes, according to random assignment. All patients combed with fine-toothed combs immediately after therapy. They were examined for tolerance and efficacy at 24 to 48 hours and again at ten days (eight- to 12-day range). In the lindane group, ten (40%) of 25 subjects were infested at the final assessment. In the permethrin group, 12 (43%) of 28 subjects were infested at the final assessment. The difference was not statistically significant. Both treatments were well tolerated, with one mild adverse reaction in each group. We concluded that both agents were equivalent in the treatment of PP. On the basis of the high failure rate, we propose that the therapy of PP with any agent should include a second treatment at ten days.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Thin malignant melanomas with regression and metastases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The significance of partial regression in thin malignant melanomas (0.76 mm or less) of the skin was evaluated to determine if the regression was associated with the later development of metastases in patients who previously were considered to have a favorable prognosis. Of 575 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma treated and followed up by the Division of Surgical Oncology at the University of Illinois, Chicago, we found that 103 (18%) had tumors that measured less than 0.76 mm. Of these, 30 (29%) showed histologic evidence of partial regression. In six (20%) of the 30 patients, visceral metastases developed and the patients died. All six had more than 77% regression of their primary tumors. Of the remaining 24 patients, only one had regression greater than 77% and she is still alive three years after diagnosis. Most of these 24 (83%) patients had regression of less than 50% (mean, 29.9%). No metastasis occurred in the 73 patients who had thin melanomas without histologic evidence of regression. It is apparent from this study that patients with thin melanomas who show partial regression cannot be included in the "low-risk" group if the extent of regression is 75% to 80% or more.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Melanoma within a southwestern Hispanic population.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The New Mexico Melanoma Registry and New Mexico Tumor Registry identified 81 cases of melanoma involving the skin and mucous membranes of Hispanics. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of these tumors were compared with those observed in whites. The frequency of melanoma in Hispanics appears to be no more than a sixth of that observed in whites. Female patients were more prevalent within the Hispanic population. The median patient age at diagnosis was similar in Hispanics and whites. A much larger proportion of melanomas in Hispanics occurred on the palms, soles, and in subungual regions. Acral lentiginous melanomas were correspondingly more frequent among Hispanics, as was mucous membrane melanoma. Melanomas arising from the palms, soles, subungual regions, and mucous membranes tended to be advanced in stage, to occur in older individuals, and to metastasize. These cases explain the generally poorer prognosis for Hispanic patients compared with whites. The epidemiology of melanoma relevant to these findings is discussed.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Clinical and histologic features of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is commonly thought of as a disease of young adults, yet we identified five cases, involving patients who were 3, 5, 6, 8, and 11 years of age, among 13,000 consecutive specimens submitted to a general dermatopathology laboratory during a 15-week period. The clinical and histologic features of PLEVA in our cases were similar to those reported for adults, except that no lesions were observed on the scalp or mucous membranes of children. A high index of suspicion and biopsy specimens of suspected lesions are often needed to differentiate PLEVA from other papular and crusted eruptions seen in the pediatric age group. These include reactions to arthropods, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, varicella, and erythema multiforme. Histologically, papular eczema and pityriasis rosea may be misdiagnosed as PLEVA.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis caused by Exserohilum rostratum in an immunocompetent host.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A healthy, 55-year-old woman developed a subcutaneous abscess and systemic symptoms of nausea, dizziness, and chills following minor trauma to her leg. Histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed golden-brown colored mycelial elements, and culture resulted in growth of a dematiaceous fungus identified as Exserohilum rostratum. Surgical excision of the abscess and concomitant oral therapy with ketoconazole resulted in resolution of symptoms. In previously reported cases of human phaeohyphomycosis caused by Exserohilum and related Bipolaris species in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, treatment has varied from topical antimicrobial therapy to combined surgery and intravenous antifungal chemotherapy. Our experience leads us to believe that surgical debridement of an accessible focus of infection along with orally administered ketoconazole may provide adequate therapy in an immunocompetent host.</ABSTRACT>

We describe a 20-year-old black woman who fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of KS and excluded other possible causes. In addition, we reviewed data on 21 patients with adult KS reported in the English literature and accepted ten cases as representing this syndrome. The epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features of the 11 cases representing adult KS are discussed. Although the initial reports of adult KS in the United States may have actually represented toxic shock syndrome, the occurrence of KS in adults should be acknowledged.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- An elderly man presented with bright red-to-purple confluent nodules and plaques of the scalp that appeared clinically consistent with angiosarcoma. He had undergone surgical removal of a similar lesion from his left temple seven months before this presentation. Although routine histologic examination was not sufficient for diagnosis, Merkel cell carcinoma was diagnosed by immunohistochemical studies and electron microscopy. In addition, oat cell carcinoma of the lung was excluded with a computed tomographic scan of his chest. With chemotherapy, the recurrent and metastatic lesions of Merkel cell carcinoma completely resolved, rapidly recurred, and resolved a second time with chemotherapy. Eight months following the fourth course of chemotherapy, the patient again developed widespread cutaneous lesions. He committed suicide within one month of this last recurrence. An autopsy revealed no primary tumor other than of the skin.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Dietary management of dermatitis herpetiformis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extremely itchy, papulovesicular skin disease characterized in part by the presence of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction. Eighty-five percent to 90% of DH patients have granular deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, and essentially all of these patients have an associated, for the most part asymptomatic, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). The association of GSE and DH suggested that the cutaneous manifestations of DH could be controlled by the use of a gluten-free diet. Institution of a gluten-free diet in patients with DH and granular IgA deposits has been shown to be effective in controlling the cutaneous eruption of DH. Seventy percent to 100% of patients who begin a strict gluten-free diet have been shown to be able to decrease the dosage of medication needed to control their DH after a mean of eight to 18 months on the diet. Furthermore, 40% to 70% of patients with DH can control their skin disease completely, without any medication, after longer periods of time on the gluten-free diet (two years and longer). Although the gluten-free diet has been shown to be of great benefit in the control of the skin manifestations of DH, at the present time there is no evidence to suggest that the gluten-free diet is in any way protective against the risk of intestinal lymphoma that has been documented in GSE. Evaluation of the cutaneous IgA deposits in DH skin after long periods of time on a gluten-free diet suggests that there may be a slight decrease in the intensity of the IgA deposits, but the true pathogenetic relationship between the cutaneous IgA deposits, the cutaneous manifestations of DH, and the associated GSE remains unknown.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Metallothionein gene regulation in Menkes' syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The characteristic feature of Menkes' disease is a maldistribution of bodily copper; decreased copper levels are present in the serum, brain, and liver, whereas excess levels are present in gut, kidney, and most other nonhepatic tissues. Using cultured fibroblasts, we have shown that low extracellular copper concentrations induce synthesis of metallothionein, a copper-binding protein, in Menkes' cells but not in normal cells. This is due to a defect in a diffusable regulatory factor that is probably involved in copper metabolism. To further understand the role of the defective factor in transcription, assays have been developed to study the metal-dependent binding of nuclear proteins to metallothionein gene control sequences.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Early acquisition of cytomegalovirus infection.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Two hundred and fifty three infants were screened for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the urine at birth and were followed up at regular intervals for one year. Twelve per cent (of 249) were excreting virus at 3 months, and 20% (of 234) at 12 months. In all cases infection was subclinical. The major factors determining risk of acquiring infection were the mother's serological state and whether the infant was breast fed. There was no association with social class, mother's age, or whether the child had been in a special care baby unit or a postnatal ward. By one year 33% (of 123) of infants of seropositive mothers had acquired CMV infection compared with 4% (of 123) born to seronegative mothers. Twenty per cent (17) of seropositive women who breast fed had virus isolated from their breast milk on at least one occasion, and 76% (13) of their infants became infected. In four mother-infant pairs comparison of CMV isolates from the mother's milk and the child's urine was made by restriction endonuclease digestion; in each pair infection had apparently occurred with the same strain of virus. All 13 infected infants followed up for three years were still shedding virus. Infection with CMV is common in infancy, and virus shedding persists for years. Congenital infection cannot be distinguished from acquired infection unless the presence of CMV in the urine is identified within three or four weeks after birth, even when clinical problems suggestive of congenital infection are present.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Maternal smoking during pregnancy and lower respiratory tract illness in early life.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- In a national study of 12,743 children maternal, but not paternal, smoking was confirmed as having a significant influence on the reported incidence of bronchitis and admission to hospital for lower respiratory tract illness during the first five years of life. Reported rates of admissions to hospital for lower respiratory tract diseases were found to be as high in children born to mothers who stopped smoking during pregnancy as in those whose mothers smoked continuously both during and after pregnancy. Rates of admissions to hospital for lower respiratory tract diseases in children whose mothers started smoking only postnatally were no higher than in those whose mothers remained non-smokers. Postnatal smoking seemed to exert a significant influence on the reported incidence of bronchitis, but less than smoking during pregnancy. These findings suggest that maternal smoking influences the incidence of respiratory illnesses in children mainly through a congenital effect, and only to a lesser extent through passive exposure after birth.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Breast feeding increases concentrations of IgA in infants' urine.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- To investigate the influence of breast feeding on mucosal immunity the concentrations and daily outputs of IgA and lactoferrin in urine were measured in 10 breast fed and 12 infants fed on formula milk at 6 and 12 weeks of age. The concentrations and outputs of secretory IgA in urine were significantly higher in the breast fed group by a factor of three. The secretion of IgA in urine by the breast fed infants was characteristic of the baby and was not related to the intake of IgA from breast milk. Lactoferrin concentrations were similar in the two groups at both ages. In addition to secretory IgA, two thirds of all samples contained proteins with alpha chain but no secretory component antigenic determinants. Breast feeding seems to increase the local production of secretory IgA into the urinary tract during early childhood, thus providing enhanced protection from infection.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Fluctuating dystonia responsive to levodopa.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Four cases of hereditary progressive dystonia with diurnal fluctuation were studied. All were sporadic; three of them mimicked spastic diplegia; and the fourth showed some similarity to torsion dystonia. Emotional or cognitive disturbance, or both, was seen in three. The correct diagnosis was suggested by fluctuating signs and symptoms, which worsened towards evening, but this was reached only after many years of handicap, hospital admissions, and invasive diagnostic procedures. Typically there was a prompt, pronounced, and sustained response to moderate doses of levodopa. Sleep recordings were obtained in three patients and showed increased body movements during rapid eye movement sleep. Several close relatives had periods of increased leg movements during sleep. It is suggested that hereditary dystonia responsive to levodopa should be considered as the diagnosis in children with fluctuating signs of motor disability syndromes, simulating torsion dystonia or spastic diplegia. Polysomnographic studies may be helpful in diagnosis and may also detect early or subclinical cases.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Glycosylated haemoglobin and glucose intolerance in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Sixty four patients, age range 1-20 years, with cystic fibrosis had their tolerance to glucose assessed according to their glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) concentrations. Raised concentrations were found in 24 (37.5%). Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed on 21 patients with raised HbA1 and 13 patients with normal HbA1 concentrations. C peptide responses were also measured to assess islet cell function. Patients with normal HbA1 had normal glucose tolerance and C peptide response. Seven of 21 patients with raised HbA1 concentrations were glucose intolerant. The remaining 14 patients with raised HbA1 concentrations had normal glucose tolerance but a reduced C peptide response, suggesting impaired islet cell function. There were no appreciable differences in the incidence of chest infections, respiratory function, and chest x-ray scores among patients with normal HbA1 concentrations, raised HbA1 concentrations, and normal oral glucose tolerant tests, and patients who were glucose intolerant. No correlation was found between HbA1 concentration and age or Shwachman score. Measuring HbA1 concentrations periodically is useful in detecting and monitoring glucose intolerance in patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- A 12 year old boy and his two sisters with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and renal impairment were studied. Three generations of this family had autoimmune thyroid disease: Graves' disease was diagnosed in the first generation, and the second and third generations had thyroid enlargement with abnormal thyroid function and immunological abnormalities. The disease in this family could not be explained simply by the types of human leucocyte antigens found. Renal disease in autoimmune thyroid disease is uncommon, treatment difficult, and the prognosis unknown. The proteinuria disappeared in all three children during the three and a half years of follow up, which implies that the renal impairment may be transitory in some patients.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of budesonide and beclomethasone dipropionate for treatment of asthma.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD) were each given in a dose of 200 micrograms twice daily by metered dose inhaler to 10 asthmatic children already dependent on treatment with steroids. In a double blind randomised crossover study each course lasted one month. No clinically important differences were found between the two treatments when symptom scores, symptom free days, additional use of salbutamol, and results of lung function tests were considered. Metyrapone mildly reduced the plasma concentration of 11-deoxycortisol in two patients during treatment with budesonide, and in four during treatment with beclomethasone. It is concluded that although they are usually safe, both drugs may cause mild adrenal suppression when given in a dose of 200 micrograms twice daily.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Children and mothers at clinics: who is disturbed?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred and eighty one white children aged 6 to 11 years who were attending medical outpatient clinics with their mothers were studied to assess the prevalence of psychological disturbance in the children, and anxiety and depression in the mothers. Teachers were also asked to assess the children independently using the Rutter scales. Mothers assessed 70 (39%) of the children as being disturbed, 20 of whom were also assessed as being disturbed by their teachers. A further 15 children were assessed as being disturbed by their teachers but not by their mothers. Thirty five (19%) of the mothers assessed themselves as anxious and two as depressed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Anxious and depressed mothers were significantly more likely to assess their child as being disturbed. In contrast, the teachers' assessments of the children were not affected by the mental state of the mothers. These findings confirm that mothers' perceptions of their children are modified by their own moods.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Energy and nitrogen balances in very low birthweight infants.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Energy and nitrogen balances were performed in 12 very low birthweight infants fed on either human milk or on a preterm formula. Energy and nitrogen retention were significantly higher in those given the formula feed (p less than 0.05). Highly significant correlations were found between nitrogen intake and nitrogen retention and between energy retention and nitrogen retention (p less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis failed to show any effect of energy retention on the correlation between nitrogen intake and nitrogen retention in babies fed on human milk. Protein deficiency seems to be the most likely explanation of poor growth in infants fed on human milk.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Comparison of weight:height ratio and arm circumference in assessment of acute malnutrition.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Doctors working in famine relief commonly use the weight:height ratio and the circumference of the mid-upper arm to assess the nutritional state of children under 5. Threshold values indicating moderate and severe malnutrition are usually taken as 80% and 70%, respectively, of the expected weight:height ratio and arm circumferences of 13.5 cm and 12.5 cm, respectively. A study of 1260 children aged 1-5 showed that the thresholds of these two variables yielded significantly different proportions of children with malnutrition, the proportion being much larger when arm circumference was used as the criterion. Adjusting the thresholds would result in closer correspondence between the two variables.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pitfalls in developmental diagnosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- I have never seen a paper or chapter of a book devoted to pitfalls and mistakes in developmental diagnosis. This paper is designed to try to fill the gap. It concerns the avoidance of mistakes in developmental diagnosis and is based entirely on mistakes that I have made myself and now learned to try to avoid and on mistakes that I have seen, most of them repeatedly. I have made no mention of mistakes that could theoretically be made but that I have not personally seen. I believe that most assessment errors are due to overconfidence and to the view that developmental diagnosis is easy. Many other mistakes are due to reliance on purely objective tests with consequent omission of a detailed history and physical examination, so that factors that profoundly affect development but are not directly related to the child's mental endowment are not weighed up before an opinion is reached.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Peripheral neurotoxicity in workers exposed to inorganic mercury compounds.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of the median motor, median sensory, and sural nerves was assessed in 16 workers chronically exposed to various inorganic mercury compounds. Exposed workers were compared with an unexposed control group using t test analyses. Slowing of the median motor nerve NCV was found, which was correlated with both increased levels of mercury in blood and urine, and with increased number of neurologic symptoms. Sensitive evaluation of neural function was found to be practical and informative for investigating mercury toxicity. Such evaluation can help determine safe mercury levels at the workplace.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Environmental and occupational exposures to chrysotile asbestos: a comparative microanalytic study.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Previous light microscopic analysis of lung tissue from persons living close to a large open-pit asbestos mine demonstrated asbestos body counts intermediate between those of referents and those of miners and millers. In this study, we examined via electron microscopy and x-ray energy dispersive spectrometry autopsy lung specimens from individuals ascertained to be environmentally or occupationally exposed and from a referent group. Environmental group concentrations of chrysotile fibers longer than 5 microns were significantly higher than those of referents, and 50% lower than those observed in the occupational group. Tremolite was markedly increased in the occupational group, but only marginally greater in the environmentally exposed. Electron-microscopy-derived concentrations of amphibole fibers longer than 5 microns correlated well with light microscopic asbestos body counts in the occupational group but not in the environmental or referent groups. Chrysotile concentration was not related to asbestos body concentration in any group. Crocidolite fiber, a commercial amphibole not native to the region, was nonetheless identified in lung tissue from 15 of 23 chrysotile miners and millers. Environmental exposure to asbestos fiber as a result of residence within 40 km of the mines results in increased lung chrysotile content.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Exposure to alcohol and tobacco and the risk of laryngeal cancer.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The association between various risk factors and laryngeal cancer was evaluated using a case-control design. Subjects were chosen from the Missouri Cancer Registry from 1984 and 1985. The analysis was limited to white males and included 63 cases and 200 controls. The odds ratios (ORs) associated with previous tobacco use, adjusted for age and alcohol use, followed an increasing linear trend (p less than .01). Similarly, a dose-response relationship between alcohol use and laryngeal cancer (p less than .05) was identified. The risk for laryngeal cancer was increased synergistically by alcohol and tobacco. After controlling for alcohol and tobacco, the only occupational category with an elevated risk was nonconstruction laborers (OR = 3.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.87-5.77). Further studies of the interaction between alcohol and tobacco, occupational factors, and laryngeal cancer etiology are suggested.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Pulmonary impairment in a cotton textile factory in Nigeria: is lifetime alcohol intake with low cigarette smoking a confounding factor?</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A study of 60 Nigerian workers who seldom smoked and who were exposed for 2-15 yr in the printing, dyeing, and maintenance sections of a cotton textile factory showed a 38% airway and 20% "probably airway" symptoms. The airway symptoms were significantly (p less than .005) associated with a decrement in spirometric lung function before and after adjustment for age, height, and duration of employment. The change in residual pulmonary function (PFT) per year of employment was three times higher for the subjects with airway symptoms than for subjects presenting no symptoms. Lifetime alcohol intake was significantly (.025 greater than p less than .01) negatively correlated with pulmonary function and obstructive and restrictive lung disease parameters. Together with body weight, alcohol bottle-years accounted for between 18 and 22% of the variation in lung function, in a forward and reverse stepwise regression analysis. When duration of employment was standardized, subjects with considerable alcohol intake had significantly (.025 greater than p less than .005) lower pulmonary function before and after adjustment for age and height. When the residual PFT was further adjusted for duration of employment, the subjects with higher alcohol intake had significantly (.01 greater than p less than .005) higher residual per year of employment. The subjects presenting airway symptoms had significantly (.05 greater than p less than .005) higher alcohol intake than those in other symptom categories. These data suggest that alcohol intake is a probable confounder in the observed airway and PFT changes.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- A retrospective cohort study of mortality among New York State Farm Bureau members.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- A retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine mortality among 18,811 male farm owners and operators in New York State from 1973-1984. Farm Bureau membership lists were used to identify the study population, and vital status was determined through record linkage with death certificate and motor vehicle files. The comparison group consisted of the 1980 United States Census population of men who resided in the same towns as did the farmers. The results indicated that the study cohort experienced fewer than the expected numbers of deaths overall and for each major cause category except accidents. Specific causes with significant mortality deficits included cancer of the lung (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 47.0); diabetes mellitus (SMR = 57.5); ischemic heart disease (SMR = 65.3); bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma (SMR = 26.7); and cirrhosis of the liver (SMR = 29.7). The only specific cause with a significantly elevated mortality was accidents other than motor vehicle (SMR = 146.5). The investigation differs from previous research in method, setting, and population, but the pattern of findings is generally consistent with that of other studies.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptom effects of long-term cumulative exposure to ambient levels of total suspended particulates and sulfur dioxide in California Seventh-Day Adventist residents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms due to long-term exposure to ambient levels of total suspended particulates (TSP) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) symptoms was ascertained using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) respiratory symptoms questionnaire on 7,445 Seventh-Day Adventists. They were non-smokers, at least 25 yr of age, and had lived 11 yr or more in areas ranging from high to low photochemical air pollution in California. Participant cumulative exposures to each pollutant in excess of four thresholds were estimated using monthly residence zip code histories and interpolated dosages from state air monitoring stations. These pollutant thresholds were entered individually and in combination in multiple logistic regression analyses with eight covariables including passive smoking. Statistically significant associations with chronic symptoms were seen for: SO2 exposure above 4 pphm (104 mcg/m3), (p = .03), relative risk 1.18 for 500 hr/yr of exposure; and for total suspended particulates (TSP) above 200 mcg/m3, (p less than .00001), relative risk of 1.22 for 750 hr/yr.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Selenium status, lipid peroxides concentration, and glutathione peroxidase activity in the blood of power station and rubber factory workers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Concentration of selenium in whole blood and plasma, lipid peroxides in plasma, and glutathione peroxidase activities in red blood cell hemolysates and plasma were determined in 49 coal power plant workers and in 50 rubber factory workers. The results were compared with those obtained for 58 nonindustrial controls. Whole blood selenium was significantly lower and plasma lipid peroxides were significantly higher in power plant workers when compared to the nonindustrial group. In the rubber factory workers, whole blood selenium and red blood cells and plasma glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly lower than in the control group. Urinary output of selenium was also significantly decreased in rubber factory workers. Slightly elevated lipid peroxides were also observed in that group. It seems reasonable to conclude that the lower blood selenium and decreased urinary output of this element may result from increased loss of selenium with perspiration. No correlation has been observed between selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity and between enzyme activity and lipid peroxides concentration in the industrial group.</ABSTRACT>

<ABSTRACT>
- This paper presents the results of a prospective study of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and identifies the variables that are predictive of long-term success. The variables believed to be important prognostically were recorded for 984 consecutive PTAs performed between July 1978 and July 1986. Success or failure was defined using a combination of clinical and objective vascular laboratory criteria. The overall long-term success was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between curves of success rate versus time for each variable were determined by the Wilcoxon and log-rank statistics. The combination of variables associated with success were determined by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. For all cases, the initial success rate was 88.6 +/- 1.0% and at 5 years was 48.2 +/- 2.3%. The following variables, when considered individually, were associated with success (p less than 0.05): indication for PTA, site of PTA, severity of lesion, runoff, number of sites dilated, diabetes, and the occurrence of a complication. From the Cox model, by using a stepwise multiple regression procedure, the following combination of variables were found to be predictive of success (p less than 0.05): (1) indication (claudication vs. salvage), (2) site (common iliac vs. other), (3) severity of lesion (stenosis vs. occlusion), and (4) runoff (good vs. poor). For all combinations of these four significant variables, curves of the success rate versus time were calculated. In conclusion, this study has identified the combination of four variables that together predict if PTA is likely to be successful in the management of a patient with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Experimental and clinical results with proximal end-to-end duodenojejunostomy for pathologic duodenogastric reflux.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Existing Roux-en-Y bile diversion procedures for duodenogastric reflux coupled with distal gastric resection or antrectomy and vagotomy have varied success due to interruption of the physiologic relationships between stomach and duodenum, the reduction of the gastric reservoir, the side effects of vagotomy, and the effect of the Roux limb on gastric emptying. A new bile diversion procedure, suprapapillary Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy, was studied, which eliminates the need for gastric resection to prevent jejunal ulcers by preserving duodenal inhibition of gastric acid secretion and the protective effects of duodenal secretion on the surrounding mucosa. Experimentally, the incidence of jejunal ulceration was significantly decreased by the preservation of the proximal duodenum. Clinically, bile diversion by suprapapillary Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy alleviates symptoms of duodenogastric reflux disease without being ulcerogenic (in the presence of normal gastric secretion) or prolonging gastric emptying.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- The early fate of venous repair after civilian vascular trauma. A clinical, hemodynamic, and venographic assessment.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Repair of major venous injuries of the extremities has been advocated to improve limb salvage rates and to prevent the early and late sequelae of venous interruption. The contribution of venous repair to the surgical outcome remains controversial, however, in part because the fate of venous reconstruction has previously not been well defined. The current study was done to determine the early patency rate of venous repair, to compare the accuracy of various methods used to assess venous patency, and to analyze the relationship between early venous patency and surgical outcome. During a recent 27-month period, 36 patients with major extremity venous injuries were treated by venous reconstruction; 34 patients (94%) had an associated major arterial injury that also required repair. Venous repair was performed in the upper extremity (22%) as well as the lower extremity (78%) using various reconstructive methods, including lateral repair (17%), end-to-end anastomosis (11%), autogenous vein patching (25%), interposition autogenous vein grafting (42%), and panelled autogenous vein grafting (6%). After operation, venous repair patency was evaluated by clinical examination, impedence plethysmography, and Doppler ultrasonography, and contrast venography. There were no perioperative deaths in these 36 patients. The limb salvage rate was 100% and all 34 major arterial repairs were patent at the time of hospital discharge. Venography performed on the seventh postoperative day demonstrated that 14 venous repairs had thrombosed (39%) and that 22 had remained patent (61%). Local venous repair had a significantly lower thrombosis rate (21%) than those requiring interposition vein grafting (59%) (p less than 0.03). Compared with venography, the clinical evaluation was 67% accurate in the assessment of venous repair patency, and the noninvasive examination was 53% accurate. In conclusion, a substantial percentage of venous repairs will thrombose in the postoperative period, especially if interposition vein grafting is used. However, in this series limb salvage was not adversely influenced by an unexpectedly high rate of venous repair thrombosis. In addition, clinical evaluation and noninvasive testing did not provide an accurate assessment of venous patency after venous repair.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Computerized axial manometry of the esophagus. A new method for the assessment of antireflux operations.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- This is a presentation of a new manometric parameter of the mechanical competence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the lower esophageal sphincter vector volume (LESVV). It is determined by computer analysis of continuous-pressure measurements during constant speed pullback of a radially oriented 4- 6- or 8-channel manometry catheter across the LES. Patients were studied with this method both before aggressive medical therapy for esophagitis and before and after Nissen fundoplication. LESVV accurately predicted failure of medical therapy and success of the fundoplication. In patients with successful fundoplication, LESVV demonstrated a 100-fold increase in mechanical competence of the LES, even in the absence of increased LES pressure or length, increasing from 113 +/- 63 mm3 to 11357 +/- 3733 mm3.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Gastroplasty and fundoplication for complex reflux problems. Long-term results.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Between 1964 and 1984, 430 patients with complex reflux problems were managed by a modified Collis gastroplasty and partial fundoplication. The indications for selecting the addition of gastroplasty were as follows: (1) obvious acquired shortening due to peptic esophagitis and stricture, and (2) subtler degrees of acquired shortening frequently encountered in cases that required reoperation and in patients with massive sliding hiatal hernia. The addition of gastroplasty in this second group obviates the risk of even minimal tension on the repair. Follow-up is complete in 382 patients (90%), and extends 1-20 years. Two hundred fifty patients have been followed up for 5 or more years and 101 patients for more than 10 years. Results were classified as follows: good: asymptomatic, or inconsequential symptoms requiring no therapy; fair: improved, but with symptoms and/or endoscopic findings requiring intermittent therapy; poor: unimproved or worse. Patients are divided into four categories, and the results are tabulated below (see Table 2). The best results are obtained in patients with acquired shortening due to esophagitis with and without stricture who have had no prior antireflux surgery and have no associated primary motor disorder. The proportion of unsatisfactory results is almost tripled (20% fair or poor) after reoperation after one or more failed antireflux procedures. When reflux esophagitis and stricture are associated with a primary motor disorder, only half of the patients have a good result sustained throughout long-term follow-up.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Long-term evaluation of aortic valvotomy for congenital aortic stenosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Aortic valvotomy (AV) for relief of congenital aortic stenosis (AS) is a palliative operation, and the purpose of this study was to determine the long-term benefit. After analyzing the symptoms at time of operation, 177 patients were separated by age at AV: newborns (1-14 days) 26, infants (2 weeks-1 year) 19, and children (greater than or equal to 1 year) 132. The newborn with critical AS typically presents with severe cardiac failure and the infant with moderate failure, whereas children may be asymptomatic. In the newborn group, final diagnosis has been made exclusively by noninvasive cardiac echogram since 1984. The presence of a hypoplastic left ventricle (HLV) and/or endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) are the most important determinants of mortality. Operative survival was 11 of 13 (85%) in the newborn group if HLV/EFE were not present. No operative deaths for AV occurred after 1965 in children. When present, a preoperative electrocardiographic strain pattern resolved in 80% of patients. Of 33 reoperations (21%), four were required 1.0 (0.5-2) years later for newborns, five were required for infants 7.2 (1.5-20) years later, and 24 were required in children 11.0 (1.5-25) years later. These included 10 repeat valvotomies and 23 aortic valve replacements (AVRs) with a 91% survival rate. In summary, although valves of patients with congenital AS are morphologically abnormal, valvotomy is beneficial. It was found that (1) the operative survival rate has been 100% over the past 20 years for children and currently is greater than 80% in newborns in the absence of HLV/EFE; (2) reoperation rate is higher in newborns and infants; (3) benefit was shown by a sharp decrease in obstruction initially and improved ECG later; (4) long-term follow-up revealed a subset of patients who are asymptomatic and have only mild residual obstruction over 20 years after AV.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for chronic ulcerative colitis. Long-term results.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- The aim of this study was to determine the long-term outcome among 390 patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis and whether patient or operative factors influenced results. The combined operative morbidity rate for the pouch-anal anastomosis and the subsequent closure of the temporary ileostomy was 29% (bowel obstruction, 22%; pelvic sepsis, 5%), with one death due to pulmonary embolus. The probability of a successful outcome at 5 years was 94%. Of the 24 patients who failed (6% of total), 18 did so within 1 year (4%), three during year 2 (1%), three during year 3 (1%), and none thereafter. Stool frequency (7 stools/24 h), the occurrence of pouchitis (14%), and satisfactory daytime continence (94% of patients) remained stable over 4 years after operation, whereas nocturnal fecal spotting decreased (51% of patients to 20%). Women had more spotting than men, whereas patients over 50 years old had more stools per day than those 50 years or younger. In conclusion, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis achieved a reasonable stool frequency and satisfactory continence in patients with ulcerative colitis over the long-term. These results support the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as a safe, satisfactory alternative to permanent ileostomy.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Upper extremity ischemia caused by small artery disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- One hundred patients with ischemic finger ulceration had detailed prospective evaluation to determine the incidence of associated diseases, response to treatment, and natural history of the condition. A potentially serious associated disease was detected in each patient including autoimmune disease in 54%, Buerger's disease in 9%, arteriosclerosis obliterans in 9%, hypersensitivity angiitis in 22%, and miscellaneous diseases in 6%. Conservative treatment with soap and water scrubs, antibiotics, and local resection/debridement resulted in long-term healing without recurrence in 88% of patients. Most recurrences occurred in patients with autoimmune disease, usually scleroderma or CRST.</ABSTRACT>

<TITLE>- Splenectomy for primary and recurrent immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Current criteria for patient selection and results.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
- Of 565 patients with thrombocytopenia admitted to Duke University Hospital between 1975 and 1985, 100 had splenectomy. Ninety-eight patients had failed chronic immunosuppressive therapy and three patients had acute intracranial bleeding or total absence of platelets in the peripheral blood smear, and had urgent splenectomy. At primary splenectomy, accessory spleens were identified and resected in 18% of patients. There was no operative mortality. Fifty-eight patients had an excellent response to splenectomy and their steroids were tapered off within 3 weeks. Thirteen patients had a poor response to primary splenectomy of whom eight remitted spontaneously and five required accessory splenectomy resulting in complete remission in three patients. Twenty-nine patients were considered nonresponders, 25 of whom had radionuclide scanning for accessory spleens. Seven of these patients had accessory spleens identified but only four consented to accessory splenectomy. In three of the four patients, a complete remission was achieved. Neither platelet antibody titers nor measurements of platelet survival or turnover predicted platelet response to splenectomy. However, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in older patients was significantly less likely to respond to splenectomy. These data support continuing use of splenectomy in selected patients with ITP and an aggressive search for accessory spleens in patients who relapse since they are easily localized at operation by hand-held isotope detector probe.</ABSTRACT>
